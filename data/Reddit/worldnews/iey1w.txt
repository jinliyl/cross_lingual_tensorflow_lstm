1	6	"to drop the case against all 139 anti-tax avoidance campaigners"  What the hell is "anti-tax avoidance'? It's either tax avoidance or tax support.
1	4	So 139 people went into a store, caused a ruckus, and would not leave. I don't really care if they get prosecuted or not. I don't hold any particular love for fortnam and mason (though their tea is good), but it seems like they did something illegal.  If I went into any other store and started yelling, and refused to leave, then I would be arrested. It doesn't really matter what I was yelling, maybe the store was doing something wholly illegal. It doesn't matter, it's still not legal to go into a store and yell.  You can't protest against a private company on their own property. You can only choose not to go there or buy their products.

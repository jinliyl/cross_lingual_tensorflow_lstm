1	6	I think the most troubling aspect of this is that the basketcase socialist tendencies of the Greek people are not being represented.  That's more important than whether or not they resurrect the Drachma or want to pay their taxes.    The only issue really being debated is whether Greece will fail now, or later.  What's really happening is that current investors in Greece, domestic or foreign, are demanding that their current risk be displaced onto the various publics around the world, or other investors.  Essentially, it is another transfer of risk from a set of private groups to the usual punching bags.    These reforms, though clearly logical, will not hold owing to the Greek peoples being fully justified in crucifying their "representatives."  They will be back in the same mess in another election cycle, or sooner.   The best thing that could happen for Greece is that they get completely roiled and have a constitutional crisis, and subsequently eject the ["reinforced" proportional representation system with its "constituency voting."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Greece)  Transferring the mandate of the voters in each constituency directly to the candidates instead of the party bosses would not allow for this past weekend's snub.  Any system in which legislators can be ejected for not voting right is flawed.
-	-	The writer is talking to the air. The difference between Greece and Germany is a competent government and a tax-loyal populace.
-	-	Germany might be overwhelmed by such measures, but they also have 0 need for them.  The Germans have spent all the time since the end of WWII positioning themselves as an economic power-center rooted in manufacturing and exports, and they've succeeded.  They are doing well in the midst of the recession because they payed off their debts while spending money on social programs wisely.  Conversely, the Greeks sat around being corrupt, incompetent, arrogant, lazy, and loud.
-	-	Honestly, although this sucks for the Greeks, this is the correct response to get out of the debt.
-	-	Except that they are still going to have to default, the Greek people will just be on the hook for a whole lot more.
1	4	Luckily for Germans paying taxes is actually the norm rather than a strange exception and they don't retire at 55. So it seems like they should get to enjoy social benefits, and other goodies in return? Am I crazy?
-	-	Maybe, but this is the only real option they have.
-	-	the average retirement age in greece is 60, in germany it's 62
-	-	You are seriously wrong, here. If they defaulted right now, they would do it with a far less damaging recovery ahead of them. By selling of public enterprises, they are only making the final crash 10x worse.

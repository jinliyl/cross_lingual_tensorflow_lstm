0	1	Oh look, it's apparatchik. When not posting conspiracy theories about those awful Joos, apparatchik likes to spend his time on Reddit defending backward Islamists. Probably a hypocritical Muslim or a typical run-of-the-mill Reddit Islamophile. Here's a thought; how about you fuck off to some stone age Muslim state, where they hang homosexuals and treat women like cattle? 
1	4	I like this game where we invent meanings for words that have no basis in fact or basis in history.  Is Zionism the new Fascism, a word so weighed down by negativity that no one bothers to actually consider its real meaning before using it as a byword for all that is evil and terrible?  I'll give you a hint -- Zionism is a 19th century *secular* movement based on economic theories of mutualism. The focus on the creation of a Jewish state had nothing to do with religious beliefs -- the founder of Zionism, Theodor Herzl, was not a religious Jew. Instead, the motivation for the establishment of a Jewish state had to do with his belief that Jews would never be accepted by the predominantly non-Jewish European countries that hosted them. Two formative experiences led him to this conclusion: the first was his participation in a German nationalist movement, where he experienced antisemitism, and the second was the Dreyfus affair, which happened when he was in Paris.  Very few Jews agreed with his position and Zionism remained a fringe movement until after the Holocaust, when the European Jewry came to agree with Herzl's assessment that not feeling particularly Jewish yourself does not protect bigots from discriminating against you for your anscestry.  In fact, much of the *opposition* to Zionism in the 19th century came from religious Jews, who, in keeping with orthodox Jewish tradition, maintained that Jews should not return to the holy land before the coming of the Messiah, who had not yet arrived. There are some very religious Jews that still hold this position.  Particularly by 19th century standards, the "Father of Zionism" wasn't much of a Jew: he spoke neither Hebrew nor Yiddish, he did not receive an official Bar Mitzvah, and his motivations for the creation of a Jewish state were explicitly secular.  The choice of Palestine as a Jewish homeland was somewhat arbitrary and mainly for cultural continuity -- in his seminal work, *der Judenstaat*, in which he outlines his plans for a Jewish state, he explicitly names Argentina as a possible candidate. The benefits of Palestine had mainly to do with its proximity to Europe and its importance in Jewish history. Herzl also saw an economic angle: the Ottoman Empire was in debt and he believed he might be able to convince the Ottoman Sultan to allow the Jews to create a homeland in Palestine in exchange for them taking on the Ottoman Empire's foreign debt. To this end he actually met with members of the Ottoman court, including the Sultan, to pitch this plan. It was rejected.  What Israel does today is not in any way defensible but stop claiming that Zionism is about religion. It's not. Not today, and not ever.  I really can't stand people who don't bother to do a little reading.

-	-	one example please for disappearing posts
-	-	It's far from "decent" check my post right above you.
-	-	Yes some guy hired a professional actor and got the intern of the PM to spread it around. According to the government, it is Hamas. 
1	8	&gt;The focus on the creation of a Jewish state had nothing to do with religious beliefs  What?  I agree that many Zionists and their supporters are secular but to claim that religion has nothing to do to with Zionism in the past or present is disingenuous.  For example, we have many American evangelicals Zionists supporting the state of Israel solely because they believe it will fulfill some sort of biblical prophecy.  Many settlements in the West Bank are occupied by Jewish fanatics who believe that God promised them that land.   &gt;The choice of Palestine as a Jewish homeland was somewhat arbitrary and mainly for cultural continuity  Sorry I don't buy it.  We have a ton of Israeli apologists here claiming that they have more of a right to live in Palestine than Arabs.  Why?  Because their holy book says so.  You are manipulating historical facts to fit your own version of Zionism.    
-	-	Are you a thief too?
0	1	I'm not Jewish, you Islamophile fuck. OMG THOSE POOR MUSLIMS WHY CANT PEOPLE JUST LET THEM BLOW THEMSELVES UP IN CAFES IN PEACE? Fuck off you leftist piece of shit.
1	4	Wow, really?  Netanyahu's *really* reaching on that one.
1	4	&gt;You are manipulating historical facts to fit your own version of Zionism.  No, I don't have "my own version" of Zionism, because I'm not a Zionist. I've just actually bothered to read something about Zionism, as you apparently have not.  I couldn't care less what Evangelical Americans call themselves or think Zionism is about. I also couldn't care less about the religious motivations of crazy settlers. That these people exist and are bad is not in question, but making them representative of Zionism is like calling Stalin a fascist.
-	-	I thought it was just some guy who made it?
-	-	The word Zionism originates in Herzel's works. Herzel was a secular, non-believer Jew.  Zionism has non-religious roots.  It means "aspiration for homeland for Jews", and is not about a "holy land".  The main Zionist variants wanted this homeland to be in the Jewish people's historical homeland, but other Zionists wanted it to be in Uganda or elsewhere.  Jews could not assimilate around the world -- and after witnessing that, they decided they have no choice but to immigrate to their own homeland.  Palestine was not empty, but nowhere was empty, and they wanted to co-exist peacefully with the people already there. Until the British came to rule, they had peaceful relations. When the British came to rule, they had the British's acceptance of their plans.
-	-	Because Goebbels is by far the most visible offender, historically speaking.
-	-	**WHAT!?!?!**
-	-	"propaganda" is thought control, and that's exactly what the israeli government tried to do in the case of the flotilla.  also, the word "propaganda" isn't necessarily a reference to events leading to the nazi holocaust (or nazism itself). propaganda always meant "creating awareness" (or something close) before nazi propaganda was exposed after the second world war, after which it's been used as a disparaging remark.
-	-	If many Israelis are as indoctrinated and faithful to Zionism as lolrsk8s there is a huge problem among Jews.
-	-	Making cynical use of gay rights to tarnish human rights activists to try to link them to Hamas *is a big deal*. It just shows you how low will Israel go to keep its apartheid State and to keep its illegal blockade of the Gaza Ghetto.
-	-	Not really, the Telegraph is a very very pro-Palestinian Newspaper. After the Guardian they are easily the most sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, even more so than the BBC.   About 8 months ago they did an amazing piece of writing over 6 broadsheet pages or so that covered the entire history of Israel from the 1930s to up until the 90s. It was incredibly informative and non-bias covering the atrocities caused by all three sides in the early conflict.
-	-	no, Zionism is the belief that the Holy Land belongs to Jews exclusively because "God promised them", therefore a bunch of European colonial settlers who claim ancestry from 2000 years ago have a "right to the land" which translates to a right to ethnically cleanse all non-Jewish populations, something they have been doing for 63 years now, sometimes through war, sometimes through administrative means imposed at the barrel of a gun. 
-	-	Israel is built on stolen Arab land. First stealth was administrated by the Brits and UN and then further by Israel itself by conquest.   Are you a Thief? 
-	-	well it is.. it doesn't have to be state sponsored or endorsed. It's an usurping of the truth to further an ideal... somewhat nefarious if a little cliche. I don't think it has to be sensational to be propaganda... most propaganda is denialist in nature in any case.
-	-	They are claiming they didnt produce it. Instead they said Hamas produced it. LOL
-	-	sure thing buddy, keep believing that ;)
-	-	according to the government the video was produced by hamas to embarrass the government, therefore Omar is working for Hamas. 
1	6	Why did you change your name from glengyron?
0	1	I am usually of the 'fuck Israel' mindset (still am actually) but I have to admit, this shit happens in every thread on a similar topic. Generally I might not mind but when it is accompanied by the smug, self righteousness found on reddit, it starts to become jarring.  The more I visit this place, the more I realise most of the posters are really no different than the Fox news viewers they claim to despise so much. The only difference between the two groups is that one says 'fuck you, I don't like (insert group here) and I don't care what you think'. While the other group tries to intellectually rationalise their ignorance and bigotry. (This works very well on reddit, as they are always up-voted by like minded idiots, while any argument is down-voted in the same way).
-	-	He is an actor looking for his 15 minutes of fame.   Besides that, in the modern world, you are innocent until proven to be part of a crazy conspiracy theory.  The onus of providing a source that he is connected to the government is on you.  until then, we should assume he isnt. 
-	-	Zionism is the belief that Israel should have a right to exist.  Are you not a Zionist?
-	-	Attempted pinkwashing going ridiculous lengths.....
-	-	Joseph Goebbels would be proud to see his legacy carried on so faithfully.
-	-	And this thread will of course not even get a tenth of the points as the original.
-	-	Now the Israelis are going for the "fake gay activist" trend? They're about a month behind, I must say.
-	-	The government intern who first promoted this is named Guy Seeman.
1	4	That editorialized headline is a mouthful and a lot of people like to upvote stories without reading the articles (not just a reddit problem of course).   Basically, the article says a blogger pretending to be kicked off the flotilla was exposed as a phony. Some *intern* who worked (for money?) for the government liked the video and posted it on his twitter. And the government website (unnamed, no link) supposedly gave a link to this fake gay guy's blog.  When the Government found out that it was a hoax, they took it down like any grown up organization would do and apoligized for being tricked. When anti-Israel groups found out it was a hoax, they crucified Israel for not having 20-20 hindsight when some intern posted some inconsequential shit on a twitter account. So who's blowing things out of proportion. How is this a big deal?  **TLDR** read the article it's not that big a deal.
1	6	I'm not surprised. Hasbara overdrive !
1	6	Quite surprised to see this in the UK's conservative house magazine the Torygraph.    
-	-	I predict: once this post reaches the front page, the Israel Apologists Gangs will swarm and the post will "magically disappear" - I have seen it many times before.
-	-	So, the overwhelming all-pervasive Israeli propaganda turns out to be a transparent hoax?
0	5	[The Arabs stole it from the Crusaders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Jerusalem).  The Crusaders stole it from the etc. etc. ad infinitum.
-	-	RTFA.  Apparently the government posted it to their internet presence but did not, to anyone's knowledge, commission the fake in the first place.  Dumbasses.
-	-	Thinking about it 15 or 20 years ago the then editor of the paper, Max Hastings, had some sort of epiphany and changed tone.....I'll see what I can find. I think I remember an interview.  Edit: [Here it is.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/may/09/israel-middle-east-max-hastings)
-	-	They new it was a hoax from day one. They took it off the moment they realized everyone else knew it was a hoax. 
-	-	I for one, welcome our Jewbot overlords.  
1	6	Why do we immediately turn to Goebbels when we think of Propaganda? It was a Jew, Edward Bernays, who wrote the bible on the subject (literally titled "Propaganda", 1922). The psychological manipulation of the masses came from the people who mastered psychology. Goebbels was just a copycat hack.
-	-	that wasnt sponsored by the government...
-	-	Top comment is Nazi/Holocaust reference oh and look were on a thread about Israel.  You never disappoint me reddit.  Also there's no evidence that the Israeli government actually orchestrated this, but cool story bros.
1	4	Indeed. This hoax makes *Der Ewige Jude* look like a romantic comedy.
-	-	are you serious with this whole pinkwashing thing? is it so bad to have one democracy in the middle east where you can be gay openly and not killed instantly? 
1	6	on not really. For example the Daily Mail is not a nationalised institution in the UK yet it is responsible for a significant proportion of the nationalist propaganda in the UK. The norm also should be for government to not endorse hoaxes.. what you think they deserve a cookie and a glass of milk for this? What credible government endorses hoaxes? The quality of this submission is a separate issue.
1	6	The video was very professionally made, using an actor. It wouldn't surprise me if it was government funded in some way.
-	-	Original being... the video of the guy claiming he was banned from participating in the flotilla?
-	-	&gt; supposedly  Are you blind? I think it is you who is editorialising, the article clearly stated that it was posted on government websites and that the government apologised for being "duped".  How is this a big deal? Do you know the history of these countries, the expression that the flotilla stands for (an expression of international condemnation). Israel jumped at the chance to spread this video to discredit the flotilla, they didn't *care* if it was fake or not. The video was actually made by Israeli Israeli activist.  How do you not understand the importance of what this story is telling? It's not that big of a deal that Israel did this? Could you imagine the international reaction if the USA did this, or China, or France, or ANY other legitimate country?
-	-	um.. it's a deal... not a big one sure but the nature of news this days is that the majority of content is only luke warm.. it's of note. Who's blowing it out of proportion?
-	-	Did you read this story? A hoax to make pro-Palestinian movements seen unfriendly to queers? if that's not pinkwashing then what is it?  And, in general, Israel's decent treatment of queers does not excuse or justify its behaviour in other areas, and I wish people would stop trying to make this point.
-	-	source?
-	-	whether or not it is state sponsored is a big deal. The fact that it was taken off the government website (no link to the website on the Telegraph) the moment the government found it was a certifiable hoax indicates that the government is not endorsing hoaxes.  And Again, what concerns me, is the article doesn't link to an actual gov't website or even give the name of the site. There's no excuse for that laziness nowadays.
1	4	Omar could have been doing it himself, or he could have been funded.  I don't know.  I would like to know.  Who is going to check his bank records?
-	-	Yes. If reddit's search was better I might even have found it.
-	-	Except this was pinkwashing.
-	-	Bad news if you are a child in Gaza though. They get murdered by the hundred. So - sex between men is ok, but voting the wrong way, or being a child from the wrong ethnic group is not. Theres a reason Israel is the only democracy in the ME, and you only need to look what theyve done to Gaza to work out why.
1	6	Conquer of lands goes back 2000 years. The land swapped hands 17 times. Why is the second-last time the determining time?  The "theft" to which you refer happened in 1880-1948.  In 2011 it is as relevant as the "theft" of the land from the Jews 2000 years ago.  Do you think Israel should cease to exist?
-	-	Reddit as usual, the title says it's propaganda exposed.
0	2	&gt;is it so bad to have one democracy in the middle east where you can be gay openly and not killed instantly?  Ah, the popular ["Tu quoque"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque) argument, this is a logical fallacy.  FALSE  It is an intentional tactic of Israeli government itself to highlight gay rights in Israel and to portray it as a utopia for homosexuals in contrast with a portrayal of the Arab states as being backwards and discriminatory. They leave out the violence against the gay community and gay parades in Israel. Basically Israel is using homosexuals as a political football to try to score human rights brownie points since it's impossible to do that via the central conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.  Is Israel Using Gay Rights to Excuse Its Policy on Palestine?  &gt;"The accusations stem from efforts over the past half-decade by the Israeli government to weave the country's gay-friendly policies - including national hate-crime laws, employment protection for LGBT workers and openly gay military service - into its larger national-rebranding strategy, in the hopes of redirecting its global image away from politics, terrorism and the occupied territories." Is Israel Using Gay Rights to Excuse Its Policy on Palestine? - By DAVID KAUFMAN, Time Magazine  ---- &gt;is it so bad to have one democracy in the middle east where you can be gay openly and not killed instantly?  Your claims are completely false, and fabricated.

Therefore your claim- which specifically says it can't happen anywhere in the middle east is 100% false.  And really things aren't that different in Israel than in the Arab World - there was a terror attack against the gay rights center in Tel Aviv which "mysteriously" has never been solved. And virtually every year there are threats against the Israeli pride parades. And violence.  &gt;"A religious Jew stabbed three people during clashes between dozens of ultra-Orthodox Jews and thousands of Gay Pride Parade marchers in central Jerusalem Thursday."

The violence came after the city's ultra-Orthodox mayor had tried to ban the march but was overruled in court. The following year, police ordered 12,000 officers to protect a few hundred marchers from possible ultra-Orthodox violence." Gay vs. Orthodox: A Deadly Turn in Israel's Culture War?   **There are no laws against homosexuality in Jordan for 50 years - long before it became legal in Israel - long before it became legal in most Western countries, in fact.**  In practice, in Israel, tolerance of homosexuality declines precipitously once one leaves Tel Aviv. Its much like Lebanon in that regard.  The differences in countries laws against homosexuality has less to do with inherent qualities of Jews vs. Arabs - after all the Jewish religion calls for death by stoning of gays - but instead has more to do with the colonial history:  &gt;“What’s interesting is that the Arab areas that were once controlled by the French, like Lebanon, are the ones with laws against homosexuality, because the French felt comfortable talking about sex,” Mr. Luongo said, “while the areas controlled by the British didn’t have those laws because they didn’t talk about sex. As a result, flowing from that French history is a relative familiarity with homosexuality in places like Lebanon. You have more gay life where the laws exist against it.”  http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/travel/02gaybeirut.html   This argument that claims that Israel is the only "safe haven" for gays in the middle east used way too much to pander to Western audience's hearts.  &gt;"The accusations stem from efforts over the past half-decade by the Israeli government to weave the country's gay-friendly policies — including national hate-crime laws, employment protection for LGBT workers and openly gay military service — into its larger national-rebranding strategy, in the hopes of redirecting its global image away from politics, terrorism and the occupied territories."  http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2070415,00.html  &gt;"Israel has begun an aggressive public relations campaign to market itself as an oasis of gay tolerance and democracy in the Mideast, surrounded by “backward” countries where gays have no rights. The campaign is not about supporting queers in Palestine or elsewhere in the Mideast who are resisting homophobia. It is about using their experience of homophobia to promote hatred of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims – including queer Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims. The campaign is designed to make people living in liberal democracies like Canada feel an affinity for Israel. The implication is that Israel needs to practice apartheid, colonialism, and violence in order to preserve the liberal freedoms it enjoys. It might be unpleasant, but surely we can understand the exceptional circumstances?"  http://queersagainstapartheid.org/gayisrael/

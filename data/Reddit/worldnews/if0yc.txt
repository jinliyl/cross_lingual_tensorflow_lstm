1	4	Seriously.  Being single was like being in prison.  Health &amp; Welfare inspections are awesome! 
-	-	The article says that they were girlfriends and doesn't specify if they were life partners. A heterosexual marine dating someone wouldn't get those benefits either.
-	-	Yeah, it is a crime under the UCMJ.
-	-	Right. UCMJ says adultery is engaging in sexual conduct with a married person.
-	-	wh...oh wait, by the military, not by the US citizen laws, right?
1	4	I understand their position, but they did violate the UCMJ and they got caught. The Corps cannot ignore that and choose not to charge them because their actions might be understandable.  However, if the "selling" of benefits is a rampant practice amongst members of the service and not actively investigated and prosecuted, one could certainly make the argument that this prosecution is selective enforcement. In the civilian system, that might get a case thrown out. How that works in the military I'm unsure of.  Their real mistake was both of them marrying Marines. It seems like it went from skirting regulations to outright fraud when it became both.
1	4	one of the reasons I got out...  ...singles get treated like shit.  There was so much incentive to shack up that there's literally a cottage industry that revolves around marrying service members to split the benefits.
-	-	It's stupid for the military to offer BAH to married personnel and force single personnel to reside in on post housing.  I saw a great deal of military folks enter bad marriages simply because married personnel get treated better and get paid more than the single ones.
-	-	&gt;charged with...adultery  wait, really?
-	-	I don't really think this is news.  Maybe for CNN I guess.  People have been doing this for a long time.
1	4	Two of my good friends married to get the benefits. Him the extra income and for her the medical. 
-	-	They wanted the same benefits that a heterosexual couple would receive.    Seems fair.
-	-	So in the lesbian couple was one of them supporting the both of them?

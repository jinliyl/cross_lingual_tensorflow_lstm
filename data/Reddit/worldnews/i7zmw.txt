1	6	I'm suspicious who/why anyone would downvote your post.  It's laughable what they are calling "genetic modification" when anyone without bias would simply call it high quality.

1	4	No, genetic modification refers to inserting foreign DNA (to express very specific proteins) into the genome.  Best example, Round Up Ready corn and soybeans.  edit: Larger, more healthy plants that yield more are typically F1 hybrids, a product from heterosis (aka hybrid vigor).

0	1	Yea, why the fuck is the media reporting good news as bad news
0	1	Importing it is kind of a bitch.
-	-	Yeah, they should be focusing on coca.
-	-	but it's 10 times the normal price! 
1	6	Yeah that's a little weird, it's definitely hilarious to call it 'genetic modification'....is it a Monsanto downboat crew? O_o
1	6	The wrong part is mistaking selective breeding and GM.
0	2	What a load of horse shit. Regular everyday marijuana can be 18-20% thc. There's no genetic modification going on to get that, they're just now getting the modern seeds everyone else has had for ages and growing it instead of their native, lower potency varieties. 
0	2	It's selectively bred, not genetically modified, and it's been like that for 25 years. Pretty sloppy reporting. 
-	-	At any rate, more powerful weed is a "problem"?   NOPE.
-	-	the real problem with **selectively breeding** for high thc content is that they are losing other cannabinoids in the process.  the average smoker just wants high thc content, but the other cannabinoids can be medicinally helpful if consumed through an oil extract.  http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/2/1/17  &gt;As evolution proceeded, the role that the cannabinoid system played in animal life continuously increased. It is now known that this system maintains homeostasis within and across the organizational scales of all animals. Within a cell, cannabinoids control basic metabolic processes such as glucose metabolism [17]. Cannabinoids regulate intercellular communication, especially in the immune [18] and nervous systems [19]. In general, cannabinoids modulate and coordinate tissues, organ and body systems (including the cardiovascular [20], digestive [16], endocrine [21], excretory [22,23], immune [18], musculo-skeletal [24], nervous [19], reproductive [25], and respiratory [26] systems).  &gt;The homeostatic action of cannabinoids on so many physiological structures and processes is the basis for the hypothesis that the endocannabinoid system is nothing less than a naturally evolved harm reduction system. Endocannabinoids protect by fine-tuning and regulating dynamic biochemical steady states within the ranges required for healthy biological function. The endocannabinoid system itself appears to be up- or down-regulated as a function of need. As will be detailed later in this article, endocannabinoid levels naturally increase in the case of head injury and stroke [28], and the number of cannabinoid receptors increases in response to nerve injury and the associated pain [29]. In contrast, the number of cannabinoid receptors is reduced when tolerance to cannabinoids is induced [30].

-	-	Downvoted for poor study and incorrect term for GM. They are not genetically modified, they are selective bred. Also as a scare tactic.
1	4	It would be interesting to see actual gm weed, one that needs less light and has a shorter growth cycle would be far more interesting then ever more potent bud
0	2	$54 per kilo?  What a shitty market for the sellers.  
-	-	Problem?   
-	-	11 kilos of super weed for $87... where do I sign up?
0	1	oh boy, Dro from Amsterdam in California got to Colombia big whoop. Its just cheap as fuck
-	-	&gt;One resident who spoke on the condition of anonymity said he can sell 11 kilograms of marijuana for 160,000 Colombian pesos ($87).  11 kilos is 388 ounces.  Of the (388 oz * 8 * $50 per eighth) $155,000 it fetches on the street, $87 goes to the man who grows it.  End.  Prohibition.  Now.
-	-	TIL you can buy a kilo of weed for $5.40
0	1	And this is coming from a science oriented publication. Shame.
1	6	LOL at Genetically Modified -this isn't franken-weed - it's selective breeding.  It's not like Monsanto is genetically fucking with weed and putting roundup in it to prevent bugs from getting to the plants - they're doing that in the food we EAT!
-	-	Attaching the GM stigma to cannabis in a "science publication" is yellow journalism. Also false: "Marijuana was first introduced to the country in the 1930s". Cannabis is endemic in colombia. Maybe I should say "was endemic" after the USG poisoned the rainforest with fumigation campaigns.
1	8	Yet another "super-pot" scare. Ooooo. It's a *powerful* drug now!  Here is the probable writer's twitter account: https://twitter.com/#!/luisrobayo  Let him know he is enabling the Drug Warriors.
0	2	yeah i was like wtf!? a bunch of lies.
-	-	Probably stoned when they wrote the article.
-	-	Most medical patients aren't smoking Columbian weed.
-	-	Couldn't selective breeding be considered a form genetic modication?  You're still controlling which genes are passed on through human intervention, and not through natural selection.  Sure you don't have full control, but that fact that they are stronger, better, or more healthy is still a result of direct and deliberate human intervention.

1	4	touche 
-	-	&gt;It results in a wider variety of phenos and doesn't really mean they are generally more healthy or will yield more.   In plant breeding, hybrids are typically produced by making a cross between two IBLs (in-bred lines, homozygous) and the F1 generation is uniform, and gain benefit from hybrid vigor/heterosis.  [F1 information here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_hybrid)  [Heterosis information here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosis)   Let's make a hybrid test cross (assuming complete dominance).  BB for black, and bb for white.  When you set up the cross, it looks like BB x bb.  As a result, the gametes are different than their parents with the genotype of Bb, but their phenotype is still black.  I cannot explain why plants experience heterosis.
-	-	two words: klebsiella planticola  this is why selective breeding is better than GM.
1	8	Ah. I took Spaceman's comment in the wrong context then. (this is what I get for hanging around ultra-cons who believe that legalizing marijuana will give "the working class an excuse to blah blah..." *sigh*)

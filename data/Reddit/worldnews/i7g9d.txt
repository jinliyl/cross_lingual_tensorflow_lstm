0	2	You don't think that a country rife with militant jihadists will praise a man who attempted to murder someone for slandering Muhammad?  It's happened already with some returnees from Guantanamo, as well as the guy who planned the Pan Am 103 bombing.  
1	4	Excellent. That's actually an _extremely_ harsh sentence by scandinavian standards, which shows the danes take this seriously. 
1	4	oh, i get it, because somalia is that country where people are always shooting one another.  Oh, it's fun to make fun of them!
-	-	No one uses Texas and America interchangeably.
-	-	No you're right. Ten years is a hard sentence in DK. But not that uncommon. Maybe eight years is given more often. But still. Ten is fair In this case. 16 would be fair aswell. Deported after eight. 
0	1	Is it possible to stay there for over 16 years? Like if there is a good chance of the person repeating the crime.
-	-	You know a lot about religion for a Black Magic Ben
0	8	If you're referring to kubrick's version then, yes, that's blasphemy.
-	-	Absurd logics. Holland is the official name for Holland/The Netherlands in many countries' languages. I've met plenty of Dutch people, but never anyone who minded. Btw, America isn't a country, do you mean the USA?
1	4	Well Im from Denmark, but I was speaking generally. But it seems like it only goes one way the French doesn't have that many words that look English or Danish, the same go for the Germans.   Though it have changed a lot the last fifty years, where new English words is more common PC or Computer are good examples even though they have their own words for it too. But our words and language is very much depended on where we get our cultural impact from. 
-	-	Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, German, Dutch and partly English where all basically the same language about 1500-2000 years ago. The reason Dutch sounds like Afrikaans is because Afrikaans is a mix of Dutch, English and local dialects in south africa due to colonization a few hundred years back.
-	-	As someone who speaks both German, Swedish and Danish I'd say Danish sounds a lot more like German, SOUNDS that is, while the language of course is much more similar to Swedish.
-	-	What country are you refering to? If England, the French became standard in the higher classes after the Invasion by William the Conqueror, while it did over time go back to English, the English language did get a large influence from the French. A perfect example is Pork which comes from the French while Swine come from anglo-saxon/Norse.
0	2	Not everyone in Denmark are violent douchebags though.
-	-	I know his wife has contact with him, but they moved away from aalborg. Since everyone started to treat her and the kids(small children) horribly. My mom occasionally talks to his mother-in-law. 
1	8	But Holland is a region of The Netherlands. Texas and the US are popularly interchangeable; doesn't make it any more correct.   EDIT: Ok, maybe a better example is that America and the US are used interchangeably.
0	1	you're a fucking idiot.
-	-	He'll be hailed. With bullets.
	If you can't see the difference between fox news and reddit you have more serious problems.
-	-	&gt;&gt;there's no doubt that this is a very, very strong-minded individual. (a strong mind being one that is resistant to change).  I don't know where you got that picture of the people who does these things, but it seems to be the opposite of the description that western intelligence bureaus gives. These people are misfits in society. They lack direction and purpose. They are people who are easily changed.  &gt;&gt;an individual who probably came and settled in Scandinavia with sabotage firmly in mind  There is nothing that points toward this being the case. It looks like he got to Denmark and didn't fit in for various reasons, then travelled to Somalia and got the plan there, long after he was settled in Denmark. 
0	3	This has been going on in quite a few threads.
-	-	[deleted]
0	2	Left arms are typically worthless.
-	-	I think his point is just that Fox news has a history of strong-bias and inaccuracies so why not link to someone who has a better record? For example, someone once posted a Fox article that claimed ipv4 was named that way because it has 4 digits ( [they've since edited the article](http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/01/26/internet-run-ip-addresses-happens-anyones-guess/) )..if they get facts like that wrong, why should we keep trying to trust them? Why not an actual news site so that when I read "10 years" I don't have to wonder if they're correct. 
-	-	Guess who forced him for that. He didn't made it built because of his own danish citizens.
1	8	It's called selective reporting, Jesus people, use your heads...
-	-	[deleted]
0	3	I still think it's silly to charge someone for 'terrorism', especially in cases where it makes more sense to charge them for old-fashioned crimes like in this case breaking and entering, threatening with a deadly weapon, violence against a police officer and attempted murder.
0	3	On the other hand, the terrible conditions in US prisons basically set the inmates up to re-offend later.  Even if there is a Playstation, having your freedom taken away is still a serious punishment.  We don't need to torture people - we need to remove the causes of crime.
0	5	Also a much more homogenous population, for now. We'll see how you deal with non-white diversity in the coming decades, as the Muslims continue to poor in. It doesn't look good so far though, does it? Ask the French
0	2	Are you saying that Somali refugee did not try to kill a danish man over a fucking cartoon? Has Foxnews somehow lied in this particular instance?   Explain.
0	1	He didn't piss of 'his own danish citizens.' He did, however piss of some nutcase muslims. And he did that knowing what could happen.  This was not about freedom of speech, people who argue that are very ignorant to the fact that freedom of speech does not exist over nation borders, it's not some universal right.  No, the cartoons was one mans idea of profiting from a certain situation. I say, go ahead and profit, good for you if you pull it of, but don't come whining when shit like this happen.
-	-	If it wasn't for the fact it happens time and time again I'd agree with you.  And don't tell me you wouldn't act the same way.
-	-	Because they supported this Dutchman?
-	-	That doesn't change the fact that this guy tried to **kill someone for drawing a cartoon**.  And he only got 10 years.  Fox News and the internet can be full of people making outrageous comments to get attention.  Racism still exists, and some countries can be xenophobic despite being a 'liberal, social democratic' society.  Ce la vie.
0	1	"Black people are still called Nigger, and they are so proud of it they won't call you black, but prefer that term. See to them, it doesn't matter that the term is insulting, what matters is what they think the term means, so they keep using it and to hell with if other people get upset."  Where in the world do you get this from sir? Yes, some people here are racists - just as some are in every country in the world. The term Nigger is most often seen upon as a soft swear word here (in Denmark), and it's mostly old people who use the term, as that's what they grew up with and they are stubborn. It saddens me to read that you have had a bad experience here, but of course it depends on the place you've been and the people you've met. Some people do fear foreign people here, with the reason usualy being the fear of terrorist or the media's role in highlighting foreigners crimes. 
-	-	Look, I'm somali myself. I grew up in Denmark, and racism really isn't that common. I really don't like Sklan's comments, but hey. That's his right to do so. Denmark is great country to live in, but they have their issues like most other countries.   And look I know the guy, I'm related to his wife, while everything that happend came as shock, the sentence really doesn't.  
-	-	Cease, not seize.
-	-	Understanding of undocumented immigrant routes from Africa through Turkey and into the EU via Bulgaria much?
0	1	That is because it is filled with Somalians. 
0	2	Christianity deserves all the same criticisms that Islam does.
0	2	I know. It is fucking annoying to get people like you described, in my community. But I guess a lot of nationalities struggle with this. It's human to not like a people only because of a few bad encounters. We only remember the bad things that happened to us, say, yesterday.   Thanks for the kind words. You happen to be Fnnish?
1	8	Yeah, my previous comment seemed like trying to sound "deep" for some moron maybe...  I am trying to explain that someone might perceive comic of their holy figure as not trivial matter. And people knew that so why are you acting like its some surprise... 
-	-	it worked a little too well for me i guess. i can't seem to learn any other language now without reverting back to german!
1	4	agreed and agreed. time to end irrelevant discussion before we get downvoted to hell.
0	2	Well it's not like they can worsen your death penalty.
1	7	I understand. You are a good person. I mean that. 
-	-	surah 9.
0	2	There may be a lot of them, but there are a lot of fucked up things happening because of islam and a lot of people perpetrate these acts or fail to condemn them with enough force. I know it's cool to support the underdog and whatnot but jsut open your eyes, the world does not prosper where islam prevails.
0	2	shit..sorry
1	7	Unless they capped the article with "and it was all Obamas fault," I'm not sure what about this doesn't qualify as news in your eyes.
-	-	Meh - when he got death threaths, the police supplied him with a reinforced door for the bathroom. It's not even a proper panic room  Besides, his right arm was broken and in a sling when the attacker came, so he wouldn't have had much use of a gun, anyway.
0	1	Anyone willing to kill someone else for religion should be locked away for life or deported into space.
1	4	That's actually a good question. It's the intention and attempt that really matters in a legal sense as far as I'm concerned, not the outcome of the attempt.      Same for every crime, really. Attempted robbery should have the same sentence as succeeded robbery.
0	1	Terrorism is to spread terror in a population.  Isn't it terror, to vow you will kill anyone who draws a specifik cartoon? It is terror when you try to inhibit people through their feir for you.
0	2	&gt; It's just a nut trying to kill someone with a religious motivation  That's a beautiful summary of fundamentalist terrorism.
-	-	Depends on the country. In Denmark our "death" sentence is 16 years.. and afaik you get TV and playstation and all sorts of crap in your cell..many criminals joke that Danish prison is nothing but vacation &gt;_&lt;
0	1	You dont really know shit about Scandinavian prison sentences do you? 10 years is a harsh sentence around here.
-	-	Oh? So what a small fraction does, suddenly reflects on the whole? 
-	-	And yet we have lower crime rates than the US and cherish a ban on capital punishment as a basic right. Funny how that works. 
-	-	[deleted]
0	1	Fuck Fox News. Showing the logo itself is a much bigger crime. Downvoted you brainwashed peon. 
0	1	DOWNVOTED for linking to Fox News.  Next time, please try to find an article on an actual fucking news site, not a propaganda machine.  Thank you.  FYI - iluvpi linked to an alternate source, in another comment, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i7g9d/somali_man_who_tried_to_kill_the_danish/c21i4iz).

0	2	Is European justice a joke or something? Premeditated murder gets like 5 years right?
0	1	Just more proof to show how worthless muslims are to society.  Sigh.  
0	2	FOX News is DYING for us to start thinking of Muslims as extremists again.  They also want to associate hackers with "terrorists":  http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/06/23/hacker-vs-hacker-group-races-police-to-expose-lulzsec/  Fuck FOX.  Bunch of propaganda...
-	-	Danish prison is like coming to heaven for a Somalian.
0	2	Just 10 yeas? I wish he would've robbed $100 from a US bank afterwards :(
0	3	People in Europe have panic rooms.  People in US have panic armories. 
-	-	Is Somalian a race now? Is is racist to complain about Americans?
0	1	It's not politically incorrect, it's just incorrect, unintelligible bullshit. I'm sure the British had the same thing to say about the Irish in the 18th century, retard. The mistake many racists make is to think people hate them because they are offensive; no, we dislike you because your world view has no scientific basis (race is a social not a genetic construct), just the same way we dislike the creationists.
0	1	Living in Sweden where we got a shitload of somali immigrants as well as quite a few gypsys.
-	-	Actually, that would make a lazy theif high on khat so perhaps not that bad after all.
1	6	I love LastPass, but RES is better for quickly switching reddit accounts. In fact, I think there's an option to select which username to use when posting...?  (I don't have any novelty accounts, so I have all that disabled.)
1	4	Nice try LastPass CEO..
-	-	&gt; Does that shit happen every day though? IRA and ETA are pretty much over, as are the Balkan wars.   So in order to judge religions which has existed for hundreds of hundreds of years you disregard everything that happened more than 30 years ago???  &gt; Yes, the US is killing people in Iraq/Afghanistan but are they doing it in the name of their religion?  Americans seems to think so. Bush said it was a religious war, didn't he? Look what happened to the USA.  God was added to Pledge of Allegiance, The money have 'In god we trust', the USA apparently starts religous wars. Face the bitter truth, USA is now a religious, more specifically christian, country.  &gt; Not exactly sure what you're referring to here  The entire Iraq war? The excuse was WDM:s. Non-existant, the UN proved that before the war. The sentiments in the USA? Lets kill some people because we're angry, we don't give a fuck who, those muslims over there will do. Citizens in the USA in general had no reasons to go to war with Iraq, but still the entire country mobilized and the hatred started.  Look, I know this sounds like a big fat USA bashing, and it kind of is. But my point is that anyone anywhere can act like an asshole now and then and I do not see any proofs that muslims are worse than any other large group of people.
-	-	I don't know what you've been reading. Nowhere have I threatened anyone, nowhere have I validated any actions action, nowhere do I express anything that can remotely be considered an ideology.  &gt; I wasn't talking about killing anyone, it's the disposal of an ideology which you seem to hold on to.  Now you're lying. This is what you said: "Well you prove yourself to be the very fucking scumbag this world needs to dispose of.". That does not have anything to do with disposal of some fictional ideology that I in your mind apparently hold on to.  &gt; As to revealing your true nature you're interested in the names I call rather than the main idea of the argument which is you can not bow your head to threats and live by the rules of a delusional mad man.  You don't have a main idea, you haven't argued for any, in fact you haven't had any arguments for anything. You haven't expressed an idea, you haven't argued for any main idea, you did not say anything about standing up to threats. That's all in your mind. And if you think otherwise you are wrong.  You have expressed your xenophobic nature, you've attributed me opinions I haven't had, you've grouped me together with other people and ideologies I have nothing to do with and you've lied about what you yourself have said, which is fucking stupid because it's very easy to check your earlier posts.  Feel free to disprove me, but I can't promise I will be bothered to reply, something you can interpret in any way you want.
0	2	Dude, nobody really listens to muslims when they aren't blowing up things: which is kind of problematic. Which thing do you think is the better newspaper article: "twenty muslims kill themselves as suicide bombers!" or "1.2 billion muslims didn't bomb anything at all today!".
1	1	Definitely. What are you on? I meet muslims almost everyday and that is in a christian country.
-	-	especially in Somalia.
-	-	Actually if your coming from poor non-western culture - just being alone is tuff. Isolation in denmark is common - other countries would view it as a very bad thing.
-	-	Tribal infighting never helped any primitive nigger. They just don't learn.
-	-	If by "for centuries" you mean "for most of the period since 1920", then yeah.
-	-	This is how the danish legal system works. Whenever you appeal, and the higher instance of the court comes to the same conclusion as the previous court, the sentence is increased. This is to make people think twice about appealing. and not waste the courts time.
-	-	I don't doubt that one bit. However, I stand by my previous assertion. 
-	-	racist comment is racist.
-	-	racist comment is racist.
0	2	Look, I resent most of the statements here, cause I'm Somali. But the thruth of the matter is, that what you say is bullshit. It's the stupidity of Clan and bloodwar that has driven Somalia into the ditch it's in today.
0	2	That's not true. Somalia tried to start a democracy, which worked for a while, but fell because of clan/tribal loyalties. After that it's been pretty crappy.   And Somalia wasn't abused for "centuries".
-	-	It's true though. What's your problem?
-	-	Ahh yes, the religion of peace.
-	-	He'll be deported. Just try staying out of Somalia.
-	-	__NO THE IRONY IS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WTF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN BOLD TEXT!__  There's fundamentalists fighting in Libya, and the longer the war drags on the more they come to the lead (because they're trained &amp; motivated), but the rebel movement as a whole is not fundamentalist.
0	2	How did the Europeans end up in South Africa? Humans always move if the conditions are favorable.

0	2	Damn straight.
-	-	Offtopic and total BS.
1	5	As a preclude to my response, I would like to say this Libya bullshit you are ranting about has NOTHING to do with the article posted.   Now...Are you being serious?? Lollllll @ Gaddafi being [secular](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Libya#Islam_in_revolutionary_Libya). Listen man, you can hate the west all you want. I may agree that I find the religious positions of the revolution groups dubious. But you shouldn't idealize Gaddafi just because you hate the West. We did, if you remember, stop his army just before they were about to, in all likelihood, massacre a city. You immediately make yourself less serious a voice by idealizing Gaddafi.   edit: first source wouldn't link; resorted to wiki
0	2	Please give us examples of these harmful cartoons which you speak of.
1	7	We live in a certain kind of civilized society. Someone who takes to violence because of some scribbles on paper, no matter how offensive they are, is rightly classed as a savage.

0	2	Fake Germans ouch you'd make a lot of Danes angry with that if you mentioned it to their faces (try it at a bar for a face smashing experience). In Copenhagen replace German with Swedish for the same sort of fun.
-	-	As someone who's mum is Danish, and who has a best friend with Dutch-speaking parents, I really don't see the similarities between the languages.   Danish sounds like Swedish; Dutch sounds like Afrikaans. 
1	8	I've seen college-educated Americans make this mistake before. Feel free to take an informal poll of passersby in a typical American city and see what their interpretation of the phrase "The Netherlands" is.  I have no hard data to support this, but I bet that a substantial proportion, when asked to define The Netherlands, would think it was a blanket term for all of Northern Europe.
-	-	I pray to God he is wrong.
0	3	The man broke into the cartoonist's house with an ax... he said "he was trying to scare him". That's what I do to try to scare people, really gets a good adrenaline rush going.

0	2	*If you moved to saudi arabia*  Hah. I don't think anyone who isn't a rich male arab would ever move there.
0	2	True , I added the immigrant part because i felt someone my say "shut up you racist redneck" or something
1	8	Nobody should, unless it's an article bashing Islam. Then it's perfectly alright. Hilarious how this has a over 60% on here when anything else coming from fox will get downvoted to oblivion on the basis it's a propaganda outlet.
-	-	Actually make hundreds of links to Fox with a note to have adblock running and whatever else to remove advertising. Then give them millions of hits but not one advertisement served so they have the bandwidth bill and no Ad revenue for millions of views.
-	-	Hey, you just found a way to flush out the wingnuts around here!

-	-	This is a news story, though.
0	1	CONTROL F "LINK TO FOX NEWS" -&gt; NOBODY FUCKING CARES YOU MINDLESS ASSHOLE!!
0	2	I don't click on fox news links.
0	2	Yes, because Fox News does not deserve any sort of ad revenue or encouragement through pageviews. It is a cesspool.
0	1	Good...about fucking time!
0	2	That sentence is a joke. That man is a danger to all other men and should not be in society. 
1	6	Why is there a lesser sentence for attempted murder?
0	1	They should lock him up for life and stuff him with pork. Ten years is too little.
0	4	FUN FACT: The uprising that occurred in Libya this past March was supposed to be a commemoration of the violent 2006 protests in Benghazi against the Danish cartoon depictions of Muhammad.  **These religious fundamentalist cartoon protestors are the same "rebels" that NATO currently supports.**  But why would they be protesting against Gaddafi, you ask?  Because Gaddafi himself is a rather secular ruler who wants to open up Libya to become a nation of religious tolerance.  Something else he's been trying to do is nationalize the oil companies operating in Libya in order to keep more of Libyan natural resource wealth for Libyans.  The U.S. and the rest of the western world don't really give a fuck about religious tolerance, but they *do* care about oil.  And so they did what they always do: support a rebellious faction within the country to overthrow its government, in order to eventually replace it with one more amenable to Western causes.  **The irony this time is that the faction that we found to support is actually a bunch of Islamic fundamentalist extremists.  Put another way: if these people lived in Iraq or Afghanistan or even Iran, they would be called al Qaeda.**  But they live in Libya, and more importantly they oppose Gaddafi, and so they are not al Qaeda: they are rebels, or freedom fighters, or whatever euphemism is trendy nowadays.  They fight for peace and democracy and freedom, against a man who in his 40-year reign ~~transformed Libya into one of the most prosperous and egalitarian countries in all of Africa~~ raped and murdered his own people.  **TL;DR:** NATO is currently supporting a Libyan al Qaeda overthrow its secular ruler.  They think they're fighting for Islam; the western world thinks they're fighting for "freedom".  They're really fighting for oil.
0	2	Great, only another 10 years and he'll be ready to cut my head off too.
0	2	i can't believe this sort of cave man shit is still going on. thank you irrational thought and religion.
-	-	The problem with this trial is that they've convicted him of terrorism, even though the case obviously isn't terrorism by any standards. It's just a nut trying to kill someone with a religious motivation, that doesn't make it an act of terror.

0	2	&gt;Are you serious? Ever heard of the IRA, ETA? Who released anthrax in the USA - white extremist group. Remember the Balkan war? The countries killing shit-loads of people in Iraq/Afganistan, which group do they belong to now again?  Does that shit happen every day though? IRA and ETA are pretty much over, as are the Balkan wars.  Yes, the US is killing people in Iraq/Afghanistan but are they doing it in the name of their religion?  &gt; Eh, the entire USA is raging over, for them, non-issues happening in another country they can't even point to on a map.  Not exactly sure what you're referring to here, but there's a big difference between raging over something and *violently* raging over something.
-	-	Of course correlation does not imply causation, where did I ever say that?   My point is that sufficient evidence from samples by necessity leads to certain expectations and assumptions about a whole group. How else can we learn anything or categorize things if we can't extrapolate from a limited number of samples?
1	6	Well, would you say that Muslims in general are doing a good job at showing they are different from the radical Islamists?
-	-	And every redditor I met had some kind of anecdotal evidence. 
-	-	I'm a somali muslim and I live in Finland. There are about 10,000 og us. Is that small enough? Weeks ago there was a bomb-looking device with arabic writin on it left outside a security firm. People were all like 'finally, it happened' and 'it was a matter of time'. They turned out to be a group of anarchists. They wanted to give us a bad name.   Right now I'm going to the mosque. Everytime something like this happens, the imam tells everyone that we do not let individuals make a bad name for all of us. It's OK to think like you think, but it's stupid. 
0	1	&gt;a smaller group should be a near-accurate representation of the larger group  That doesn't work for axe murderers (because they are *really fucking rare*).
1	4	God help us if they start interbreeding.
1	6	And where do you get that from?
0	2	Yeah, he's a terrorist because of his race.
-	-	I'm picking up what you're putting down brother. 
-	-	I couldn't find anything in those articles that supported your idea that Europe have a much more homogeneous population that the USA.  First article: The Netherlands have 16 million citizens and 900000 muslims, then some opinions from people.  Second article: Europe's Muslim population has doubled in the last decade, and an estimated half a million new immigrants -- most of the from Muslim nations -- arrive every year. Nothing more.  Third article: France bans garments that covers your face. People gets upset, others support it.  Fourth article: Compared to the other articles this actually says something. And it says a lot.  What are you trying to say? That this proves that it doesn't look good and that there will be major problems in the future? I'm sorry, but I don't see it. It may or may not lead to huge problems in the future, but the outcome is definitely not given.
-	-	I did not down vote you once.
1	8	lol. Is there some way to make your username distinct each time you post a comment, or do people legit make new accounts every time they want to make a username joke?
0	1	&gt; Well you prove yourself to be the very fucking scumbag this world needs to get disposed of.  And you apparently think killing people is a good way to handle of people who doesn't think like you and express their opinions. Well, that's something you have in common with Muhideen Mohammed Geelle.  &gt; Knowing that some psychopath could stalk you, so you shouldn't do this or do that exactly means bowing your head to these illiterate monkeys fear mongering.  Seems like you are the illiterate since I didn't write that.  On a side note, calling people 'monkeys' reveals that you lack arguments and have to resort to name-calling. You also didn't mention who 'these' refer to, so the sentence makes no sense. Nowhere in your post, or the previous ones, you mentioned a group which 'these' can refer to, unless 'these' means everyone who isn't 'his own danish citizens'. That, however, would make your sentence stupid.
0	2	How is it racist? Surely it's hateful towards Somalians but I see no mention of race.
-	-	It's true though. Somalis are the second worst people on earth, the gypsys takes the first place.
-	-	For several centuries since 1920.
-	-	Stop using logic and just agree that it's the white man's fault.
-	-	actually being able to speak danish made learning german surprisingly easy
-	-	apparently you didnt.
0	1	For bringing axe to someones house and forgetting the keys?  amurica fuck yeah
-	-	refugee ...  Quite common.
-	-	dude, ALL muslims i know--and I know quite a number of muslims--disavow this type of thing.  Do you have any knowledge whatsoever about what your talking about?
-	-	Well, I personally would say what he did was wrong. And furthermore, I would call him a knuckledragger, too. 
-	-	Clinically crazy? Or just different values? yeah...  
-	-	I didn't say there aren't differences between the states in the USA, but the differences are much smaller than between countries in Europe. They share language, currency, government, and a huge set of laws. They share several federal institutions and they have the same president. This is not true for Europe. Some countries in Europe are of course similar to each other but other differs a lot. Try to compare the UK with Ukraine, Russia with Portugal or Serbia with Denmark instead of Ireland and the UK. And yes, France and the UK are quite different.

0	1	........ your sentence couldn't have made less sense.  engrish! fuck yeh!
-	-	just like christianity...
-	-	YEAH, JUST LIKE CATHOLICISM
0	2	Actually, 10 years is pretty long for Denmark. I think 14 years is the regular sentence for murder (in extreme cases: life, but that's rarely more than 20). I'd have loved for this piece of shit to serve out his time in Somalia though. Life in a Danish prison is a holiday, especially if you are used to things in Somalia.
-	-	He is deported after the sentence is served. Banned from entering Denmark for life.
-	-	And the chance of dying would probably be a hundred times greater.
1	8	10 years is a long time, and harsher sentences doesn't lower crime.
1	4	This is good.  This stupid man failed on many levels when it comes to Shari'ah Law: he tried to kill someone for blasphemy, he tried to inflict too harsh a punishment for blasphemy without asking them to recant, he tried to punish a non-believer for blasphemy which is impossible, he tried to punish a non-believer who is protected in a completely different judicial system, he tried to punish someone without being a legitimate witness to the crime, he tried to punish someone without a court order and thus is a vigilante, he invaded someone's privacy, he caused property damage, and he's also probably lying about only trying to frighten him.  He did something idiotic and was tried under their law and got punished for it.
-	-	&gt; How else are you supposed to judge a group?  Eh, dont?
0	2	/r/atheism is full of self-righteous pricks.  Every Muslim I've ever met has been secular and friendly.  It can go both ways.
0	1	The way things work isn't a very good justification - a tiger that can get to you presents an immediate danger.   The are a number of reasons this logic does apply to groups:  * In most cases they do not represent an immediate threat and you have the time to evaluate the situation  * People automatically assume that groups whom they are not members of are more homogeneous than they actually are and because of this apply negative traits (which are more commonly known due to the nature of news reporting) to the entire group. * People tend to believe groups they are not members of are inferior  There is of course more to group dynamics but suffice to say most people would disagree with many judgements applied to them due to group membership, and would have a reasonable basis for doing so. 
-	-	The irony of your statement is that radical Islamists use the same reasoning to justify attacking the Unites States. There are plenty of propaganda pieces in which Americans are portrayed as violent, materialistic, and morally vacant, that radical groups use to convince their fellows that all Americans are similar and deserve the same fate as those who have invaded their country.   That both parties view their adversaries through such narrow lenses is both unrealistic and counter-productive.
1	8	He did nothing wrong. He excercised his freedom of speech, which is not only protected by law, it's a goddamn foundation of western society.
-	-	For the love of me and the rest of the western internet, **DON'T GIVE THEM INTERNET CONNECTION**
-	-	atheists act like douches.  lesbians act like douches.  feminists act like douches.  every group has members who act like douches.
1	5	The thing is, that the group in question is so huge that one individual makes a very poor sample. It's human nature to do so, you just have to remind yourself that you have no basis for the assumption.
-	-	&gt; It's not stupid, it's just the ways things work.  Yes it's stupid.  &gt; Why should this simple logic not apply to groups of people as well?  It does, but you forgot a smalll detail.  You forgot to mention that it's very important how plausible it is for a member of the group to be dangerous. Isolated events which are small in numbers compared to the number of members does not make the whole group dangerous, it has to be very likely that a member may be dangerous for you in order to consider any member of the groups dangerous.  Example of such groups of people:    * Serial killers   * Soldiers in war(or whatever we are supposed to call it today)   * Murderers 
0	1	in that case, all americans are [stupid](http://activistsandairplanes.com/files/2011/02/george-bush.jpg). all germans are [cannibals](http://pysih.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/armin-meiwes3-300x300.jpg) and all the brits are john cleese.  this clearly isn't true, i have a german room-mate and i haven't woken up *one day* to find a chunk of my flesh missing.
-	-	No worries. 
-	-	i don't believe that i was speaking to you
-	-	I'm not American. Basically the only time I see Christians on the news is when it's Christmas or Easter and the pope makes a speech.   Muslims on the other hand I see either when shit's being blown up, people are being killed or some other uncivilized activity is taking place. Media bias? Perhaps.
-	-	The entire population of the US did not and does not support the reasons we were given to go into Iraq. You are guilty of the very generalizations you are wishing other people wouldn't make.  Muslims who live by the Quran and enact Sharia **are** bigger assholes than your average person. And there are plenty of them who wish to do this. Muslims who are moderate and have adopted modern views and values (directly ignoring their holy book as a result) aren't bigger assholes. This goes for every religion. It just so happens that Islam is the biggest problem child religion at the moment.
0	2	That's probably shitty. As a somali myself, I can admit when things get shitty. I love how Denmark has become in the somali community since many of them started moving away, because of the tougher immigration laws. Though I don't like how you group all somali together. So please don't do that. Yeah, many/majority of Somali that congregate in a city generally cause a lot of problems. But there are still gold among our people, and they are the ones I don't like to see get labeled.
-	-	Americans are all different races though, so it's harder to call someone racist for ripping on Americans.
0	5	oh come on.  somalia is a pretty homogeneous country; america isn't.
0	2	Well, Western 'tribes' don't really go about pack raping and murdering anything they can find. Tell me, do you know of many other nations that have such an appaling daily way of life? Can these people not fucking learn? Ever seen that pic of Rome 2000 years ago compared to Africa, today? It's spot on. 
-	-	The error rate is actually fairly high in other cases as well. I work in a public defender's office, and the tactics used by the prosecution tend to lead to a lot of cases being retried. 
0	2	Yeah, and rest of us are rejecting the level of cultural relativism you are suggesting.   Say  6 year old you and a friend named joey are playing in the park. You and Joey are joking around and you end up saying that Joey says that he believes that the birds are his friends and he talks to them. You say, "Joe that is stupid! Birds aren't talking to you!"  Joey pulls out a knife and stabs your neck.  Does the adult you tell the 6-year-old-you that Joey just have different values and that you should understand?
-	-	Life = 16 years. If you're completely deranged, you can get a medical sentence, only to be released when doctors deem you fit (Kafka, anyone?).
0	2	It's a ten year holiday in a confined space, effectively being locked in a motel room, and all your neighbors are scary.  Prisons are not supposed to be hellholes, the sentence is _incarceration_, being deprived of freedom.  The problem with locking religious nutwits up is that they tend to hang out together in prison and make each other even more fundamentalist. That's a problem everywhere, not just in scandinavian prisons.
-	-	A wild Muslim apologist appears! Uses "IT'S NOT ANTISEMETISM". It's not very effective.
-	-	Reminder that it was _George W Bush_ who said it.
0	1	Christianity has been pretty peaceful in the last few hundred years since you know, we stopped acting like barbarians.  If a Christian kills someone in the name of god, they are fucked. Even other Christians will hate them.
1	6	Except when were talking about Republicans, Fox News, or anything remotely right wing, amirite?
-	-	He chose to ally himself with that group and then follow through with his group's ire against a cartoonist.
-	-	Indeed, however, I don't see what is so hostile about judging original texts or the foundation of a group or religion.  Every group, no matter how peaceful, will produce assholes.  A violent group, no matter how hideous, will produce good people.  It seems bizarre, but its pretty much guaranteed.  Human diversity and all that jazz.    The question then, is how well a groups creed or source material can be interpreted as a call to peace or a call to violence.  The easier it is to justify violent actions within their culture and source material, the more violent assholes a group will have.    If your source material has pages of text dedicated to calling the group to combat against others, dehumanizing those not of the group, or demanding that members of the group conquer and control those not of the group - don't be amazed if that groups spawns numerous violent assholes.
-	-	Except when were talking about Republicans, Fox News, or anything remotely right wing, amirite?
1	8	We judge groups based on the actions of individuals all the time. It's not stupid, it's just the ways things work.  You don't give a tiger the benefit of doubt. You assume it is dangerous based on experience. And this experience is based on previous actions of members of its kind.   Why should this simple logic not apply to groups of people as well?
1	6	Maybe they ought to reconsider giving safe harbour to people who aren't going to respect the law of the land.
-	-	NOT IN MY AMURKA
-	-	well that's a little extreme.
-	-	Alternate source: http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/22/us-denmark-cartoons-trial-idUSTRE75L2SA20110622
-	-	Europeans didnt come to South Africa as refugees.
-	-	I wanna get on this train to the bottom.
-	-	Compared to some countries that don't accept a lot of immigrants Sweden is working quite well.  Compare crime and health statistics between Sweden and the USA, for example. 
1	7	It hasn't worked _perfectly_, but it's certainly worked fairly well. All immigrants go through a course in swedish culture and language, and most slot in to swedish society well. The problems are with some (but far from all) muslims. Sweden takes in more refugees from Iraq and Afghanistan than the US does, and it is hard to get uneducated and nearly illiterate but deeply religious people to adapt to a modern secular society like Sweden.
-	-	[This](http://www.nolanchart.com/article8465_Who_are_Libya%27s_rebels.html) is where I got the main bulk of the information.  The question that has never been asked by Western media is, "Who are the rebels?"  Besides, is everything I said so hard to believe?  I think the official story is a lot more unbelievable.  Case in point: what *is* the official story, besides the accusation that Gaddafi "slaughters his own people"?
0	2	I honestly don't give a fuck about Gaddafi.  Or I didn't.  I certainly don't idolize him—on the contrary, it is the Western media who demonizes him.  You sound almost proud to be parroting CNN or Fox News or MSNBC, all of whom say exactly the same thing on this topic: that for some vague reason even though our economy is going bankrupt and we're already committed to 3 wars, our conscience is not going to allow us *not* to enter a 4th one.  Does that not sound even a little suspicious to you?  Do you really think I "hate" the West?  Do I hate freedom too?  How old are you?  Do you realize you have a grade-school understanding of politics and international relations?  Everybody does—at least everybody who believes we're in Libya to liberate some oppressed rebels from an evil massacring tyrant.  I am a proud American citizen.  That's why I am fuming that my government has been hijacked by a bunch of con-artists hell-bent on waging war so that a few extremely rich people can get richer, while sons and daughters perish in battle and entire nations crumble to poverty.  Did you know Libya is one of the most prosperous nations in Africa?  Did you know its citizens enjoy a society more egalitarian than that of the United States, and that its citizens' life expectancy is only a year lower than ours?  Libya also has state-sponsored health care and welfare programs, which were created by Gaddafi along with other reforms dating back to the mid '70s.  We are in Libya invading the hell out of it and trying to oust Gaddafi because in our view, Gaddafi is **stealing** his nation's oil that rightfully belongs to our Western oil companies.  There are other possibly more important reasons too, but I'm trying to stay outside the realm of conspiracy theory.  Everything I said can be verified as fact; I'm not an America-hating Muslim supporter or something... I don't give a flying fuck about Islam unless Islam tries to fuck with me.

0	2	Should have gotten a longer sentence. 
-	-	Don't link to foxnews?
1	6	Will it actually be 10 years or could he get paroled earlier? 
1	6	My question is, and this is an honest question, how does a Somali man end up in Scandinavia to begin with?
-	-	Whenever you're in a bit of a moral quandary about law enforcement ask yourself "What would Cofer Black do?".  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofer_Black#After_9.2F11:_the_.22war_on_terror.22  &gt; Armitage and Cofer flew to Moscow to seek help from top Russian diplomatic and intelligence officials. &gt; &gt; "We're in a war," Black told the Russians. "We're coming. Regardless of what you do, we're coming anyway." He knew Afghanistan was in their sphere of influence and they would be queasy. "At the very least we want you to look away." He did not want the Russians trying to gum up CIA operations. "From my humble position, I think this is a historical opportunity. Let's get out of the last century into the next one." &gt; &gt; The Russians indicated they would help and certainly not obstruct. One noted that Afghanistan was ambush heaven, where the guerrilla fighters had demolished the Russian army. "With regret," the Russian said, "I have to say that you're really going to get the hell kicked out of you". &gt; &gt; **"We're going to kill them," Black said. "We're going to put their heads on sticks. We're going to rock their world."** &gt; &gt; The Russians soon sent a team to the CIA to provide extensive on-the-ground intelligence, especially about the topography and caves of Afghanistan.  I think they should cut this dudes head off and mount it on a pike as a warning that European civilisation is not to be messed with. Also I'd build a big graven image of Cofer Black and make people sacrifice to it or be fed to the lions. The Romans did this with the Christians and most modern historians like Edward Gibbon now believe if they'd killed a mere 6789125267% more people we'd have been saved the Dark Ages and be flying around the universe in starships now.   The lesson is clear - extreme brutality is actually the least bad option when dealing with virulent religions.

1	8	I hope for the entire 10 years they have someone outside of his cell continuously drawing pictures of "the prophet" and after he finishes one everyone in the prison comes over and takes a shit on it.

1	8	I think you are right here.   But if it would be like raze78 says, that everybody uses the word nigger, because it means black person. Then it is not not insulting or offensive or a problem.

1	8	Wow, better than most of China where it's around $1 per day for around 750m people.  When I was there I read about a particular region known for its poverty (forget the name, famous for making illegal guns), where the *average yearly* income was £36 (~$50).
1	4	Thank God. Too bad he'll have to spend 10 years in a Danish prison first... That'll probably be the best part of this sentence for him.
1	6	Oh you think attempted, premeditated murder should be less than 10 years?
0	1	Or maybe the sentence was harder because...he tried to kill someone!
1	8	Um, more to the point, he *tried to kill a man* over a **cartoon**. This is not rational, no matter if it were valid under Shari'a Law or not.

1	6	What's your point?
0	1	You seem to have more faith in the Danish prison system than I do, but yes, hopefully they'll be able to turn him into a functioning member of society, who understands that you can't kill people just because they offend you.      And yes, I know you were just being sarcastic, but in some parts of the world, our correctional facilities are actual correctional facilities and not just places to lock away unwanted people.
-	-	Wild american appears defending their crappy prison for life system that they pay with their taxes.  Also rule of law, I want to kill few people yet I am free...  
-	-	After the ten years he'll be deported back to Somalia, where he can kill with impunity since there are no laws and no government of which to speak.
-	-	We're Americans, we only know that the place that those places are in is Europe much like you couldn't point out where Nebraska or any of the other flyover states are over here.

-	-	Hopefully the ban extends to all of the EU. 
1	4	So in 7 years he'll come across the bulgarian border in a truck and finish the job. Nice.
1	8	He's also going to get deported, presumably to Somalia.   Somalia has a per capita GDP of about $1.60 a day.    
-	-	Yeah "life sentence" is about 10 years in Sweden, if not less.
-	-	Denmark afraid of extremist backlash? More likely, the sentence was harder because he's Somali.
1	6	Would you trade your freedom or take your chances in that terrible terrible hellhole that you know so much about?

-	-	Can't say it did any wonders for me.
-	-	And learning French did wonders for me when I travelled to Italy. That doesn't mean they sound similar; they just are similar in origin.
1	6	In broad strokes, you can start with scrutinizing more closely those refugees coming from countries known to contain pockets of religious extremism. 
0	1	&gt; For bringing **an** **ax** to someones house and forgetting the keys?  FTFY. But it still doesn't make sense in the context of the story. The guy busted into somebody's house with an ax with the intent of killing him for *drawing a picture!*  Also throwing in "america fuck ya" is a non sequiter and pretty much seals the deal for people to completely disregard what you're saying. Who wants to listen to somebody who is dumb enough to stereotype an entire country. I guess in your world all Italians are philanderers who work for the mob. And all French people are snooty wine snobs. And all Africans are child soldiers. And all Chinese people are brilliant mathematicians. Get over yourself.

-	-	I maintain that compared to other groups the level of violence (honor-killings, suicide bombings, violent mobs angry about cartoons etc.) committed by people in the name of their religion is disproportionately higher for Muslims. Where are the angry mobs of Christians, Atheists or Buddhists raging violently about some non-issue happening in another country they can't even point to on map?  Serial killers, soldiers, murders... all good examples of dangerous groups of people, but none of them justify their actions with their religion. The only thing making them a "group" is an act they committed, not a faith they *choose* to believe and act upon.
0	1	Seriously , Why the fuck go into someones country to disrupt and try to impose your beliefs. If you don't like free speech stay the fuck back in your own shithole country. I can speak because I am an immigrant myself.
1	4	Appears I may have hit a nerve there. lol
-	-	I did not down vote you once.
0	1	&gt; OK, so how many stupid Americans or cannibal Germans must you see before you start to see a pattern? 10? 100? 1000?  I'm going to go with "infinite", on the basis that correlation is not causation.
1	5	&gt; I maintain that compared to other groups the level of violence (honor-killings, suicide bombings, violent mobs angry about cartoons etc.) committed by people in the name of their religion is disproportionately higher for Muslims.   Are you serious? Ever heard of the IRA, ETA? Who released anthrax in the USA - white extremist group. Remember the Balkan war? The countries killing shit-loads of people in Iraq/Afganistan, which group do they belong to now again?  &gt; Where are the angry mobs of Christians, Atheists or Buddhists raging violently about some non-issue happening in another country they can't even point to on map?  Eh, the entire USA is raging over, for them, non-issues happening in another country they can't even point to on a map. 
0	3	Quite a lot more than that. There's over 300 million americans out there.
1	8	depends on the kind of pattern you're looking for.  all 300m americans will have to, somehow, display their collective stupidity for all americans to fall in said category. you just can't make disparaging remarks that are, at the same time, accurate. no one can.
-	-	Every Redditor I've met was rather entitled.
1	4	Exactly, I'm glad you see my point.
1	4	I'm pretty sure the billion+ non-violent practitioners of Islam are a good sample.
1	6	*How large of a sample do you need for a group this large? ... How large of a sample does it take for a disavowal be taken seriously?*  polling agencies tackle these kind of questions every day. a smaller group should be a near-accurate representation of the larger group. picking a representative group of a large (very large) group is difficult in itself. automatically *finding* such a representative group among a bunch of people that have been involved in a horrific act(s) is just bad methodology.  9/10 "islamic" fuckwads (edit: that carry out these attacks) are really angry MEN. (note: quotation marks). that isn't an accurate representation of the muslim world in general so we shouldn't judge an entire race by the actions of a group that doesn't represent them properly. or at all.
1	4	I like that. In the US it's almost standard to repeal.
-	-	I'm sure there won't be any other Somalis in there to keep him company, everyone knows they're model immigrants.
-	-	Yeah but then it's about mental issues and you'll be under 'treatment' 
-	-	Tell me, how would you determine this chance?  Punishment for crimes, not for some chances
-	-	actually, i was referring to garris' version. also, shining was kubrick's weakest work, imo. basically, the story sucks. bad stephen king.
-	-	i can see that you're quite the somalia scholar.
1	8	Indeed. They are *totally* different bands.
-	-	Well, not by name, but by (false) assumptions about what the US is like. Using America and the US as synonyms is a better example.
0	2	I guess that's true, but how does that affect what we call it in English? So the accidental implication that the USA and America are the same thing was wrong? How relevant, hehe.
-	-	You've met Dutch people from Holland who refer to the Netherlands as Holland.
0	1	I don't think that this was the thought process of the convicted man, nor do I think that he respects the beliefs of others. To him, there is one right and good belief, and the rest are wrong and evil. It's not a question of simply imposing his beliefs on another, it's more a matter of "convert or die, because this is the only way."
0	1	This is just wrong. If you moved to saudi arabia and wished that women should have more rights, they'd probably say the exact same thing: "why did you move here and not respect our beliefs that the women is subhuman?"  If it's wrong, it's wrong everywhere. And if it's right, it's right everywhere.  Now, threatening someone with an axe is wrong everywhere, and free speech is right everywhere. But that's not the point.
1	5	We just call them refugees here. Who cares where they came from?
1	6	There hasn't been much said about the Libya situation, the major news deliverers has more or less has treated it like "It's good with revolutions, islam is bad."   The worst thing about Ghadaffi seems to be that he has big women as bodyguards if you go by big news. Apparently that is enough for people in general to support a revolution...

1	4	I seriously don't understand how people can mistake these two countries for one another. Even though our countries lie fairly close to each other, we don't share that much history together compared to our neighbour countries. And even though you may think our language sound familiar it's not the same. At all. But we love beer, football and cycling, and that's awesome.
0	1	That is a common assumption, but wrong. Life is life - but you can appeal for leniency after (I think) 12 years and the typical length of time served is 16.  That said a four time police murder spent 32 years and 8 months in prison.
-	-	I think Americans hear the word "Netherlands" and assume it is an all-encompassing term that refers to all Scandinavian countries simply because it is plural.
0	1	Christian hitler tried to killed all jews 65 years ago.  Anyway christians countries were not under attack, occupation and generally lots of foreign influence in last few decades.   If Israel is marching it armies in your country every few years reducing everything to dust, if you see how american money are keeping obscenely rich King in power, if you see democraticly elected governments overthrown with support from the west you have some reason to resort to violence...
0	1	Anything negative about a jew even though it's true? Antisemitism! Anything negative about a mulsim? Free speech. Hypocrisy like this always amuses me. 
0	2	Crime is more prevalent in the US because you have no social security net while Sweden do, aswell as Socialized medicine. That said, we have HUGE problems with cime (compared to how sweden were just 2 decades ago). The sad truth is that we have a shitload of sandpeople and niggers raping and pillaging.
-	-	Or Denmark.
1	4	That's why he's being deported after his sentence.
1	6	How do you know if a refugee is going to respect the law or not?
0	3	So you don't see when American Christian terrorists murder doctors or commit arson against abortion clinics? Odd.
-	-	Kyllä! Hyvää juhannusta!
0	5	&gt; The entire population of the US did not and does not support the reasons we were given to go into Iraq. You are guilty of the very generalizations you are wishing other people wouldn't make.  I don't mean individuals, I meet a lot of people from the USA that doesn't support the war, I see demonstrations and movements popping up.  I did generalize because I wanted to point out the problem with generalization, which is what people do with islam and muslims.
-	-	Yes, but judging it by the content of the beliefs is not
-	-	"Islam" is not a group of people, it's an ideology. "Muslims" are the group of people who follow Islam. Criticising Islam is not the same as being discriminatory towards Muslims.
0	2	Yeah I know it still occurs from what people say, etc but I was talking specifically that they are still upset about this event, it just seems a bit ridiculous.
0	2	Yeah I know it still occurs from what people say, etc but I was talking specifically that they are still upset about this event, it just seems a bit ridiculous.
0	1	That whole event was odd. How did a bunch of nearly illiterate people on the deep afghan countryside find out about a koran-burning which had happened just days earlier?  It took the syrian secret service eight months to find &amp; start pushing propaganda about the danish cartoons, but whoever played those afghans was a lot better prepared and informed.
1	6	How else are you supposed to judge a group?  If some individuals act like douches, then hang out with a group of similar people I'm going to assume it is a group of douches.  Do you judge your local police department by the training drills they do as groups, or their actions as individuals?  
-	-	Lolbertarian paradise!
1	4	What has that got to do with it? Because you think a cartoon is harmless, doesn't mean everyone else does...
-	-	Religious people be nuts, yo.
0	2	&gt; what a single pastor in the US did behind closed doors  Also the media. There was just no need for that idiot to have any time on television. There will always be idiots on this planet and reporting on that particular idiot was not worth eight lives. 
-	-	BUT ISLAM IS A RELIGION OF PEACE
0	3	uh... hm... yes?  Destroying a human for such a petty reason seems pretty crazy to me. But then again, bla bla bla moral relativism bla bla bla, amirite?
-	-	Yes.
0	2	Yes, Texas is just like New York and Ireland, the UK and France are so different. And of course all states share common laws, history and government right? Oh wait they don't, are you like a Euro redneck or something? Or just a typical ignorant European who is so arrogant about his ignorance he views it as a strength?
-	-	I'm American.  edit: Just look at stuff like this: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12591413/ns/us_news-education/t/young-americans-shaky-geographic-smarts/
1	6	And as you go south in Denmark you'd hear it becoming a lot more German in sound but also a lot more fiendish in its dialect (Southern Jutland is one of the bastions of an evil dialect considered horrible by even other Jutlanders).
0	2	WHAT THE FUCK  Danish doesn't sound even remotely like German.
-	-	...I know...
0	2	True, excuse my attempt at humor. I was just thinking how insulted some people would be at being called German.
-	-	I don't know the exact math to do the calculation to be honest.   &gt;&gt;Shouldn't a group make every effort to disavow the actions of individuals if they aren't representative of the group?  We are both part of the group internet users. Should we make every effort to disavow internet child pornographers? If we should, then why don't we? Is it fair to portray us as or at least associate us with child pornographers, now that we don't?
1	8	That is true, and I would maintain he did nothing which was EITHER wrong OR illegal.  It is not his fault that knuckledraggers respond to freedom of speech by randomly killing innocent civilians - the guilt belongs entirely to the knuckledraggers.
1	6	Hey man have you heard of that Bill guy or Glenn Beck? Did you miss the post a few days back news stories they have lied about?   Etc. 
0	2	I disagree in the sense that we *should* give legitimate news stories like this one page views on Fox, and just stay away from the slanted articles. The message this would send to Fox would be that more people care about *news* stories, and that they should publish more of them.
-	-	Wrong - it still increases their traffic, and those numbers are used to sell advertising.
-	-	It's really not that hard to demonstrate that Fox News has a Republican agenda.
-	-	Yeah. u mad?

1	6	&gt; Oh my God      FTFY, "allah" is the Arab word for "god".

1	4	Love the hivemind. Feed the hivemind. Enjoy karma. 
-	-	Then what are you doing on reddit?  EDIT: Hey, I'm not hating on reddit. I'm here too. But fact is every news piece is submitted as propaganda here, and upvoted by people who agree with it. It's a system intentionally designed to reinforce prejudices and spread propaganda.
-	-	Well, I wouldn't say "not hard". Someone will have to watch Fox News...
1	6	what?! it wasn't nearly as good as the book. which also sucked.
-	-	TIL That redditors don't know the difference between Denmark and The Netherlands.
-	-	He got 9 years, then appealed and got 10. &gt;.&lt;
1	5	Your country would suck, too, if for centuries two continents abused your people for cheap labor and resources.
0	3	Ten years is a lot of time for attempted murder. You can get ten years for a successful murder here in Sweden, I'm sure Denmark is not *that* different.  Are you expecting some ridiculous American 4000-year prison sentence?
1	8	Locked in a room, supplied with food, access to Tv and gaming consoles? You're right - it could be worse..
-	-	Yes, breaking and entering with an axe is not 10 years sentence here in Europe  Punishment was extra hard because of terrorism tight with this crime.  Do not trust miami CSI when they are scaring people without lawyer present with wild number of years for anything...
1	4	FYI a "life" sentence in Denmark is 16 years, that's the longest amount of time you'll get locked away here, and that's the sort of sentence you get if you successfully murder someone.
-	-	Al-lah = "The God"  The Arabic emphasizes the monotheistic aspect, as that is of supreme importance in Islam ([unless you're the founder of the religion and you're under siege, things are looking grim, and your oppressors will only be appeased if you recognize *their* deities as equals, in which case you can claim a revelation recognizing their deities, but only until you can safely escape, and then you can claim an angel visited you and told you the revelation came from Satan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_Verses)).  So "Oh my Allah" is redundant; it's just "Oh Allah." 
0	1	Here in Sweden, people seem to get around 5 years in prison for attempted, premediated murder, and that's when they successfully stab their victim. Did this axe guy manage to hit someone?
-	-	Europe has survived far longer than your puny little nation of USA. 
0	1	usually i would agree. But when the crime has its root in religious fantatiscm with the sole intent to deter others from expressing themselves in (In Denmark) legal way, then it stops being "just" a crime  If that logic would be followed, then 9/11 was also "just" a crime. Hijacking and murder
1	4	Yes that's all well and good. You called him secular and your position was weakened accordingly. It was laughable and certainly not fact to anyone who has payed a modicum of attention (if we're going to go on demeaning each other). He had social welfare programs and Libya had low poverty rates. But he definitely was not secular. I never said NATO has pure intentions with their involvement in Libya. I never said there wasn't huge problem with wealth disparity in the United States. These are things you are prescribing to me because I called you out.   Also, this has nothing to do with the OP, which was another indication that you were a bit stark, raving mad at the time. It was an oddly placed tirade about the Libyan intervention.  Have a good day, sir. No hard feelings.
0	2	That question *has* been asked several times by western media. Even fucking Fox news has discussed this, I believe. In fact, I am not sure any one has denied the claims that there are some Islamic fundamentalists mixed in with the movement. Just because you didn't pay enough attention to know this, doesn't meant the rest of the world has been depraved of the knowledge.  Yes. It is still hard to believe Gaddafi was a secular ruler.
1	4	I agree.. I saw something on TV about Canadian prisons and was quite impressed. They work with the prisoners, apparently, and try to make them see why what they did was wrong. Our way of "you get a time out because you've been naughty" doesn't work on adults I think.
1	6	A much more homogenous populations?? Maybe if you go by skin color, but not if you consider language and culture.   About the muslims, they are a part of Europe and European history. The muslims re-educated the western world after we forgot everything, but sure, ignore that. And guess what, we have 'white' muslims here. And they've been muslims a long time, it's not a skin-color division. You don't know what you're talking about.
0	2	Europeans have been butchering each other for thousands of years. you really think that we are scared of couple of brown people ?
1	8	Haha, you are too clueless to be real.
-	-	In this case I disagree. This is a newsworthy event. The publication of the cartoons and what followed was major news, everything related to this is news.
-	-	Unless you're left-handed. 
-	-	Came here just to find this comment and downvote it. I knew I'd find you!
-	-	Is that really necessary?
0	5	I blame The Shining, look at what western cultural influences do. It clearly worked there so he was just trying to emulate the film.
0	2	I don't know. I think the punishment doesn't necessarily have to fit the crime but should be custom catered to the criminal will be vulnerable to. Militant islamists (or other militants) do not care about being locked up; staunch ideology is a very difficult to unlearn. What's more, many  Why not punish him with something that would be terrible to him? Religious zealots are usually homophobic and racist, so line up a bunch of huge gay black dudes to do a train on his ass.   Sorry, I know that's a very controversial thing to say but I have no respect or care for anyone that tries to silence freedom of press/speech.   And if rehabilitation is more important, we shouldn't be advocating punishment at all, but rather a method that would rehabilitate all of these idiots by allowing them to live with Western families or some such. 
1	4	Well done.  Nobody should link to Fox News, it's a propaganda outlet, not news.
1	6	I dunno, there is that whole 'innocent until proven guilty' thing to consider. Can they prove he actually tried to kill him?      Maybe he should have just been charged with breaking and entering plus threatening with a lethal weapon, gotten a couple of years jail time then deported.

0	5	My goodness, you just implicitly condoned censoring the views of non-immigrants!
0	1	10 years for attempted murder is not harsh enough.  The different between attempted murder and murder should be small in terms of punishment, if the intentions are the same.

1	8	You can speak because you are a human being. Don't think that you can only say something on the basis that "you're and immigrant". Speak because you want to be heard.  You've a very valid point, and I really dislike the fact that the statement can be labelled by others as racist.
-	-	It's actually not that harsh considering life in a Danish prison is likely preferable to life in Somalia. He won't be looking forward to his release.
1	6	Netherlands? Are you incapable of reading?
1	6	Where do you learn this from? I see nothing about the Netherlands in this thread?
-	-	No... Kurt Westergaard is a Danish man living in Denmark.  Not a Dutchman from the Netherlands. 
0	1	You don't think that The Netherlands and Denmark is the same, do you?   I was going to say that you are a stupid American, but then I would get a storm of downvotes. Fuck this, I'm probably going to anyway.
1	6	For the first three months. Then the novelty of sleeping in a bed, eating unaccustomed food, and watching danish comedies on TV wears off, and he's just locked up and deprived of his freedom.
0	2	Hehe,, actually I've never in my life met another Dane who had a panic room. Westergaard had one installed since he had recieved more than a hundred death threats and people several times had tried to get their hands on him. Ahh,, the religion of peace. Magnifique.
0	2	So we can deny all the lies and editing of videos fox does if they happen to do few things correctly? Every newspaper would wish they could be held to such low standards. And obviously muslims are extremists, clearly this man and the thousands of other terrorists and zealots are representatives for billions of people, after all their actions is for the sake of these extremists.  You're the reason I ask my self why I still haven't removed this shit form my frontpage, and had it not been for the useful links i would.
-	-	Where 's the grammar or spelling error except amurica?    
-	-	&gt;Danes are the new Nazis  This is ironic at levels you don't comprehend.
-	-	TIL I'm apparently a nazi
1	6	Confirmation bias? The nutjobs get the most attention in any group.  What Christians do you see on the news? Westboro Baptist Church, or the one with a bunch of old grannies singing old songs?
1	8	Somali muslims (i.e Somalis in general) as a group don't tend to paint a great picture of themselves here or abroad. Disproportionate representation of sexual assaults for example, high unemployment, a lack of integration, drug dealing... Don't get me wrong, I'm sure you are a nice person and all, hard working and committed to the liberal western values of Finland but a whole group is easily stereotyped when enough members harm the society around them.
1	8	If you open someones abdominal cavity because they call you a coward? Crazy. Not to be taken seriously or to be respected. Not fit for society.  You aren't deep, dude. 
1	4	Living on the German border and watching German TV did it for me. Thankfully I cured myself with lots of English books and films.
0	1	He's not defending islam, you fucking idiot. Don't you realize how much of a dick you are to equate islam with "crazy people who tries to kill other people with axes" when there's several hundred million people into islam?
1	6	I guess that wasn't directed at me, but at the one I replied to? 
-	-	name your least favorite book of the qur'an
-	-	You are a gross, fucked up idea. Some people are crazy fanatic muslims, and most, well, they're not crazy. They're simply muslims. Suprise!
0	5	i have no idea where you got that from.  the reason i put "islamic" in quotes was because i was quoting (almost) every racist rhetoric that aims to make the word islam synonymous with terrorism, and, as my last sentence clearly suggests, i do not hold that view.  the acts of an individual do not have any bearing on the character of the ethnic group / social class / race that he or she belongs to unless this person is acting with the consent of the people in question.  al qaeda isn't an elected group. the muslims don't elect them. therefore, it isn't right to blame islam or muslims for the actions of al qaeda. same goes for every "terrorist" attack. these people speak for themselves and not for people of their faith, class, nationality etc.  please read my post again and if i do, anywhere, endorse the idea of blaming all muslims for the actions of a handful of people, i'll gladly acquiesce and edit it out.
-	-	therefore, texas manages to spawn an axe murderer doesn't make all texans are axe murderers.
0	2	Ah yes, the radical Islamists are the same as Americans.  Oh wait, that's bullshit.    To demonstrate, a quick thought experiment.  Lets say a weapon has been invented that can kill any number of people anywhere, and target accurately any specific individual on earth. Uses portal technology or something.  If you gave this to the US, would they wipe out scores of civilians, or use it to target specific individuals who are in the way of their business interests?    Now hand that device to any group of violent Islamists.  Do you believe they would have any moral qualms against using the device against scores of heretics and unbelievers?  The US wants your money.  The Islamists want to dominate everybody to please their imaginary friend.  Don't pretend these groups are equivalent. 
1	6	Oh no, we lack stone-age morals! Oh no, the horrors of *materialism*.  What a crock.
0	1	Now you are just being a douchebag european trying to make it look like americans are all stupid. Right?
-	-	I'm not talking about size, that's kind of irrelevant. I'm talking about different cultures, languages, currencies, laws, history, government etc. The country borders in Europe are something completely different than the state borders in the USA.
-	-	People have different opinions on stuff, I might gut you for telling me I am a coward and a scoundrel. Does that make me and lots of those dueling english gentlemen crazy? 
-	-	*He did nothing wrong* does not equal *He did nothing illegal*.
-	-	&gt; He did nothing legally wrong  FTFY. *Needlessly* endangering others is *morally* wrong. Also, hate speech is not protected speech under many jurisdictions. 
1	6	I'm aware; I was just playing devil's advocate.  If you don't mind I would like to continue with a couple questions.  How large of a sample do you need for a group this large?  Shouldn't a group make every effort to disavow the actions of individuals if they aren't representative of the group?  How large of a sample does it take for a disavowal be taken seriously?
1	8	Every Muslim I've met was a Jihadist.  It can go both ways.
0	1	If a person is a self-admitted member of a group then it is only reasonable to expect that person to show traits, beliefs and actions common to said group.  The problem then becomes knowing what actually are the common traits, beliefs and actions of a certain group. If certain vocal minorities within a group show traits, beliefs or actions that are not shared by the majority, then perhaps the majority needs to do a better job of showing that they are indeed different and that they do not silently tolerate such behavior?
-	-	They've both got windmills too, though very different kinds.
1	6	I have certainly never mistaken the nationality when its mentioned in the headline, thats for sure.
1	7	And at some points in history have we been influenced by french and german culture, the most common language among the upperclass would at times be either german or french because it was considered more classy.

-	-	The names are popularly interchangeable when describing The Netherlands.
-	-	hola amigo
1	6	Has his family talked to him to see what on Earth is going on?
1	4	Problem is, he'll be hailed as a hero in Somalia.
1	4	Oh yes, of course - I totally agree that he should've been sentenced to 10 years, pending deportation back to Somalia where he can live in his ancap, Sharia paradise in peace. Then again, I find it hard to look at the issue so splittingly. But that may just be me: I cannot, as hard as I try with almost any issue affecting society, see any issue black-and-white-ly.  For example: there's no doubt that this is a very, *very* strong-minded individual (a strong mind being one that is resistant to change). How could he not be, being willing to murder and suffer for his beliefs? As for respect for the laws of a society: he believes that the laws of that society are incorrect, plane and simple. I am a bit of a moral objectivist in some regards, but for an individual who has for his entire life only known Islamofascism, and an individual who probably came and settled in Scandinavia with sabotage firmly in mind, it is hard to write him off as one who is nothing more than an evil, destructive man. He's been affected by his upbringing in a way that I'm sure that many of us can't even imagine.
1	7	&gt;he's generally a good willed guy with mutual trust to his neighbors that he wouldn't expect someone to do something like this  OTOH, he apparently ran and hid in his **panic room**.
0	2	Sometimes I think it would be an insult to call someone a Dane.
-	-	The reason for French to have been to prevalent in earlier times is because France was the most powerful nation in Europe during most of the middle ages, the reneseance all up to the early 1900's. Also it was the centre for culture.
1	6	For quite sometime I thought Holland and The Netherlands were one and the same!
-	-	I hail from the shithole of Cuba good sire.
1	8	its because you're self-centered cunt.  Can you mistake  Lithuania and Latvia? Slovakia and Slovenia? Bulgaria and Romania? Yemen and Oman? Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan? Canada and USA? Uruguay and Paraguay? bunch of africans countries?  yeah, you never...
-	-	Actually you do share a bit of history and the language was identical to each other like 1300~ years ago. The Anglo-saxons (founders of England) came from Denmark, Netherlands and North Germany, all speaking the same language and with the same beliefs.  EDIT: Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands share quite alot of history, culture and old beliefs.
1	8	The comment has been downvoted to oblivion...
0	2	&gt; I seriously don't understand how people can mistake these two countries for one another.  People from Netherlands are Dutch and that sounds similar to Danish, and they are both fake Germans.. 
0	1	I could actually. So fuck you.
-	-	I think you're wrong.
-	-	Yeah, only important European countries like Germany, Spain, and England are really enforced in US schools. Every other nation is treated as a state basically, which I would assume most Europeans could not name most of them.
1	8	Except that's states, not countries. And you'd be surprised how much people know.
0	2	Yeah, because this never happened. Fox made it all up. If you can't pick the facts out and leave the rest you must be pretty stupid.
1	4	A wild jew appears. He uses bash Islam. It's supper effective, as always.
0	1	Islam is a gross, fucked up idea.  Why do you defend it?
0	2	I, for one, disavow said pornographers.
-	-	Also, I can inform as a dane, when a person who is not yet a citizen, gets a sentence like these, they normally only serve half of it, and are then deported to their native country, and are banned for life from entering Denmark.
1	4	Really? If that's true I'm actually really glad he got 10 years! I was afraid they would be hesitant to sentence him harshly due to fear of extremist backlash. JUSTICE!

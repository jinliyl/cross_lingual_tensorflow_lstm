-	-	nah, Nato is more subtle, they will continue with killing civilians even more, same story with bombing of Yugoslavia
-	-	I don't know what he said exactly, but this would obviously be a really really dumb move for any political leader to make.  My best guess is that he was trying to plea for a ceasefire and making a comparison or something of that sort, and the message was twisted in translation...  Like I said, this is just a guess.  Another endless war "to ensure the security" of our people is the last thing we need right now.
1	4	[HUGE PRO GADDAFI RALLY in Tripoli - Raw Footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWzNhk3zv4U&amp;feature=player_embedded)  There are somethings that western media does not like to show.
-	-	Right on! While we're at it, how about we let the Rwandan Hutu militia strike back against the U.N. for meddling in their affairs? 
0	1	Ok, if you didn’t think he was a delusional psychopath before, I’m sure you do now. What a fucking tool. See Europe? This is why you should have your own militaries capable of ending situations like this as quickly as possible. But at least now you’re also “acting in self defense.” Gaddafi basically just gave the world justification to off him.
0	2	I wish everybody on reddit would watch this video:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7NsXFnzJGw&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player  Reddit is acting like a bunch of mindless war cheerleading goons right now.  It's embarrassing.  Take whatever opinion you like after watching this video, but just remember that the pentagon has been planing on invading Libya for nearly a decade.
-	-	&gt; Oh what's that libya, you sent a rocket  that's never been how he operated. and it's not even what he's threatening to do   [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103)  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_Berlin_discotheque_bombing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_Berlin_discotheque_bombing)
1	4	Kinda like 2 months ago when Gaddafi claimed his Navy has sunk a NATO warship. I guess Gaddafi doesn't remember how well that ended for his Navy. 
0	2	unbelievable rhetoric, even from a Gaddafi apologist like you.   Curious, varietygamer, if you hate the west so much, why not leave Australia and return to your Serbian motherland?
-	-	Didn't the ICC warrant rule any kind of diplomatic solution?  That's exactly the escalation that was predicted.
-	-	Well, that does it.  His fate is sealed now.  Our fate is sealed as well.  We could be at war there for a decade over this remark.  Violence to prevent violence FTW!  Ugh.
-	-	Anyone that considers Gaddafi a tactical genius should stop and consider the stupidity of this statement, both in timing and content. 
-	-	Gaddafi: "YOU FUCK ON ME!?!? I FUCK ON YOU!"
1	6	What about the *rest* of the articles where they talk about Libya? Any thoughts?
-	-	&gt;Does anybody even know what the rebels want?  I'd say it's pretty safe to say that they want to sell everything. They want so much privatization that they found the only guy on the planet with a [Doctorate in Privatization](http://i.imgur.com/muPFf.jpg) to be one of their leaders. I think the interesting question may be; who are the buyers going to be, and what do they want?
-	-	It's been rabid for years. It's just that now it wants to shit in Europe's gardens.
-	-	Does meddling in the affairs of other countries ever come back to bite us?
1	6	&gt;What's this?  That's little kids trying to be clever by being contrarian. Don't believe everything coming out of Gaddafi's mouth.
-	-	He was making the same kind of threats [before the intervention begun](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8390695/Muammar-Gaddafi-threatens-Europe-after-UN-injustice.html).
-	-	To be fair, he had pretty much already gone beyond the point of a diplomatic solution.  It is the case that this ICC warrant will make it hard to get any kind of exile, since these countries would be bound to arrest him.  In the end, though, I think something could be worked out if he really did want to give up.
-	-	UN conducted bombing runs on parts of Rwanda? That's news to me.  This is strictly NATO imperialism in action. Gaddafi is threatening to....gasp.....retaliate. I wonder how that works.
-	-	Nah, there's still a humongous difference between tactical genius and simply being a technological power house. But he's neither one of those.
-	-	Not necessarily. It applied pressure, but he could always be offered immunity in exile. The stick gets bigger, but that makes the carrot look better too. 
-	-	That's why his people are revolting against him, while he lives in a giant gold plated compound. Seems legit. 
-	-	From the wikipedia [page:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Allied_Force)  &gt;The bombing of Yugoslavia was intended to stop the alleged Yugoslav military operation Operation Horseshoe and to keep the Yugoslav army from repeating the alleged atrocities committed in Bosnia. 
-	-	The canal is single lane, it's only 200 meters wide. For the time it would take to remove the wreckage, all shipping between the Middle East/South Asia and Europe would need to go around Africa.   I'm sure someone has done the math, but the price of oil does not react well with large disruptions to the status quo. It went up thirty dollars when the war in Libya started, and that effected less oil than goes through Suez. 
-	-	They're both civil wars with foreign involvement.
0	3	Privitization.  That's the key word.  Socialists should die and be condemned as terrorists.  Here's a quick overview of what Gadaffi was able to accomplish in his 40 year rule:     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXLQAUUpJwU&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player Yeah, he's guilty of ordering a violent supression of  a popular uprising.  That shit happens all the time in countries all over the world.  Gadaffi is specially targeted because of the strategic interests of the united states and NATO.  Brutal regimes exist all over the globe.    This is cherrypicking events and words in an attempt to justify using preemptive military action.  The neocons run the country now.  It doesn't matter which party you elect. 
-	-	Don't understand the question...
-	-	Yeah, Libya was such a paradise under Gaddafi...
-	-	&gt; The CIA, MI6, the French and Italian intelligence operatives are actually the ones orchestrating this movement.  Yeah sure. Arabs can have no initiative of their own and the whole arab spring has to be a CIA operation, right? No evidence needed of course...  I do not deny that France/U.K (which were the 2 countries that were pushing for the intervention btw, not the U.S.) have some interest in getting rid of Gaddafi and helping the insurrection but claiming this movement is orchestrated is not only wrong but also insulting to people who lost their lives in Libya/Syria/Egypt/Bahrain/.... 
-	-	You know, the guys that trained with the small paramilitary force that fought the British Army to a stalemate and won a peace accord with favorable terms. If you don't think that the Libyan army has specialist teams that are fully trained in asymmetrical warfare, and have kept up their connections with the IRA and other special tactics experts, you haven't been paying attention.
-	-	Here's Wes talking about Libya..  (At the end of othe vid)  ttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUhlFO5qjVE&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player
-	-	In this case? Probably valid, but only the targeting of government institutions in europe. 
-	-	Gaddafi's either mad, or just slowly working to become the next Genghis Khan. 
-	-	Troubles?
-	-	Nice try, FBI.
0	3	&gt;And this is how a terrorist is born  Gaddafi's love affair with terrorism started way before this intervention (lockerbie bombing/murder of Yvonnefletcher/...).
-	-	what would you expect from a man who lost his grandchildren and a son in this war..
-	-	Is it time to kill this wild animal?
-	-	People consider him a tactical genius? Maybe 300 years ago, technology is just too great now for him to be making such war mongering statements....
1	4	I wouldn't call him a tactical genius but you definitely gotta give the guy credit for being a survivor. Some of that is good tactics, some of its luck, but he's found a way to hang on all these years. I don't think anyone excepted him to be around months after NATO decided it was finally time for him to go. 
-	-	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXLQAUUpJwU&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player  Edit: look it up, it's true.
1	6	That's working out so well in Afghanistan, may as well add another asymmetrical war of attrition into the mix. What happens if Libyan special forces blow up an oil tanker in the Suez Canal and oil hits $160 a barrel? 
-	-	&gt;I was in Tehran earlier this year and failed to see any demonstrations in the centre of the city, though there were plenty of riot police standing about.   I was in East Berlin in 1989 with a Japanese camera crew who couldn't find any demo anywhere. We went to Alexanderplatz and waited for two hours. The place was crawling with guys in their late 20s and early thirties wearing beige trench coats. There were also tanks on the street corners, and one right in front of what is now the Radisson Blu Hotel.  I got impatient and suggested we go over to the Trinity Church, which had been in the headlines of the West German press for weeks -- the Japanese journalists didn't speak German. We did but by the time we got there the cops had cordoned off the area and we had a tense few moments before getting sent off.  Teheran is a huge city.  http://www.asrema.com/a/A-Aerial_Photos/slides/Aerial_View_of_Tehran_26.11.2008_04-34-44.html  If a guy who doesn't know the language or the city doesn't see a demonstration, it is not proof that the demonstration didn't happen. 
1	6	What's this?  Information that contradicts the popular narrative?  What are you?  Some kinda information terrorist?    Seriously, though, I find it disturbing that your post--presenting facts and opinions outside of the current war cheerleading bi-polar reddit populous--is downvoted without any kind of attempt to refute the articles you posted.  Sure Gadaffi is guilty of ordering a crackdown on this faceless uprising.  Does anybody even know what the rebels want?  Why is this uprising taking place?  And if your answer is that Gadaffi is a brutal dictator who has been in control for 40+ years, you should watch this and then ask how much good he has done vs. bad:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXLQAUUpJwU&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player
-	-	Blowing up a single oil tanker wont even raise oil by $10 a barrel.  Although the ecological impact would be devastating.
-	-	Fortunately, the Libyan war isn't a foreign state largely fighting a movement of the people.  It's a movement of the people (with the help of Foreign states) fighting a State.  Your analogy is quite flawed.
0	1	&gt;That's working out so well in Afghanistan  But the U.S. did not have the support of the people in Afghanistan. The majority of Afghanis are opposed to U.S. involvement and are sympathetic to the Taliban and other extremist forces.  The majority of Libyans are welcoming U.S. and European involvement and see it as the only way of stopping Gaddafi who has killed many of their friends and family members.   Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq were all huge fuck ups. The Libyan intervention however is probably the first war in a long time where the U.S. is fighting for the right side. 
-	-	&gt;Libyan special forces  LOL
-	-	You mean he [retaliated after](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103#Alleged_motive)   &gt;Gulf of Sidra incident (1981) when two Libyan fighter aircraft were shot down. Then, two Libyan radio ships were sunk in the Gulf of Sidra. Later, on 23 March 1986 a Libyan Navy patrol boat was sunk in the Gulf of Sidra followed by the sinking of another Libyan vessel on 25 March 1986  etc etc etc confrontations took place.
1	6	Um, actually, their presences were practically token compared to the US and UK. And they're running out of ammunition in Libya. Like, wtf? Why get involved in a gun fight when you can't afford more bullets when they run out? Now nobody's gonna really take them seriously.
-	-	That kind of discourse is far beyond the acceptable spectrum of debate, and it will unfortunately never happen.  Run for your lives.  This isn't the country you were lead to believe it was. 
-	-	I dunno.  If he is, it's news to me.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Clark#section_3
1	6	I...I read a lot of things. People ask me questions about some of the things I talk about, not having heard it before. I kind of look at them, and explain. I thought I had perspective.  I think this is the first time I've been honestly surprised in a while. Thank you.
-	-	I feel ashamed to even be a U.S. citizen.
-	-	Carry out attacks?  With what?  Catapulting your supporters? 
-	-	Doesn't he realize that the US+Europe is just carrying out a humanitarian mission, and this is nothing about regime change? 
-	-	u mad, brah?
-	-	I know more about them than you seem to know about the skill of having a discussion without resorting to ad hominem attacks.   You're going on ignore, I've fallen into your insult and ignore the issues trap before, anymore and I'd be a masochist.
-	-	You also watched [Rubicon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1389371/), right?
-	-	Of course you don't.
-	-	So you know absolutely nothing about the Troubles or the IRA, I take it? 
-	-	Fighting a state is wildly different than fighting the people.
-	-	You wrote according to the Bosnians? Bosnians have no connection with Kosovo.   It was just an excuse which happened when they figured out they made a mistake.  I don't see how atrocities could have happened because it was a different army, it was 10 years later, and even if they were right there had no reason to attack civilians parts (apartment blocks, heating system, water supply system, trains, TV station, hospital) of Yugoslavia ( miles away from Kosovo where there were no Albanians, no army) only Serbian civilians.   Four times more civilians were killed by Nato than army... It is happening again in Libya.
-	-	It was... my sister is living there, she is foreigner though, but her salary was huuuuuge. Now they had to stop working because of the war.
1	4	I don't really get your point. The Taliban were the State at the start of the Afghan war, and they still claim to be the legitimate representatives of the Afghan people. If NATO escalates the conflict, it's quite likely that the Libyan government will quickly fall and there will be a guerrilla war resembling the one in Afghanistan, with a movement of people fighting a foreign-installed government.   Anyway, at this point several countries in NATO only recognize the Transitional Council as being the government of Libya, so since they are now the State, by definition they are fighting the people.
-	-	If you don't believe me, leading world intellectual also says Nato bombing was a war crime: http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20060425.htm
-	-	So many Gaddafi sympathizers here.... 
-	-	Let's hope he tries some halfbaked plot so nato can let loose, seal team 6 and/or drone him so we can stop wasting money and assets in libya
-	-	Oh to be a dreamer.
0	3	And this is how a terrorist is born just some people call them terrorist others call them resistance fighters/ freedom fighters. Bombing and killing in someone's else country..their home (compound), family (grandson and other family members) and then complain when they do the same to you. Keep it up all NATO countries and soldiers you are doing a great service for the military industrial complex.
-	-	Ghaddafi is crazy, but he has the capability to make this kind of attack happen, even without his military intact.  If i were Europe i would be doubling up on airline security measures.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103
-	-	Nonesense
0	1	I wonder how the people against this intervention would feel if it was *their* country being terrorized by an insane fascist, *their* mothers and daughters gang raped by soldiers, *their* life-long friends executed by government death squads? Would they still be saying *"Stop meddling in other countries affairs"*?  This is a great example of "My life is great, why give a fuck about other people."  But hey, if we pull out of Libya and let Gaddafi's genocide go unopposed, Hollywood gets to make another awesome movie like *Hotel Rwanda*!
0	1	It's funny how there's more pro-Gadaffi activity on reddit than in Libya. The man has exterminated a large chunk of his own people, nearly every Libyan has lost family members to his regime at this point. Countless women and children have been raped by his regime. And now he has threatened to murder innocent European civilians.   You people make me sick. While Libyans are sacrificing their lives in an attempt to get rid of this dictator and bring their country back to normality, you're just sitting in your fucking armchairs spouting conspiracy theories.  You give the left a bad name. 
1	4	XPOST response from lesser thread: "In response to his brutal attacks on rebels" , NATO is doing the same thing they did to Yugoslavia. A country is poised to upset the EU market and WHAM everyone starts dropping bombs calling it a humanitarian mission. This stuff is so blatantly obvious now since we got so much other stuff going on that we are not reacting to. People wonder why Iran wants Nukes? They want to be militarily off the table because they know whats going on. It's called free market imperialism and it's weapons are loans, sanctions and then bombs. Let Libya fight it's own civil war since both sides are ruthless, there are no good guys. If we succeed at ousting Gaddafi the country will be a shell and it's resources robbed and it's people disenfranchised.
0	3	He can't even carry out attacks in Benghazi any more.   Also, isn't this  bit of a shift from his claim to be protecting the world from terrorists like Al Qaeda?  Oh, why bother
-	-	And according to the Bosnian people the NATO campaign helped to prevent more atrocities such as the massacre at Srebrenica.
1	6	What are you talking about? Back when there was 24/7 rolling media coverage of the situation in Libya both BBC News and Al Jazeera constantly played videos of pro-Gadaffi rallies in Tripoli.
1	4	Upvote for a very informative 8 minutes, makes me want to check out the book and I'm usually pretty lazy. But its good to hear this information from horse's mouth about what our goals have been for so long. 
-	-	Wasnt that when he fired on HMS Cumberland, the artillery fell short, and in return Cumberland fired back and destroyed that posistion?
-	-	My favorite part about these conspiracy theories is just how US focused they are. Literally, the world revolves around the US level of obsession.  That a popular uprising could occur somewhere in the world without its fundamental cause being a US plot doesn't for a second enter the minds of some people. It's as if every Libyan wakes up in the morning and the first thought on their mind is America. 
1	4	Reddit isn't acting like anything, Gaddafi is a dictator who tried to use his nation's army against his own civilian population and then things went awry for him. It's his own fault. If he wanted Libya to thrive he would have abdicated immediately, but now he's gone too far.
-	-	Isn't Mr. Clark appointed to a government position now?
1	4	Watch.  The.  You Tube.  Link.  Do as he says, it's 8 minutes.  Please, you'll more than likely thank him for it.  It's not a pop bubble-gum, fostered-together-in-a-basement-link, it's US General  Wesley Clark at the Commonwealth Club of California courtesy of Fora.  I won't say what it says.  8 minutes.
-	-	Err European countries do have their own militaries capable of intervening, however their budgets were blown fighting useless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan started by a stupid American president supported by stupid American people. 
0	1	I would love to see Wesley Clark challenge Obama for the election. Can you even fucking imagine?
1	8	Sounds like an extraordinarily fast method of getting your entire military force bombed to piecies. Oh what's that libya, you sent a rocket that almost made it across the Mediterranean? I'm sorry, it's just that I can't hear you over how much your getting blasted into the stone age.
-	-	If you corner a wild animal, you should expect it to fight back.
-	-	* [Libya](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/patrick-cockburn-dont-believe-everything-you-see-and-read-about-gaddafi-2302830.html)   * [Libya](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article28365.htm)
-	-	If I remember correctly it did once. Long time ago though, almost a decade or so.
1	6	What do you propose? Stand idle and watch Gadaffi exterminate his own people? 
1	6	And yet we have a right to go and bomb these people? Why?   And talking about media news. http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/patrick-cockburn-lies-damn-lies-and-reports-of-battlefield-atrocities-2299701.html   
1	6	I am not talking about Nato bombing of Bosnia, but Nato bombing of Yugoslavia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_during_Operation_Allied_Force I am surprised how people talk about something without knowing essential facts. 
-	-	He doesn't want American to get their hands on Libyan oil. He wants money only for his people. 
-	-	The problem is, when he tried to use his nation's army against his own civilian population, how many foreign operatives were working in concert with these civilians?  The CIA, MI6, the French and Italian intelligence operatives are actually the ones orchestrating this movement.  It's not as cut and dry as you pretend.  Please watch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7NsXFnzJGw&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player
-	-	Yeah, only libya has the highest standard of living in africa, free health care, free education, cheap gas, and money derived from oil that went directly to the people's bank accounts....I'm sure NATO will provide a better standard of living, huh? idiot.
-	-	There are always two common strings:  1. The US is the most evil group of people in the world, and is secretly in charge of everything bad that happens anywhere.  2. The US can't pave its own roads or teach children to read at a high school level.   Seems legit. 
1	6	So does that surprise you? When somebody is attacked, he will defend with at least the same way it is being attacked.  And similar attacked have already happened before. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_73  And given the fact that now he is even more frustrated that ever, losing his family.  I won't call this mad, I would call this expected reaction. 
-	-	Yes, every time.   I can hardly wait to see the stupidity involved with this.

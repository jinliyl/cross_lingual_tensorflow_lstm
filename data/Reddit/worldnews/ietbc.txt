-	-	It's just a fact. If you are imagining that I am posting angrily, you are wrong. It's a fact and I'm stating it as a fact, just as I would if someone asked me who wrote Harry Potter. A woman called J K Rowling thought it of it and wrote it down in a coffee shop and now its a very popular story.  A missionary of fact is a... teacher? I guess that means you are calling me a teacher? I'm flattered, but I don't think that is a role I am looking for. I just point out inconstancies when I notice other people omitting the facts.
-	-	Calm down there, atheist missionary.
-	-	Something in Aramaic, probably.
1	4	that's, like, really deep, man.
-	-	&gt; Well, I thought that the Bible was God's word?   Good for you.  &gt; Picking and choosing which parts of the Bible you will adhere to and which parts you'll ignore makes no sense whatsoever. When you do that, you are basically saying that you know better than God.   Nonsense. Simply start from the premise that the origonal texts were inspired by truth but written by fallible men. Thus the entire bible whilst being "The word of God" is "The word of God as reported by people who can make mistakes". It's not saying you know better than God, it's saying you know better than some guy who lived almost 2000 years ago and had rudimentary knowledge of the world and human nature.  &gt; Not going to bother quoting the endless passages condemning homosexuals to death.   They're not endless. How many are there, 4? How high can you count?   &gt; You Christians need some consistency.  Did it ever occur to you that a Christian could have just answered the OP's point directly, rather than suggested he ask Christians in r/Christianity?  
1	4	You seemed to be confused about who decides what gods law is. You seemed to imply that such a mythical figure exists to write "his" own laws, but I'm informing you that such a mythical figure does not exist, and everything you have ever heard about any "god" was made up by ordinary people, just like you and me.
-	-	Sometimes the obvious things need to be said out loud. If they aren't said out loud often enough, the truth will seem scandalous or taboo. 
-	-	They made it up, so they can change the rules if they want to.
1	4	That's a very naive view of religion. Religion absolutely invloves heads deciding and debating what the rules are. They base them off holy texts and works of philosophy and theology, and "interpret" what is right and what Gods word is. No texts are perfect, they are all written by people, so the churches need to interpret and decide what to take note of, and what to disregard. Large parts of the bible have been written off as inaccurate or untrue by modern churches, whether it be because they are contradictory, or of questionable authenticity, or simply because the church thought they went against their traditional moral sense too much to be included. As time goes on, the values of the church and society changes and when something they took notice of becomes increasingly seen as archaic or immoral, they can disregard it with any number of justifications.  Thats not whats happening here though. God is one thing, but organised religion is man made. The church decided celibate gays can't be bishops, that rule is not written in the bible or anything like that, at least not the parts the Church of England has taken notice of in a long time, so its their prerogative to change it.
-	-	Of course they can decide what gods law is. The same way they decided the first time. Also for every revision since then.  I bet the original bible wasn't even the eternal and unchanging word of god. They probably put that into version 2.
1	4	&gt; I never understood, and probably will never understand, how Christians seem to think that they can just decide what God's law is.  Then go to r/Christianity and ask. There are lots of educated enthusiastic Christians there who could explain it to you.   &gt; I mean it's not like they ask God if it's okay when they "reform" their religion.  I'm pretty sure that's completely inaccurate. Praying for guidance is pretty much exactly that.
-	-	cake or death!
0	2	If I hated something and I had the chance to become head of that organisation , I would take the chance and drive the whole thing straight into the ground. Just sayin' ...
-	-	&gt; If someone can right off parts of a book while also claiming it to be the word of god how can i decide what is true?  Use your own judgement. This is why different churches exist in the first place, they interpreted it differently. As for the rest....I have no idea, you should ask a priest probably.
-	-	Nothing. He never existed.
-	-	I guess you missed what Puritanism was really about.
-	-	This guy be trolling, i've seen him on heaps of other threads, just ignore him.
-	-	Correct, don't know where the downvotes came from.
-	-	They are. And they aren't priests, that's papist. They are vicars, or possibly reverends. 
-	-	There is no god, so they made it all up. Everything you ever heard about god was just made up and anything you think about god either came from someone else who made it up or you made it up, because there is no god.
-	-	American Episcopalians.
-	-	Well, I thought that the Bible was God's word? Picking and choosing which parts of the Bible you will adhere to and which parts you'll ignore makes no sense whatsoever. When you do that, you are basically saying that you know better than God. Not going to bother quoting the endless passages condemning homosexuals to death. You Christians need some consistency.
1	6	&gt;I'm pretty sure that's completely inaccurate. Praying for guidance is pretty much exactly that.  What? Asking a question and waiting for an answer isn't the same thing as asking for something.
-	-	I bet they're doing it to piss off the Catholics and maybe win a few over in the process.
-	-	&gt; ...considering allowing *openly* gay clergy to be ordained  FTFY
1	4	I think it's good, people are people, all are equal 
-	-	As long as they remain celibate that is, a requirement that has long since been dropped for straight clergy.
-	-	as if homosexuals have any interest in leading churches after 2,000 years of churches condemning homosexuals to hell.
-	-	You must have tea and cake with the vicar...or you die!
-	-	Gay clergy already are bishops. Rooks are the ones that go straight.
1	6	What would jesus say!?
-	-	I don't understand why any gay person would want so desperately to be associated with the church of england or any organised religion after all the condemnation of the gay lifestyle over the years.
1	4	I never understood, and probably will never understand, how Christians seem to think that they can just decide what God's law is. I mean it's not like they ask God if it's okay when they "reform" their religion.
1	4	Actually the real problem seems to be the alternative. There is a split down the middle of the CoE. It is more likely it will split in half and the "conservative" half will rejoin the Catholics.
1	8	If someone can right off parts of a book while also claiming it to be the word of god how can i decide what is true?  Sure an all knowing god would be able explain clearly and explain what to do in our ever changing world.  A part from that- for me- there is also the problem, that why would a god create rules if (as an all knowing god) he knows people are going to break them? Wouldn't he go on to explain further why I'm not allowed to commit these things? Or try to change the future? Why would he create me if he already knows in the future he isn't going to want me? Why send me to hell when you can just decide not to create me?   Then, lets say, you really give us 'free will' (as some christians argue) why create your book in the first place? Why create rules if you allow me to do anything? Why allow me to walk but no fly? What type of superfiscal person creates something to worship themselves? (especially when they already know they are the greatest thing that exists) Then condemn them to an eternity without 'god' if you don't worship him? Why create that choice? I'm sorry but there is too many questions. Why create rich/poor/powerful/weak when you are the greatest? 
-	-	This would definitely earn a gold star from r/atheism :)
0	1	You know priests are fucking little boys when their sexual orientation is relevant even in a context of claimed sexual abstinence.
-	-	These periodic policy-change moves by churches just underlines how lacking they are as regards true principles.  They blow with the political and public opinion winds of the day.   Sadly, they are run by mere men and it's very obvious: their strategies have more to do with wooing people into their congregations and fighting against their often dwindling numbers, than pursuing any pious way of life. If I believed in their god I certainly wouldn't have anything to do with them other than maybe asking god to have mercy on them!
-	-	I was under the impression that they already allowed that? Or is that the Scottish Presbyterians?
-	-	In other news: the KKK is now allowing black people to join, but only if they paint their faces white.
-	-	because they can't find enough straight people who want do to the studies and live the life?  
1	6	What happened to the sexually repressed England we all used to know and love?
1	6	It is a fact and I do know it. This may surprise you, but there is no evidence at all for the existence of deities. Like NO evidence, not even a single bit of evidence, none at all.
1	4	I think it's quite divisive. I think they could possibly loose members on balance, with quite a few people particularly from the high church of England going back into the Catholic fold.  The higher ends of the Church of England are very close to the Catholic church in much of it's style and ceremony except no Pope and priests are allowed to be married. Whereas the lower end is much more like Protestantism in a truer Lutherian sense. More akin to the Protestantism seen on the European continent, but also in Scotland and Northern Ireland.  The Pope has already been "courting" sections of the Church of England that are opposed to gay clergy, offering to bring them in, but allowed to retain much of their Anglican tradition.   
1	4	Disgusting.  No wonder the Anglican membership is dropping like a rock.
-	-	And hell, for a church (at least in the popular belief) essentially founded so that Henry VIII could divorce a buncha ladies, they don't really have the moral authority to be hoity toity about it. It's only consistent.
-	-	I believe CofE clergy are, in fact, allowed to marry.
-	-	Priests, yes.  Not bishops.
-	-	The Kirk (Church of Scotland) just implemented it.  There is already several congregations breaking off in protest to either form independent churches or going the whole hog and switching to Catholicism.  Its just the death throws of a group that has seen declining numbers for decades so now that they are practically dead they are opening up their club to all the people they used to love bashing and preached about how they are sinners etc. etc. etc.  Wont be long until they end up letting atheists in at the rate they are going.
-	-	It's common for Christians to pray for help in choosing the right decision. In this case it's very much the same thing as them asking God "Is this the right thing do to?"
-	-	It's important to remember the Pope is the head of the *Roman* Catholic church. The Anglican church considers itself, in the doctrinal sense, a Catholic church which is protestant of the Pope.  But you're right that there are churches all along the "Catholic-Protestant" spectrum in the Church of England and the Episcopal church. 
-	-	Either that or the general public is tired of listening to fairy tales and playing make-believe.
-	-	Britain has never really been about that. In fact surveys regularly show Brits have far more sex than most European nations. The real difference is we're a bit more private about it.
-	-	They all left to found America.
-	-	Just calm down, atheist missionary.
-	-	This is true, when Canada allowed same sex marriage parts of the anglican community mainly in the developing world(Africa, Asia south America) wanted the Canadian anglican church to be disowned if it backed same sex marriage.  The heads of the church of England never gave official word either way. So the Canadian leaders left it up the individual ministers to make the call.  In areas of the world where the church is still growing or showing a strong backing they run the risk of pushing their support to catholicism.
-	-	If they hear a voice in reply, they may need to seek medical advice.
1	4	I'm an atheist just like you but it's simply untrue to call it a fact. You don't know, so don't pretend, that's what the theists do.
1	6	damn right man, agree with every word. anyone who is delusional enough to ignore the history/facts deserves to be made a fool of. I used to be Muslim and Islam is pretty explicit on the subject, homosexuality=wrong.  What kind of a masochist would have to be to want so desperately to subscribe that sort of institution?

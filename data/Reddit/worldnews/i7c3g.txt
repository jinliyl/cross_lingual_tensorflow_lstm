-	-	Well... no. Not really. While a mob of football fans might be annoying, I've never, ever had any problems with them or the stray alcohol-drinking passenger or smallish group. Myself included. People asocial enough to smoke piss me off way more, and I say that as a smoker.  Heck what's wrong with drinking a beer on the way home after a concert, to replenish calories?  It's a political thing. The Hochbahn, the metro operators, [said in November](http://www.hochbahn.de/wps/portal/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hAT1NnU09LYwN3fz8DAyO3MGcX19AQAwN_c_2CbEdFAFUR19k!/?WCM_PORTLET=PC_7_QI5C5I930GON002FVCDEUT00U4000000_WCM&amp;WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/de/home/hochbahn/presse/Artikeluebersicht/pm_alkoholverbot) that they aren't planning on a ban because there's just no negative directly alcohol-related experiences. They already *can* kick out douchebags, drunken or not, without needlessly harrassing peaceful people enjoying a beer after work.

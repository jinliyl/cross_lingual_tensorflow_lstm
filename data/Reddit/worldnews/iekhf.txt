-	-	You're White Knighting pretty hard, mate. False rape accusations *are* a problem. So is genuine rape.  Let's wait and see what happens with the physical evidence.
1	4	I like this quote because it's the truth.  My problem is that many innocent men have their lives ruined by false accusations.  Why do you support evil liars?

1	4	Thanks for that link. This makes it seem much more likely that he indeed raped her.  What makes me doubt her side is [this](http://mobile.nytimes.com/article?a=811746&amp;single=1&amp;f=22):  &gt;When the conversation was translated - a job completed only this Wednesday - investigators were alarmed: "She says words to the effect of, 'Don't worry, this guy has a lot of money. I know what I'm doing,' " the official said.  Or her bank records.  Very difficult to tell what happened from the outside.
-	-	WTF is vaginal bruising?  Did he punch her in the twat?
-	-	Nevertheless, it can't be denied that the accuser is a serial liar. Many women [lie about rape](http://falserapesociety.blogspot.com/p/prevalence-of-false-rape-claims.html).   &gt;As reported by "False Rape Allegations" by Eugene Kanin, Archives of Sexual Behavior Feb 1994 v23 n1 p81 (12), Professor Kanin’s major study of a mid-size Midwestern U.S. city over the course of nine years found that 41 percent of all rape claims were false. Kanin also studied the police records of two unnamed large state universities, and found that in three years, 50 percent of the 64 rapes reported to campus police were determined to be false, without the use of polygraphs. (Kanin, incidentally, was a feminist icon whose work was cited and relied on without question by feminists, including the infamous Koss Report.  He suddenly became a nitwit who forgot how to do research when his studies upset the narrative of the persons who dominate the public discourse about rape.)   &gt;In addition, a landmark Air Force study in 1985 studied 556 rape allegations. It found that 27% of the accusers recanted, and an independent evaluation revealed a false accusation rate of 60%. McDowell, Charles P., Ph.D. “False Allegations.” Forensic Science Digest, (publication of the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations), Vol. 11, No. 4 (December 1985), p. 64. See also, "Until Proven Innocent," the widely praised (praised even by the New York Times, which the book skewers -- as well as by most other major U.S. news sources) and painstaking study of the Duke Lacrosse non-rape case. Authors Stuart Taylor and Professor K.C. Johnson explain that the exact number of false claims is elusive but "[t]he standard assertion by feminists that only 2 percent" or sexual assault claims "are false, which traces to Susan Brownmiller's 1975 book 'Against Our Will,' is without empirical foundation and belied by a wealth of empirical data. These data suggest that at least 9 percent and probably closer to half" of all sexual assault claims "are false . . . ." (Page 374.)   
-	-	&gt;[Thompson] said that Strauss-Kahn ripped the woman's pantyhose, tore a ligament in her shoulder and grabbed her so hard that he caused visible bruising on her vagina.     *and*   &gt;The woman said that Strauss-Kahn forced her to perform oral sex, after which Thompson said she crawled away from Strauss-Kahn, and as she was fleeing, she spit his semen on the floor and wall of the hotel suite.  .  That's pretty damned rough for a mid-afternoon quickie with the maid. There's problems with her account, but those forensics don't exactly scream "consensual".
-	-	Apparently, he grabbed her there, hard.   The details will have to wait for the trial.     It's not just 'he said / she said'.
-	-	that man beat the pussy up! 
1	6	You really love this quote,  don't you?  you cited it twelve times in less than twenty four hours in various subreddit.    What's your problem dude?   Besides,  citing Kanin who has long been discredited might not be the strongest argument you could make to support a fellow perv.  
-	-	Yes.  They both have ugly histories, so it's going to come down to forensics.
-	-	Some people have consensual sex this way.
-	-	I have to admit, I have not been keeping up with the case. Only the initial charge, and today's update.  Perhaps I should STFU. and read. :)

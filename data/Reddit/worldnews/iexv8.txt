-	-	Might be a silly question, but is there real evidence of him saying this?
1	4	I wouldn't discount this completely.  Israel, only a couple of days ago was insisting they wanted armed agents in all European airports.  I don't particularly like Israel, but you can't spit anywhere in the world without the Mossad knowing about it.  Whether it's Gaddafi or some other threat, my bet is that something is brewing in Europe.
-	-	Go for it, you're ships won't even make it out of port and your planes won't even make it across the mediterranean.
1	4	It almost seems like his top advisers are CIA agents. How convenient that after the US starts to show signs of disinterest in continuing this campaign, he threatens to take the war outside of Libya's borders. He has had a long time to make threats like this, why now? 
1	4	Sounds like a great set-up for a false flag attack.
1	4	yeah, this was a good idea.
-	-	"Come at me bro" ?
1	6	Just a thought. What if he has allies that we don't know of yet?
-	-	To be fair, Europe is striking him.  Jus sayin.
-	-	So is the EU now trying to justify a Patriot Act equivalent or what?
-	-	That would be clever, an act of war on the members of NATO - 28 countries whose leaders can't wait for Gadaffi to be thrown out of power. 
-	-	That's a retarded idea. If it happens (i hope not) this will give the EU excuse it needs to send troops. 
-	-	Him and what army?
1	4	More like *our* planes won't even make it across Scotland.
-	-	The only evidence we have is the press, and frankly that scares the Hell out of me.
0	3	Maybe that were only rummors, but it has been said he supplied explosives to terrorists (IRA) and he also bombed a plane. NATO is probably too afraid to let him survive that conflict and they are anxious for an excuse (like an act of war) to roll in the tanks. 
-	-	He has made attacks on the West in the past though, I do think it is possible for him to do so again.
-	-	no one is so stupid... they only reason china and russia abstained from the vote on the UN resolution was to show that the US/europe doesn't have complete hegemony.
0	1	"Fuck it! We're taking Greenland!"
-	-	Get stung by a bee, kill the hive.  Seriously, who does he think he is to make these threats?
-	-	his **bees** will blot out the sun
0	3	Gaddafi really is a [terrorist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103) and a brutally oppressive dictator.  The "powers that be" don't need to set him up as anything.  What made Bin Laden an effective boogeyman is that nobody knew where he was or what he was up to.  Gaddafi is nothing like that.
-	-	they have very powerful slingshots!
-	-	this .. IS ..... **LIBYA!!!**
-	-	He'll just take fifty catapults, send them all on suicide runs into Paris, then walk in with a bunch of archers.
1	6	What kind of crack are you smoking?
-	-	wouldn't be a bloodbath, but do not want this.
-	-	As opposed to what exactly? 
1	4	happy birthday!  
-	-	Um, no offense intended but I can't understand your English. The only ones that are prevalent are ones from African nations that are hired by Gaddafi. If that is what you mean than no but if not, I could use a little translation.
1	6	What do you call a person who's a member of the armed forces? I call them a soldier. I, as well as many other people, refer to multiple soldiers as "troops." What do you call it when a soldier has his feet on terra firma? I call that a troop on the ground. What do you call it when you have multiple troops with their feet on solid ground within the borders Libya? Troops on the ground in Libya. Doesn't matter if war were declared or not. Technicalities only count in sports and politics. Everything else needs to depend on that pesky thing called "the real world."
-	-	&gt;In Al Bayda and Az Zintan, hundreds of protesters called for "the end of the regime" and set fire to police and security buildings.  You're right. The rebels started the war.
-	-	It was a front page article on World News a couple of days ago. Let me hunt for this.
1	4	&gt; It was not immediately clear whether Gaddafi could make good on such threats.  Haha
0	1	He will strike at us **LIKE BEES!!!**  Holy fuck, I hate bees!
1	8	Hey, you're the one who thinks the Cold War should have heated up over a completely legal loophole and you can't seem to get the difference between a military adviser and active combatant in terms of the rules of war. Hippy reddit folk who run around and can't comprehend the rules of war should only speak when spoken to. To put it in really simple terms, Military advisers are not recognized as active combatants in war and their legality in terms of combat is that of an adviser. As long as they don't take up arms against the enemy they might as well be considered accountants and taxidermists. I pity the soul that has to explain to you what the rules of engagement are for Soldiers that are part of a nation's army and people for private military companies.
1	4	you did not, my bad.     i see one big problem with "push the tanks in and it would be over in a week" i assume u meant, right from the start. if not, ignore what im about to write.  if the NATO pushed for an armed intervention (with troops, tanks and so on) do you think the majority of the arabian (muslim) people would think of it as "help"?   there is a real risk that the extremists would use it as just another reason to rally the people against the western Countrys, getting more and more to join their ranks.  dont get me wrong, i'd like to see the NATO to help Lybia, but (and thats a big but) i would want them to help Syria, Bahrain, Somalia too. and the list goes on and on...
-	-	So let us support the rebels then 
0	5	yeah butthurt much.  and dont forget saddam had nukes too.
0	5	i was just comparing the  "Jews/America/Zionism did 9/11 and ovaltine/flu shots is way for america" comment with even more silly story of saddam having nuclear weapons. gadaffi? did i say anything about gadaffi having nukes?  your just being a nigger.  your shitt comments are not worth being on dramtic fanatic whtaever
-	-	;) Racist and you can't speak English. Impressive.
1	4	Gadaffi has never had nukes, nor has he ever had nukes, [In fact he allowed in inspectors to destroy his WMD's and there were no nukes reported.](http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2006_05/Libya) but thank you for donating material to Encyclopedia Dramatica and making redditors look sillier in general. Remember, never let fact, spamming silliness and butthurt  ever get in the way of making you look like a twat.
1	4	&gt; if the NATO pushed for an armed intervention (with troops, tanks and so on) do you think the majority of the arabian (muslim) people would think of it as "help"?  It matters what Libyans would think, not what other Arabs would. And judging by what I've seen on Al Jazeera they were pretty happy the planes saved them in Benghazi. Occupation like that in Iraq wouldn't please them, but a contingent of tanks could probably push the stalemate and end very costly air operations. They need to do another 1991 Iraq, rebel infantry can do the rest.   &gt; there is a real risk that the extremists would use it as just another reason to rally the people against the western Countrys, getting more and more to join their ranks.  You're completely right, a big worry is that they would create another Iraq or Afghanistan. Another is probably deaths of NATO soldiers which carry bigger political implications than deaths of other people, also demonstrated in Iraq and Afghanistan. Foreign occupation gives legitimacy to local opportunist resistance leaders that otherwise wouldn't get podium to rally their countrymen. Limited intervention would probably be welcomed by Libyans and would not lead to civil war as their culture is different than that of Afghanistan or Iraq because they are, like Tunisians, less religious or radicalized, however like you said you can never be sure that someone would not grab an opportunity to radicalize the population under foreign occupation.   &gt; i would want them to help Syria, Bahrain, Somalia too. and the list goes on and on...  Right. 
0	3	I read that Gaddafi has fallen out of favor of some terrorist groups because he tried cracking down on them within the last decade to strengthen relations with the West.
1	4	Exactly.  Its not like he hasn't done it before.
-	-	Well he's already under attack, I guess he doesn't want to go down without a fight.
-	-	I guess he figures that if they want him gone anyway, he'll make them pay for it.  Either that or he's just posturing.
-	-	Yeah the only real result of it would be to lift the restrictions NATO have. We could at that point just send 100k soldiers in and remove him more directly.
-	-	http://www.obamaslibya.com/
-	-	whoops, didn't see this 0.o clumsy repost on my part.
-	-	Bread helmet at the ready
-	-	If he does it, he should focus on killing our politicians, who started this war.
-	-	they are allready at war, just shitty nato propaganda calls it "no fly zone" ect.
1	4	beats me, it's not like he's becoming increasingly desperate or anything.
-	-	I love how you attribute superhuman powers to the CIA. 
-	-	If he targets military installations, legit. If he targets civilians, war crime.
-	-	**NSFW**
-	-	A ground war in Libya would be an absolute bloodbath.  Do not want this.
-	-	we already have them nearby!
0	3	Aside from a terrorist campaign he doesn't have the means to make NATO pay for anything.
-	-	[Incorrect.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2011_Libyan_civil_war#Early_phase_.2815.E2.80.9326_February.29) 
-	-	indeed.
-	-	I'd love a source on this. 
0	3	You guys are being naive here. Gaddafi can sponsor terrorist groups
0	3	I didn't get the impressions it was a direct threat. More of a "Your actions will create future terrorists who will seek revenge."  He said something about attacks on offices etc would be justified because they've suffered similar attacks.
-	-	&gt; wouldn't it be better if he's put on trial?  I don't believe I said I was against the trial.   If you thought that by 'tanks rolling in' I meant I wanted him to die then you are wrong as I meant that if they pushed the tanks in the whole operation would be ended in less than a week with fraction of the costs or casualties.   The present status quo is less humanitarian as both sides are more or less matched and so are able to annihilate each other piece by piece, while if superior ground force was introduced then large portions of Qaddafi forces could be surrounded by so called pincer movements that would result in less deaths than if the civil war was allowed to continue. Civil wars can be pretty bloody.  
0	1	I'm sorry, but you're a fucking idiot.
-	-	That's why it's scary.
-	-	Because he's crazy? Have you heard his incoherent mumbling speeches? You wouldn't want him to shoot down another plane, and he might just do it if he got a chance. He bombed the last plane as a revenge for few armed conflicts they had with US and he supplied IRA to get revenge on British. We've avoken a sleeping tiger, there's no other option but to put it down. 
-	-	butthurt much? the "flown in hired soliders" were in reallity a cover for the vestern sponsored throops that was flown inthere.  just later did they admit that "guides" helped the rebels 
-	-	Ya. After 40 years of oppression. 
-	-	hmm, you got me wrong. shouldn't have written "anyone", if i mean the NATO.     wouldn't it be better if he's put on trial?
1	4	Well like I said earlier, if we are going to use your standards of having troops on the ground (Non-direct participants who advise in combat) then we would all be nuclear dust from the Soviets retaliating against us in the 80's or the United States retaliating in the 50's and 60's when the Soviets advised the Koreans and Vietnamese. Luckily since the rest of the world doesn't go by your standards, having advisors is not internationally known as having "troops on the ground". They become troops on the ground when the advisors actively and consistently participate in combat. In this case the political technicality becomes a part of the real world.
1	4	Oh thissssss type of thread. Jews/America/Zionism did 9/11 and ovaltine/flu shots is way for america to control minds, Alluh Ackbar!  Edit-To be fair and to give this thread one last wink a a nod of seriousness before I consider this thread Encyclopedia Dramatica fodder (http://encyclopediadramatica.ch/Reddit#Arab_Apologists). [I highly doubt that the U.S special forces are based in Mali.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12647115)  Other Edit-I know it sounds like I'm being mean man but I seriously can't get your English, the wording sounds like it was done by the people who spam out Ukranian porn.
-	-	oppression sponsored by nato.  i never saw a "wont sell weapons becouse of brutal regime"
1	4	This may be highly inappropriate comparison, but did anyone else think of the "broken" A.I.  in games like CivIII where the utterly outmatched and out gunned nation makes bold demands and threatens to strike full force in a most unrealistic way?  Turns out reality is unrealistic.
-	-	Nuke everything.
-	-	i really wish he would, so the entirety of NATO can release the kraken
-	-	If he tries it then he'll be signing his own death warrant. Frankly, I think the powers that be are just trying to set him up as the next Bin Laden.
-	-	Somehow i am not frightened...  That guy is a Clown. There are plenty Dictators in History who where not able to see reality untill the bitter end. 
1	4	"Gaddafi spoke from an unknown location in a likely sign of concern over his safety"  Yea thats pretty likely.
-	-	&gt;Addressing the West, he warned that Libyans might take revenge for Nato bombings.  The people are to take the repercussions when Obama didn't even go through congress.
-	-	lol
-	-	Somewhat reminds me of what that jap admiral said, "im afraid we have awakened a sleeping tiger".  Europes got a LOT of potential military power.
-	-	O.o I could have sworn that said "Greece threatens to strike Europe". Weird.
-	-	As in soon to be disappeared off of the face of the planet?
-	-	I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords.
-	-	That’s it, I got it, this man is called The Green Bee.
-	-	...an army [of BEES!!](http://almostdumb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/how-long-do-you-think-it-would-take-to-train-an-army-of-bees.jpg)
-	-	Beads?
1	4	Sounds like Qaddafi's [been watching Oprah](http://i.imgur.com/L4SHC.gif).
-	-	Oh, Gaddafi. You so crazy.
-	-	They don't need an excuse. Several western nations already have troops on the ground in Libya.
-	-	He's quickly running out of money, even the mercs he has in Libya are starting to miss paychecks.
-	-	Wonder if he sponsored the walk for the cure that happened a while ago.  Good man or best man?
-	-	come at me, bro!
-	-	This would be writing a blank check for every nation involved in this, especially the US. 
-	-	&gt;"Instead of issuing threats, he should be putting the well-being and interests of his own people first. He should step down from power."  I guess Hillary is more retarded than I thought. 
-	-	Oh and don't forget the [La Belle bombing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_Berlin_discotheque_bombing) and [UTA Flight 772](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTA_Flight_772#Trial_in_absentia)...
-	-	If spears can defeat tanks...
-	-	Slingshot v. cruise missiles...it's super effective!
-	-	Then we will fight in the shade...
-	-	or dogs? or dogs with bees in their mouth so that when the bark they shoot bees at you?
-	-	By your definition we were declaring open war on the Soviets in Afghanistan by having our guys advise them on the ground in their war in the 80's. Judging by the fact that I'm typing this and not running around fighting radioactive beasts, Fallout style, I'd say that technically we don't have "troops on the ground".
-	-	They have military advisors and very small squads training troops.  Not an occupation force.  There's a difference.  The Libyan rebels specifically said that they will fight foreign troops should an occupation force land in Libya.  They're not unaware of possible ulterior motives from NATO countries but appreciate the help.
-	-	you mean the merc that was flown in? that prooved to be the opposite and was western supported merchenaries?
-	-	well he did that stuff in the past... and if you believe al jazeera (engl.) he hired thugs from other countrys to beat up his own people.  but why would anyone be "afraid" to let him life? 
0	3	I really doubt he has a lot to spare when he is fighting a civil war. Anything is possible, but how likely is it? Sounds like unnecessary fear to me.

-	-	Nothing wrong with that. 
-	-	Where I live probably 1 out of 5 cars has some sort of confederate flag sticker, license plate cover..etc.   This just doesn't seem to be that big of a deal to me, I guess I've just gotten used to it.
0	2	So does this mean you think it's related to racism, violence, and succeeding from the north? Honestly, I'm originally from ohio, moved to Texas, and it would be cool to have a confederate flag license plate. At this point it's more of a homage to the past than directly related to the war.   No one bitches about the confederate flag on the general lee, why would a tiny one on a license plate matter? 
1	6	Those who equate the "Confederate" flag (not actually the official flag of the Confederacy) with racism are displaying their ignorance of history and/or their propagandizing of the modern system. The civil war was first and foremost about state's rights.   If slavery was the prime or sole mover in the war, why did some slave states not ever secede? Why did others in the northern Confederacy only secede after the North attacked the South?  Finally, Mr. Shelton displays an appalling lack of historical knowledge when he declaims that the Confederacy wanted to destroy the current governmental structure. The United States federal government was formed by individual states who agreed that it was in their best interests to work together. They voluntarily banded together.   Later the Southern states felt that it was no longer in their best interests and chose to voluntarily leave the association. At that point it ceased to be voluntary and the US government turned into the world's biggest gang - once in, never out.  History - it only works if you know it. Both the poster and Mr. Shelton are displaying their ignorance. To better understand what happened and how we should react to it, look not to the Civil War but the negotiations over the formation of the Consitution and the fight to get it ratified.

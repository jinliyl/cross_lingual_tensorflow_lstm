-	-	that was in the past.  both iran and venezuela need oil prices above $95 per barrel to cover the cost of social programs enacted in the past couple of years.  here is more info:  [link](http://www.tnr.com/article/environment-and-energy/88415/iraq-oil-gas-prices-united-states-opec)  From the article:   Aiding the Iranian nuclear effort has been the spike in oil prices. About half of Iran’s state revenue derives from oil exports, and because international sanctions and other factors have caused its oil production to decline about 17 percent over the last three years, it can only increase revenue through higher oil prices. No single non-military factor would likely limit Iran’s revenue and therefore hinder its nuclear program as much as low oil prices.
-	-	That is my armchair expert opinion, yes. They have promised increases that never occurred.
0	2	I hate when submitted articles are behind paywalls.  
-	-	Paywall
-	-	One thing that people need to understand is that not all oil is the same. Oil differs by density (lightness) and sulphur content (sweetness). Iran has quite light, sweet crude oil, which is in higher demand than Saudi Arabia's heavy, bitter crude. In places like western Europe, some of their refineries can't even handle the shittier-quality oil coming from Saudi, because Europe has stringent regulations.   This is why Saudi Arabia can never replace Iran completely as an oil producing nation.   This is also why Libya is getting fucked up right now. They have very good oil. Some of the best oil in the world comes from Nigeria. Look for a war there soon
1	4	pay to read more....  No thankyou... Does this even work in this day and age
0	2	It's a bluff. They don't actually have that capacity.
-	-	Reminds me of dune
1	4	That's a cute threat and all, but they don't have any excess capacity to flood out Iran. If they had excess capacity we wouldn't be tapping into strategic reserves right now.

0	1	How is possible that you're all so retarded that you haven't figured out you can:  [Google the title](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Saudi+Suggests+%27Squeezing%27+Iran+Over+Nuclear+Ambitions)  And click on the first link?  Why on every fucking WSJ do derpers gotta derp?
-	-	Except demand for oil is already so great that no matter how much they produce, iran will always have markets to sell theirs to.  
-	-	The Saudis could crash the price of oil by opening the taps. I rember the goood old days of the late '90s when all of OPEC were cutting each other's throats by cheating on their production quotas and oil was $14/bbl. Then they got their act together and set a target of $25/bbl, with a range of $22-28/bbl. It actually worked for the short time before other events intervened.
1	6	&gt; Does this even work in this day and age  Err... yes? The WSJ typically has very high quality articles. Quality is worth paying for.  And even if you don't understand that point, they have many thousands of subscribers.
1	8	it is not about having markets to sell to, it is about dropping the bottom out of the price of oil.  iran is pretty financially strapped and the only thing keeping things calm at home for them is the price of oil being so high lately.  if oil prices fall deeply, iran will have to cut many services domestically which will erode support for the government from a population that is barely supporting it now.
1	4	That link doesn't work for me, I get the same two and a half sentences.  Don't get me wrong, thanks for taking the time to offer it, I just think that WSJ links should be in their own subreddit, and I'm using your comment as a place to rant.  I've deleted my cookies, cleared my cache, used a different browser, switched IP's, and searched for the headline on google. I've done this in other threads were people claim they have a working link, as well. Maybe the WSJ have my computer fingerprinted as an undesirable.   The only option working option I can think of is for someone to copy/paste the article into the thread, but I guess the WSJ would get choked if someone fixed their broken piece of the internet for them in such a way.  
-	-	The search for the headline should work (it worked for me on this article). The only time that I know of where it fails is if you use https for google searches. 
-	-	They can't. They're lying about their capacity. That was over a decade ago when consumption was lower.
-	-	When price was really low iran was doing fine. America and Europe are experiencing more troubling economic downturns.

1	6	I'm certainly no expert but do you really think Saudi is pumping at full capacity now? I ask because I don't know, and appreciate informed opinion, which I am not.

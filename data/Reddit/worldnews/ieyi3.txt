0	3	Dude, you still won't get shot for looking at a soldier the wrong way if you live in Cuba, while in Afghanistan they'll kill you and say you're a Taliban terrorist. 
-	-	Interesting how the article mentions that the last political prisoner in Cuba was jailed in 2003 and released this year.  In other words, no there aren't any political prisoners in Cuba, *by this own article's admission*.
0	3	Gaza is in bad shape. But places under Nazi Germany were in far worse shape than any place on the list (excluding perhaps North Korea).  Therefore, the fact Gaza is not on the list is indication that at the very least, Gaza is nowhere near the horrors being maliciously ascribed to it by the anti-Israeli crowd. 
1	4	A siege makes them Israeli slaves?  Nice to know words mean nothing except what the anti-Israelis want them to mean at a given moment.  Gaza gets about 6000 tons in ~220 truckloads of **daily** shipments. The Palestinian leadership in Gaza fails to order enough to fill the entirety of the truckloads, so they come not completely full.  Israel isn't even the bottleneck on the entry of goods to Gaza.  Gaza's residents can actually travel in and out through Egypt.  Basically every single point in your comment is false.
-	-	Exactly my point. 
-	-	&gt; The royal family uses its immense wealth to hold power instead of violence  they do use plenty of brutal violence, especially against the Shia's in the East. they're even exporting it to other places.  I mean, you simply cannot compare that shithole to China or Belarus or even Libya. this list is (almost) pure propaganda. 
-	-	This is obviously due to his repressive government.
-	-	Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
-	-	Read the document, Freedom House agrees that those countries aren't free.
-	-	Yes, it is. This is especially suprising considering the topic is "freedom" - hardly something that can be measured objectively. At some point in the equation you're going to have to make value judgements.   For example, which is more important to "freedom" - the ability to read anything you want, or the ability to say anything you want?   Your answer is going to be biased. 
-	-	So countries with no prisons are freer than Norway, right?
1	4	Probably Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, &amp;c. - places where implied or constitutional rights are unlikely to be impinged.
-	-	The military are pretty much in charge. There is talk of torture bases being set up again.
-	-	I bet this article don't account of economic freedom. Sure you are free to dig anywhere for food... It's all political. I would trade a fat pay cheque for voting rights any time. They need to satisfy their basic needs first. 
-	-	The [regular news from Zimbabwe](http://zimbabwesituation.com/index.html) tells me that things aren't really getting better. 
-	-	That would be freedom for the individual to do as they please, without harming others of course.
-	-	I'm guessing you haven't lived in many countries.
-	-	Somalia is an anarchy and North Korea is a totalitarian dictatorship operating under the guise of communism. The U.S. has been locked in a permanent civil rights dispute for almost its entire history and has a poor reputation for trying, with widely varying results, to impose order beyond its national borders. I think you should put a bit more thought into this.
-	-	The United States does have rather liberal 'free speech' rights. Unfortunately the US doesn't have laws governing grammar online.
-	-	But you can love that ring
-	-	All my upvotes.
-	-	It's our government that needs to leave, not me
-	-	I almost warfed when I realized what those were on the stretchers in the Syria picture.
-	-	Hmmm, the way I hear libertarians cry bloody murder all the time, I thought the US would be on there.
-	-	"If you think you're free, there's no escape possible."   Dass, Ram 
-	-	Sweet.  A bunch of places I wasn't ever going to visit in the first place.  
1	4	I read "The Last Free Places..."  i started reading, scrolling around, and i was like, wtf?
-	-	Damn nature, you scary.
1	4	I live in China and I have to say it's not even half as bad as its made out to be. I have a very normal life and can use Facebook, Skype, Reddit, any foreign press website, as do chinese people. Its not very fair to compare China to the likes of Turkmenistan and North Korea. Also this list seems badly put together, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and a host of small sub saharan countries ruled by violent military dictatorships are missed out, probably too small, insignificant and underroported for this magazine to care. 'Freedom' is a concept made by Americans to look down their noses at the rest of the world. People from no other country place a high value on this vague word. America is not even really free in many ways. They don't have a very 'free' political system where parties represent each part of the political spectrum. Rant over
-	-	I practice the Burmese left-pocket-with-right-hand maneuver even though I am free to not do this here in America.
1	4	The difference between what really happens to what people think happens...  It's a great point- a lot of "human rights" activists are focusing on Gaza, though they can do a lot more good other places. It's not a human right issue, it's a political issue. 
-	-	So, Wisconsin's tyrannical Walker regime didn't make it... that's odd. 
-	-	To clarify for all the folks in here: this list clearly has very heavy weight toward the ability to have an election and be represented. It doesn't seem to have nearly as much weight as to other rights for the people in an area. The one thing in common about the people on the list is that they either do not have elections or have elections that are clearly a farce.
1	4	In that respect Reddit is just like the UNHRC. Reality vs making America look bad.
-	-	zimbabwe?
1	4	Fun fact majority of this places are active members of UN human right counsel 
-	-	Freedom House receives about 80% of its budget from the U.S. government. [Link](http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/special_report/72.pdf). 
-	-	All a little obvious, what about places such as Saipan, which could greatly benefit from attention? Most Americans aren't aware their leaders directly support a system so antithetical to proclaimed American ideals. Everyone knows about the situation in Tibet, but there is unfortunately little to be done.  TL;DR If you're American tell your senator and representative you want change in Saipan and the United States Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands!
-	-	&gt;non biased organization  "Tell me, honestly: Are you really the one person who can step outside every culture, every belief system, every source of bias and confusion, and see the truth?"   She nodded unassumingly. "Of course I am. Aren't you?"      Greg Egan, *Distress*
-	-	I went on vacation to Laos, it was very nice.
-	-	You are profoundly stupid if you think that single measurement is completely indicative of how "less free" a country is.   Oh, but wait, America tops the list. Derp, you're right. America is the least free country in the entire world! Absolutely no propaganda and sophistry here!
-	-	According to your source, the nations of Zimbabwe, Uganda, Niger, Ethiopia, Egypt, Turkmenistan, Sudan, Comoros and Uae have **0 per 100,000** people incarcerated.   Clearly the American propaganda machine has pulled the wool over everyone's eyes. These places aren't repressive at all!
1	8	Damn, the USA is also the least happy [according to one poll](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/06/north-korea-global-happiness-index-china-happiest-place_n_871784.html). Sorry to hear Americans, hope your country does better in the future!
-	-	deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrp
-	-	You don't get shot or detained for life just for speaking out against the government in the US.  Use your head, moron.
-	-	Do you practice being a complete douche, or does it just come naturally?
-	-	I actually came here half expecting to see America on the list.  Y'know, since it's reddit and all.
1	4	Ok lets take Cuba:  Literacy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_literacy_rate [Cuba 2nd, US 21st]  Infant Mortality http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_mortality_rate [Cuba 28th, US 33rd]  Life Expectancy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy [Cuba and US joint 36th]  Environmental Performance Index http://epi.yale.edu/Countries [Cuba 9th, US 61st]  Happy Planet Index http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Planet_Index [Cuba 7th, US 150th]  GDP http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29 [US 1st, Cuba 68th]   Not everything is great in Cuba but living in a country with enormous natural resources per capita you have no right to be so condescending to a country that has managed so much against the backdrop of US funded death-squads, assassination and CIA coups in all of it's neighbours.
-	-	They forgot suburbia because parents just don't understand. 
-	-	what?! are you serious?  I can not believe Iran is not on there, where they recently had what looks to almost certainly be a stolen, fraudulent election. Where they block satellite TV, arrest women for wearing to much makeup or showing their ankles, ban all non-traditional music and magazines, the list goes on. iran restricts entertainment so much that they are being crippled by cheap Afghan heroin, 20% of their 72 million people take drugs &amp; 600,000 more start each year, boredom and unemployment being the main contributors to this trend. Iran is a nightmare.   and Pakistan? even worse in my opinion, but that has more to do with the quality of life there which is abysmal. In terms of freedom, their law is mostly Sharia, their government is very corrupt and assassinations are a real threat, adultery is punishable by death and in the eyes of the law a women is only half a man (the testimony of 2 women is equal to that of 1 man), the ratio of men to women is the lowest in the world at 91:100 because so many die and are killed (an estimated 1000 women a year are murdered because they brought dishonor to their family); it is one of only 3 countries that has a lower life expectancy for women. There are also some serious problems that indirectly impede freedom when you have ultra high illiteracy as seen in Pakistan, where the average child gets 1.9 years of education and much of the government data on education is forged.   This is all paraphrase from The World Series Today: The Middle East and South Asia.   
-	-	Lasa: 6 million tibetan used to live here, now it is a ghost town....Not, they are still there.

-	-	I read that as "The **Last** free places on Earth in 2011", clicked the link, saw North Korea, got confused
0	2	I dislike these kind of assessments? What is 'freedom' in any case? Going by certain established critera disregards that certain people might have their own ideas of what constitutes freedom, or liberty.

-	-	Seems incredibly partial as a list. And while all of those do lack political freedoms, there are all sorts of other social, economic freedoms that many lack that could be argued make them more repressive than some of these on the list.
1	4	it's like a "who's who" of the next to revolt!

-	-	Yes?
-	-	&gt;which are widely available and tolerated by the govt.  Which is why they've been working to get as many offline as possible recently, amirite?
1	4	 &gt;I don't see how national media glorifying their own struggle against a foreign invader is any proof of censorship, or how it is funny  Have you ever been to China? I think you took my post the wrong way. I was not implying that their struggle against the Japanese is funny, that would be ridiculous. But saying there is no proof of censorship is just plain ignorant. They pick and choose what parts of their history they want to share with the public, way more so than in the United States. Sure, obviously American movies are often biased in favour of America, but if you go to china you'll realize that comparing this sort of thing to U 571 or Pearl Harbour is laughable. It's a whole different level of misinformation. 
1	4	China also have quite a bit of freedom. And an efficient central government, but some really shitty municipal level leadership. But that will change slowly. Therez talk of media reform and judiciary independence from top officials like wen jia bao. China is not that oppressive. I can't prove that really. Just take a vacation to anywhere in china. I guaranteed you will have a good time, even tibet.
1	7	ok i'm confused, are you arguing that censorship in the US and the UK is at the same level as China? There's no way you can believe that. And "Empire of the Sun" and "Shanghai" both touch on the Chinese role in WW2. 
0	2	There is nothing quite like reddit to call bullshit on bullshit....
-	-	So why is Somalia listed?
1	4	Having the largest prison population in the world is only one good reason for them to be on the list.
0	1	Fucking tell me about it. I usually stay up late at night wishing I could finally get my finances together to move to Somalia with my family. One day...one day.
-	-	Obviously it is bad there. If you take Freedom House's conclusions at face value, there are worse places. But as you can see with their ranking of the Palestinian territories that they also think they aren't free and were close into being apart of this list. I don't see how this is any way a defense for Israeli acts and policies. So, they aren't the most repressive force on earth doesn't sound all too flattering.
-	-	You are right... missed it. 
-	-	Yeah because no Cuban citizens have been imprisoned or executed for political dissent. Oh, you wouldn't get shot of course. You can enjoy being a visitor with money and privilege. 
-	-	It should be. You dictate to them what they can have and how much and how often and you will not let them travel in or out.  They are basically your slaves.
1	4	Yeah, you can use sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube only if you have a proxy or VPN. I was just there, and those three and many other sites are blocked. Everyone I spoke to who did have access to those sites used a VPN they paid for.   I enjoyed my time though, and people seem happy and pretty free for the most part, minus the part where they can't vote or protest anything. 
-	-	Cue comments about you being brainwashed, coerced, or a 50 cent party.
-	-	&gt; not a competition  &gt; a lot of strong competition  I get it, but this made me double take :D
-	-	... but there's no Zimbabwe on that list. State radio and tv... jamming signals from abroad... arresting journalists.... it's a crime to insult Robert Mugabe... murder rape and torture for political punishment... white farmers still being chased off the land... local currency cancelled.. Ruling party rallies begin with forced attendance and beating of anyone who won't, while Opposition rallies are usually banned, but if not, end with police beating opposition..
1	4	Just outta curiosity where in China do you live? From what I've understood from articles and some of my Chinese friends is that some places, like Hong Kong (I'm including HK and Macau as part of China), don't experience the same oppression as most parts of China. Perhaps you can comment on the accuracy of this statement?
-	-	I agree; listing China without listing Russia or even mentioning the U.S. is reaching.
-	-	Wonder what you would have said without a gun to your head... 
0	2	I just spent a month in China and facebook and youtube were banned in mainland China. Unless you're in Hong Kong, I have to call bullshit on this.   Edit: Also, there is a lot of censoring and straight up lies about of their history at museums and such. Television is also mostly (if not all) state-run and heavily censored. One thing I thought was particularly funny was there is a war history channel which plays, almost exclusively, Chinese movies about them beating the Japanese in WW2 without giving credit to the Allies.
-	-	This has some substance, but the most important question people should be asking is "freedom for whom?"
-	-	The UN is a joke.
-	-	The United States is one of the freest places on Earth if you're willing to leave urban civilization behind indefinitely.  Edit: As in, you should go live in the country instead of the city.
1	6	Why is the most free states are the ones i least wanna go to?
-	-	yeah, somehow i doubt they enjoy it much.
-	-	then why didn't Iran make the list? I'm totally bewildered by that. 
-	-	I totally did! But then I felt awful cause I doubt it was for fashion
-	-	Sure it fits well with a bullet hole on the forehead.... But honestly, it is quite badass. 
-	-	And I agree with just about everything you said. I don't know what the deal is here, unless folks are also confusing that subjectivity for objectivity.  I say Somalia isn't free because a large part of the "country" is dominated by conflict. You're not free if you can't go outside at night without being deliberately attacked or abducted, government or not.
-	-	&gt; The question I answered was "what countries are the most free in their opinion". It's a question of perception, not of objective reality.  Pretty sure that when hb_alien said "in their opinion" he meant Foreign Policy Magazine's opinion, not the countries' own perceptions of themselves.
1	4	Oh wow context fail on my part. I looked at your comment in isolation. 
-	-	I am sure adcn19 has a gun to his head.
-	-	[Here](http://mercatus.org/freedom-50-states-2011) is a list of freedom by state (USA) according to paternalism, regulations, and taxes.  Just thought it was relevant although our problems do not come close to the countries listed above.
-	-	Guys it's not a competition.  There was a lot of strong competition this year.  Just because your cause wasn't nominated doesn't mean you should feel slighted.
-	-	Really iraq and afghan is free to change their gov? How about a change from puppet state? 
-	-	But you outperform me as I see, guess a lot of people don't enjoy their American Freedom that much :)))
-	-	&gt; it's completely relevant. To a person raised in the jewish religion and culture an occupation is a moral and just thing. A blockade on millions of people is a moral and just thing. &gt; To rational atheists it's not.  Israel is mostly built of rational atheists secularists. The religious are a minority.  A blockade on millions of people is sometimes a necessary evil (as imposed on North Korea, for example).  &gt; Ordering from who? Israel? Because they probably have given up on israel to deliver what they want and need.  Then why do they order 6000 daily tons?  It's not from Israel. Israel just delivers, filtering weapons. 
-	-	You really think Freedom House would change their list to bend to US foreign policy?  Nice conspiracy you have there.  There is a reason why those countries you named weren't on the list and it has nothing to do with the US influencing the list.  Mainly it is due to the freedom of the people being able to change their government.
-	-	Iraq and Afghanistan have the opposite problem:  Anarchy.
1	4	You must really like your downvotes.
1	4	&gt;You do realize Hamas controls Gaza, executes all of the gays that it would like, and Israel exerts no control over any of it?  I am sure many of the thousands of people israel has killed were also gay.  Just as I am sure you realize israel is running a blockade on gaza.  &gt;You are ridiculous. As I already explained -- they do get what they like.  We all know that's not true. They don't get what they like. They get what you allow them to get.  That's what a blockade is all about.  &gt;They are not filling the shipments that they're already getting.  It's not your place to restrict anything to anybody.  &gt;Funny that you try to make it about religion or culture, which are completely irrelevant.  it's completely relevant. To a person raised in the jewish religion and culture an occupation is a moral and just thing.  A blockade on millions of people is a moral and just thing.  To rational atheists it's not.  &gt;Then why are Gaza's authorities not ordering enough to fill up the shipments?  Ordering from who? Israel? Because they probably have given up on israel to deliver what they want and need. They are probably looking at other means of getting what they need.  &gt;Given that Hamas uses all of its power to commit war crimes and attack Israeli cities with rockets -- it makes sense for Israel to attempt to restrict the rocket attacks with a siege.  Given that the IDF routinely launches attacks on gaza killing and injuring many people it makes perfect sense that Hamas should attack Israel any way they can.  &gt;What doesn't make sense -- is that even as the siege was pretty much removed, intellectually dishonest (the main bulk of anti-Israelis) continue to complain.  If it was "pretty much removed" you would not be blocking these ships.  &gt;Israel is doing some really bad things, which you barely hear about (mainly West Bank settlement related), but all you hear about are false allegations about bad things that Israel doesn't do  Israel does many bad things thanks to the support of the vast majority of israelis and the vast majority of the jewish diaspora including you.  As long as jews world wide act as apologists and deniers israel will continue to do bad things.  So pay yourself on the back and congratulate yourself for helping israel do many bad things.
0	5	&gt; We've been blowing up a huge chunk of the middle east for almost a decade now. How are you not ashamed of what our government is doing in our name?  It's even more sad than that, we're a complete war country. If you look through our history, we have always had a ridiculous number of major wars going on. As George Carlin put it  &gt;This country has only been around for 200 years, and we've already had 10 major wars. We average a major war every 20 years in this country.  What's going on now is hardly new.
-	-	You live in a democratic republic.
-	-	&gt;As a reader of /r/worldnews, one would think Gaza or the West Bank would make that list?  It should be there but no mainstream media would dare imply israel does anything wrong anywhere.
1	6	Why yes, 66% of their funds come directly from the US government.
-	-	Actually, you're wrong on two counts. First, just because a group may say something doesn't simply make it so. Do you know there metrics? Obviously you don't because if you bothered to read the actual report you'll see how you're wrong.    So, Freedom House is using a rating system based on political rights (PR) and civil liberties (CL), as well as marking an entity as "Free", "Partly Free", and "Not Free". You will see that all the entities listed on the website are mostly either a PR of 6/7 and a CL of 6/7. And if you see in the document that Gaza Strip is a PR:6 and CL:6 with a freedom status of "Not Free" and the West Bank as a PR:6 and CL:5 and a freedom status of "Not Free". The document is linked in the site.    So you see, you're wrong on two counts.
-	-	If Gaza or the West Bank were in this list then I could almost guarantee there would be a massive influx of Zionists downvoting and parading Israel for it's humanitarianism. 
-	-	no iraq either?  I would prefer in China or Cuba over Iraq or Afghanistan
-	-	The list was compiled by Freedom House.  An independent and non biased organization.  Just so you know.
1	4	I loves me a good logical fallacy!
-	-	Are you saying that Freedom House is not free???
-	-	TIL America isn't so bad off comparatively. 
1	4	Funny how many countries "close" to the US are in this list. And Cuba is on there - while Bahrain, Iran and Saudi Arabia are not. Hillary-ious. Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, South Sudan and Kazakhstan are also soooo extremly free...

0	1	As a Canadian, I'm regularly disgusted by my fellow Canadians that go to resorts in Cuba for vacation. Way to support a horrible dictatorship with a long history of human rights issues.   Even everybody's darling, David Suzuki, praised Cuba. What the fuck.

0	2	Bullshit!!!!
-	-	Where is America on that list?
-	-	I read the title as "The Last Free Places on Earth in 2011", was confused, then as I read the article I was even more confused.
1	4	It's a good question, indeed. Perhaps they don't perceive their election as fraudulent as others. 
-	-	I do have a vpn that I use but I do not pay for it, there are many free ones you can download outside of the mainland for free. Sure you cannot protest here but in my experiences, chinese people are generally much calmer and level headed so it would take a lot for them to protest. On the matter of voting, there are actually elections in China to vote local officials, most of whom are party members but independent candidates can also run and they feed into the hierarchy of the government, at the moment there are rumors of unprecedented numbers of ind.candidates running at the next one, so watch this space!
-	-	It depends on who is holding it haha
-	-	And Israel isn't even on the list, and they run the prison of Gaza. Nor do they mention the people of other nations the US has imprisoned in Gitmo and Egypt and other places.  The interwebs has failed miserably.  &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;   
-	-	I'm in Shanghai, on the mainland. I use a VPN server which are widely available and tolerated by the govt.  History is portrayed in relation to the culture of the people, I've never seen a WW2 film from a western country that even mentions the Chinese role/losses never mind what they did to help win the war. Also the state does control the media and censorship, I believe theres also an agency in the USA which censors media (FCC, FAA, I'm not sure) And if you go to the UK, my homeland, the History Channel there plays almost non stop documentaries of how we won ww2, so stop picking up on small shit, it's the same in other places too
1	4	I have seen inaccurate movies about US exploits in WWII. Check out U 571 and Pearl Harbour. On the otherhand, I have seen Chinese WWII movies where the protagonist is a downed Flying Tigers pilot.   The Chinese were fighting the Japanese since 37, half a decade before any official American involvement. I don't see how national media glorifying their own struggle against a foreign invader is any proof of censorship, or how it is funny. American media equally plays down WWII involvement of the Chinese and the Soviets, the two countries with the most losses during the war, even though China was responsible for tying down most of Japan's troops and the Soviets were responsible for taking Berlin.
-	-	Living in many countries doesn't qualify your opinion very much. How about statistical proof?
-	-	Yeah, and when you start hearing about 'free market' take it with about a pound of salt.
-	-	Australia and Canada have more limited speech than the USA but I'd say Iceland leads. 
-	-	The question I answered was "what countries are the most free *in their opinion*". It's a question of perception, not of objective reality.   The US has heavy self-reinforcement of how great it is, and "freedom" is one of the pillars of the US's self-perception of greatness. Many of its simple folk are not well-traveled (both literally and in book-learning), and lack the ability to make a solid assessment of the US's level of freedom relative to the rest of the world.  The US's isolated geography and paltry vacation time &amp; benefits are a large part of this also. As a result, many Americans sincerely believe with total certainty that they live in the most free nation on earth.   North Korea has intense levels of propaganda and isolation, a recipe for people lacking the perspective to know better and believing what they've been told all their lives. So there's a case to be made there.  Somalia is free in the most literal primitive sense. Whether Somalis perceive this as being free or under the oppression of chaos, I don't know what the common Somali answer is to that. But I think there's a case to be made there. 
-	-	You sir, are slllloooooow.
-	-	Have an upvote from an American.  Our government shames us constantly and makes us all look bad.  
-	-	You forget to tell him to shut up.
1	6	Why is my country , Vietnam not on there? I say something bad about the government openly and the first thing people do is tell me to shut up and that am risking a lot. 
-	-	Tibet is not a country, they want it to be, but it is not.
-	-	Saudi Arabia is pretty damn repressive.  It's got more restrictions on women than most (all?) other Middle Eastern countries, and dissent is not tolerated.  The royal family uses its immense wealth to hold power instead of violence, but a higher state-supported standard of living does not make the people any more free.  
-	-	Israel only controls 3 of Gaza's 4 borders. The Egypt-Gaza border is under full control of Egypt and the Hamas-run Palestinian Authority in Gaza. Given that Israel does not control all of Gaza's borders, it cannot by definition be running a "prison" in Gaza.
-	-	I can. It isn't that hard.
-	-	You think an organisation with a clear political agenda funded by the US government which downright refuses to listen to any international condemnation of Israel is somehow going to paint them in a negative way? Hah.
-	-	Really? You haven't figured it out? You have the ability to post your opinion on the internet.
-	-	Nah.  The people of Gaza and West Bank are more free than those in Syria.  Syria is not on the list either
1	4	It looks like they were mostly going on internal repression, what a government does to its own people. Gaza and the West Bank are repressed externally more than internally. 
1	6	Why would they mention the US?  We have quite a bit of freedom.  We have some shitty leadership right now, but that changes every couple of years.  To mention the US when there are many other nations which are repressive and oppressive would do this list a disservice.
-	-	I'm in Shanghai, and I imagine the people in HK and Macau have a very different way of life. I think their rights, liberties are far more westernised as they are still in transition from western rule. I also think that in some of the autonomous regions life is more controlled than in others, due to insecurity caused by rebellious ethnic minorities there. (I cannot and won't comment on any specific group of people or region, as I do not know the situation fully) And it is true travel is restricted to some areas, but I think oppression is too strong a word to use (North Koreans are oppressed!)
-	-	I do everything objectively.
0	1	I have to admit that It's infuriating how little people understand about how fucking shitty the Cuban government has been to us over the last 60 years.  Yeah, it's not as backwards Afghanistan but it's totalitarian. 
0	1	&gt;A siege makes them Israeli slaves?  That's the purpose of it yes.  &gt;Gaza gets about 6000 tons in ~220 truckloads of daily shipments.  They should get as much as they want, need and can afford not what YOU think they should get.  The fact that you think you should be able dictate what they should get, when they should get it and how much they should get is a prime indicator of how immoral and disgusting your religion and culture are.  &gt;Israel isn't even the bottleneck on the entry of goods to Gaza.  Yes it is.   &gt;Gaza's residents can actually travel in and out through Egypt.  This is a recent development and one that made israel very angry. Let's see how long israel lets this continue.    
-	-	&gt; Guys it's not a competition. There was a lot of strong competition this year.  ???  
-	-	oh boy here we go again
-	-	Where are you from, so that we can determine your biases? Also provide us with your view of US foreign policy since this will affect your opinion as well.
-	-	As a matter of fact I'm not saying it exists to the same level in the UK, I cant comment on the USA as I've never spent a long time there, however I am aware that the press there is not as free as other countries, particularly in Northern Europe. And in the UK there is currently a big debate about the legality of censorship, and the legality of some methods. But I'm aware there several things that are censored, Local authorities also have the right to get certain things censored, for example earlier this year there were a few murders in my home city, which appeared on a news website, and were gone the next day. So I'm saying that censorship does exist everywhere, but who really knows to which extent it exists anywhere? You can't be sure of exactly what's going on all the time, and the truth is there is very little that happens in China that would be censored and a lot of the 'human rights abuses' which happen and are unreported are to help the government save face, which is very important in Chinese culture, so you really have to look at the big picture and not focus on one thing such as censorship.
-	-	America always forgets the dark times in its History to portray, ie slavery, Macarthyism, etc
-	-	You could perhaps list some examples.
-	-	I'd say positions on this list should probably be reserved for countries with real oppression problems.  The US is actually fairly free, even if we do have one of the largest prison populations in the world.  I'd also say our prisoners are treated better than *most* other nations prisoners are.
-	-	As a reader of /r/worldnews, one would think Gaza or the West Bank would make that list?  Also, if Gaza or the West Bank were high on that list, you can rest assured this post would have a lot more votes and comments.
1	4	One should bear in mind the political baggage that comes from "Freedom House" which gets 80% of its funding from the US government. That is not to say that these countries are 'free' in any sense, but a list like this will certainly lend itself to biases based on which countries are omitted and which ones aren't.   Just as a small example they list South Ossetia as being 'unfree' but give no reasons - I certainly wonder what it would be like if the Georgian military took control after shelling the population with rockets. I'm sure they would have turned it into a bastion of freedom and democracy... 
1	4	somalia is on here, and china but not singapore? kewl, guess we got us a good ol fashioned "people we don't like" list
1	4	How is China and even tibet on the list? I prefer them over countries like Afghanistan, Iran or Iraq.
-	-	*this list has been brought to you by the US government*  *btw, Afghanistan is free. just so you know.*   -- *Hillary*
-	-	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_House  "Freedom House receives about 80% of its budget from the U.S. government..."
-	-	Yeap, because America is the land of the free. Just as long as you arent Black, Brown, Asian, Jewish, Irish, Middle Eastern or Italian.
0	2	This is a bullshit list Libya at number 2 give me a break. you wont see pakistan, afghanistan, iraq or the Palestinian states, because that would go against american foreign policy. ever wonder why we are in Libya and have not interfered in any other revolution. Oil and less know monetary policy Gaddafi was going to introduce currency tied to a gold standard.
-	-	This list is nonsense, and mixes murderous dictatorships with countries that simply have a different political philospohy to the USA.
-	-	I don't think you can put a number on freedom, the entire concept of this list is poor. You can name countries where rights are violated and people are oppressed, but putting one above another isn't something that can be accurately done.
-	-	No, these are country's which *actually* have *legitimate* oppression.
-	-	People Jerky?
1	4	I've heard that education there only costs like a dollar a day, for less than a cup of coffee your children can be educated and clothed! Now that's a free and happy place to live I bet!
1	4	I came here expecting to see angsty reddit children making polemic cases for how the US should be on the list amongst the likes of North Korea and Somalia. I was not disappointed. 
-	-	Tibets on there. 
-	-	Western Sahara is not a country either.It seems they just went by unfree regions/countries.
0	1	then what about Yemen, Bahrain, Oman, etc   and you're telling me that Saudi Arabia is less repressive than some of those countries in the list above it? fuck you. 
-	-	Western Sahara + Tibet. The people in West Sahara, even if they can't hold elections, have it politically and freedom-wise much better than Gazans.
-	-	According to the anti-Israelis here, Gaza should be off the scale, as a new incarnation of the Warsaw Ghetto.
-	-	Yes it is. Fifth or sixth down
1	4	Free != good to live in.  An anarchy is perfectly free, but not very safe.
-	-	Exactly. At least you won't get shot there for looking at a soldier the wrong way
1	4	Not saying that the Iraqi and Afghan governments are not repressing people to a certain extent (I am admittedly uninformed on that particular topic), but I think when some people compare China and Cuba with Iraq and Afghanistan they're confusing security with freedom. The government can repress the shit out of you without you being at high risk of bombings, kidnapping and the like..   Too many people fail to make this distinction. Free countries must always sacrifice some security for that freedom.   I like to say that I prefer freedom over security, and to the extent that those scales lean in freedom's direction where I live, I do. But I bet there are people in fairly free (but highly insecure) countries who would give their left nut to spend some time in Cuba or China.   EDIT: I should type faster. This thread saw a lot of posts while I was typing mine, and it seems I'm not the only one who sees this distinction. Not that I thought I was the only one, but I wanted to say it first, dammit.
1	4	I would actually prefer china over a lot of countries. Seriously, major cities in china are really among world class developed nations'. You actually get more freedom if you are a foreigner. Even more freedom if you are a influential one. Most corp have their own vpn. Besides its not like secret police is gonna knock on your door the moment u post something politically unapproved by the gov. Therez 2 billion? netizen and couple thousand internet police and the auto censor is only good at deleting stuff. They really don't have the time to come physically delete you. You really have a greater chance of getting assassinated by the cia.
-	-	No, we live in a republic.
-	-	Yeah yeah, I work very hard to get better people into office.  But I have a question for you, how is it that you are not ashamed of what our country is doing?  We are bombing six countries right now.  We've been blowing up a huge chunk of the middle east for almost a decade now.  How are you not ashamed of what our government is doing in our name?  
-	-	I know it's shitty. But that doesn't change the fact that Afghanistan is shittier, and quite frankly belongs on this list a lot more than Cuba does.
1	4	I bet you are an american and never been there. Just take the route from canada here and visit there. Its not that bad for a tourism destination and you get to walk around anywhere you like. Man their cigars are dirt cheap and better than any stuff you find state side. They have to stage the whole country to fake this. Its really different from that fake tour to nk. The resort and hotels are owned by the gov tho. But i wouldn't take a vacation to afghan.
-	-	I have no illusions about censorship.  I mean where American exploits in WWII are erroneously downplayed in Chinese movies.
-	-	Is that so?
-	-	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China#Film  Some examples of censorship. A google search of propaganda films in China will give you more information if you're still skeptical. 
-	-	Yes.  You are clearly a small minded idiot that has never actually experienced real oppression by a government.
-	-	We live in a democracy, with some disenfranchisement, but democracy nonetheless. If you have a problem with the elected officials, you can run yourself. With your character I'm sure you'll get plenty of votes.
0	1	&gt; That's the purpose of it yes.  You do realize Hamas controls Gaza, executes all of the gays that it would like, and Israel exerts no control over any of it?  &gt; They should get as much as they want, need and can afford not what YOU think they should get. &gt; The fact that you think you should be able dictate what they should get, when they should get it and how much they should get is a prime indicator of how immoral and disgusting your religion and culture are.  You are ridiculous. As I already explained -- they **do** get what they like. They are not filling the shipments that they're already getting.  Funny that you try to make it about religion or culture, which are completely irrelevant.  &gt; Yes it is.  Then why are Gaza's authorities not ordering enough to fill up the shipments?  &gt; This is a recent development and one that made israel very angry. Let's see how long israel lets this continue.  Given that Hamas uses all of its power to commit war crimes and attack Israeli cities with rockets -- it makes sense for Israel to attempt to restrict the rocket attacks with a siege.  What doesn't make sense -- is that even as the siege was pretty much removed, intellectually dishonest (the main bulk of anti-Israelis) continue to complain.  Israel is doing some really bad things, which you barely hear about (mainly West Bank settlement related), but all you hear about are false allegations about bad things that Israel doesn't do.  An [Israeli Arab](http://www.reddit.com/user/thedevilsdictionary) summed it up well:  &gt; How about, go after the myriad of problems they openly exhibit, and stop making bullshit up? Just a thought. It's not just reddit here, it's the Pro-Palestinian people in general so eager to jump on any scrap of dirt, when there's a mountain of it 4 feet away.
-	-	Is that so?
-	-	Wtf russia is not on the list? Eh...Putin? Cartels?
-	-	Notice the west bank and gaza are not there even though their freedom is severly restricted by israel.
1	4	Ha . . . lol.  I thought the article was titled "The LAST Fred Places on Earth in 2011".  I was TOTALLY confused.  I was like "whoosh!"  It's the L**EA**ST free places on Earth.  Okay.  I get it now.  Derr
-	-	Are you living in Vietnam right now? If so, I think you answered your own question.
1	6	"freedom house ranking"  yeah americans are not on the list? thats because the report is american dumbassese  and i never saw libya in reports like these before. obvious war propaganda.  im surprised they even dared to mention saudi and china
-	-	http://imgur.com/0qHJn That's Badass
1	4	"North Koreans enjoy the lowest levels of freedom in the world according to Freedom House's rankings."  That is not really funny
-	-	TIL: Cuba has mint-condition WWII-era [T-34-85](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-34) tanks.
0	1	Interestingly I don't see Fiji in the list, nor do I see few other middle eastern nations, along with Pakistan. In Pakistan, even internet doesn't have freedom. I don't see Israel and Palestine and Iraq and Afghanistan. This list is bull. I suppose adding Iraq and Afghanistan and Israel makes America look bad, huh?  Amongst the most free nations, I would like to vote India. Man, those Indians they can do whatever the fuck they want over there, and there is peace.
1	4	It is odd that your country is not up their, but compared to your neighbors (China, Laos) the state repression of free speech is not as great, or just hasn't been coordinated enough to reach the ears of foreign journalists. For example, while China has gone a great length into censuring western media like CNN, BBC, and youtube, your government doesn't really care. This, and other gestures from the Vietnamese government, should go a long way in making sure that Vietnam is a sure choice for foreign investment as China tries to reign in and keep its tight control.
-	-	I wonder what the most free countries are in their opinion.
-	-	Did anyone else think [this](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_images/110630_de%20Cote%20d%27Ivoire_114482579.jpg) was a bad ass bracelet? 
-	-	Clearly situation in China is as bad as it is in Chad or the Ivory Coast, lol.
-	-	USA has the most liberal free speech rights, maybe America? Hard to tell though, government wise were pretty free, but gays could use a few more rights.
1	4	You're wrong just like the parent. If you took the time to read the actual document, you can see that the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are both "Not Free".
-	-	Nobody has to try to make America look bad.  They do that on their own.
1	4	Wow, you're dreaming big. I'd settle for Syria.
-	-	I think it's just a list of 20 examples, not all states that are not free.   [The map on the front cover](http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/special_report/101.pdf) is supposed to demonstrate which are free and which are not.
-	-	Yeap , and how did I answered my own question? I'm not exactly vocal about my opinion . If I were  , I would be sitting in a torture chamber right now. 
-	-	I kind of doubt that freedom of media plays a large role in foreign investment.  Also, I just want to make a small spelling correction:  "Censure" means to make an official reprimand. I think you meant to say "censor".
-	-	But it was for fashion.  The plus side however, is after the intimidation aspect, there remains the utilitarian functionality of the bracer.  Were it purely for fashion/indimidation, the bullets would have ultimately been duds, and rivetted in.  In their current state, they are intimidating, however, if they need to defend themselves from other governments making claim, while in their foxhole, they have a couple extra rounds to attempt to swing the argument to their advantage.
-	-	Bam! Internet access inherent contradiction burn 
1	4	People from all the country on the list can post on reddit if they have an interenet connection. It is not like this is Hukcheamingsucksdicks.com
-	-	I don't have to.  The article already goes over it for me. 
-	-	Actually, it's a human rights issue as well. Just because there might be worse places doesn't somehow invalidate the crimes committed against them. Also, according to the same source, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are "Not Free".
-	-	Tibet is in there....
-	-	I bet usa is at the top. Iraq or Afghanistan probably a close second given their newly found liberty.
-	-	Was wondering this myself. 
-	-	[Wikipedia](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/List_of_freedom_indices) has the Freedom House list, compared with other freedom indices.   The short answer is 'it's complicated'.
-	-	Zimbabwe is pretty damn oppressive, but at least their opposition leader managed to strike a power-sharing deal.
1	4	The coalition government is a good deal better than people think. Still pretty shitty as a place to live, and terrifying, and dangerous, but as far as freedom goes, it rightly ranks above the countries on this list. Tsvangiri's been a moderating influence on the government's own corruption, the rampant criminal activity (even the activity influenced by Zanu PF's policies) doesn't restrict freedom so much as terrify the hell out of everyone in the country. I mean, really, they held free elections, and the dictator for life was voted out. He didn't step down anyway, but people were free enough to vote against him, and he did form a coalition government.
-	-	Inaccurate; California is missing.
-	-	They forgot Wisconsin.
-	-	ITS AMERIKKKKKAAA
-	-	West bank is relatively liberated. Gaza, they say, isn't. Maybe it didn't make the list because it's not a country yet?
-	-	I'd say a tossup between USA! and North Korea. Perhaps Somalia too, seems they have a real 'anything goes' atmosphere going on. 
-	-	I guess your tiny brain can't comprehend varying levels of things.  They're talking about "the least free countries".  There are *much worse* places to be than the US.
-	-	Insanity Wolf plans his summer vacation. 
-	-	It did occur to me after I had written it, but I'm not going to Barry Bonds it and take an asterisk.
1	6	Compromises of freedoms in first world countries are small potatoes compared to what's going on in a majority of the world. Even in the higher end of the developing world, we'd be surprised at some of the shit that goes on, oppression that's facilitated both by corruption and the government. I remember talking to recent migrants I used to work about what goes on in their countries and I was stunned. It made my bitching about the government seem like a spoiled child having a tantrum. I can see why they would do anything to get to the first world.  However, this doesn't mean that we should simply accept what we have and stop whining. I still want equal rights for everyone no matter their gender, race, financial situation or sexuality. I still want people to be able to express themselves artistically or politically without censorship. If anything, seeing the situation in these countries reminds me that in the first world, there is more of a chance than anywhere of creating a truly 'free' society.   It also reminds me that many of these regimes are directly or indirectly created by the first world. In the first world, we have more of an influence over our government than anywhere else and we should use that influence to try to steer our governments away from foreign policy that breeds these regimes.
-	-	No Iran?

-	-	Two stones killed with one bird.
-	-	yup, totalitarian communism might as well not be communism as marx / trotsky saw it. It is all the working together, without any of the mutual benefit. It is what seems to be the error that happens in all communism, once you have your revolution, you cannot just allow people to vote and allow capitalism back 4 years later, thus you eliminate all other parties, and it only gets more authoritarian from there on.
-	-	The protectionism is an added benefit, I'll give you that. But the reason they banned it wasn't for trade reasons. It was to control information and because of that whole google finally saying no to censorship controversy about a year ago.
-	-	I would say those two things are basically one and the same the protectionism is to protect against foreign influence, however China has also said they don't want western companies getting a foothold in the market until the Chinese companies have had time to grow stronger which I think is also part of the issue.
1	4	Duh. China is babysitting its own Facebook dittoes, like RenRen, until they grow large enough that their network effect can reasonably compete with that of Facebook.  BTW, if you don't know what a network effect is, stop wining about what the Chinese gov't is doing and start reading Wikipedia.
-	-	Does that mean I can get an invite now since the Chinese just forfeited their memberships?
1	6	The Chinese will do this with every "social network" site unless it "approves" them. What that entitles is giving the Chinese government access 24/7, with the ability to take down the site/content as they see fit. Of course no one would allow that, except the Chinese government/Chinese based social networks. Wasn't a big surprised. 
-	-	Eventually, this is going to end badly.
-	-	I'm in China on holiday at the moment, and have had no problems getting onto Google+... I'm on it now in fact. Weird. I had completely expected them to block it at some stage though, not surprising at all.
-	-	And yet Google is the most cherished company here on reddit...
-	-	Its called protectionism.  China has been doing it for years.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism  It is pretty much the exact opposite of what America has been doing.
-	-	The apologists in this thread are so cute. 
-	-	This is the problem with too much government. A government that gives you everything controls everything.
1	6	The government bans any form of (usually foreign) social media they have no direct control over (and IMDb, for some reason). Google and gmail are periodically spotty, so this doesn't come as much of a surprise. They get away with doing it without too much protest because there's usually a Chinese copy available.
1	4	The good news is this is *FANTASTIC* for Google+. This gets their name out there, lets people believe it'll have power.
-	-	Was wondering how long it would last, hours was actually my guess.  Wouldn't want it to compete with renren for the hearts and minds of the Chinese students. I'm pretty sure google would take a great deal of renren's users away. Usually in my discussions about google and the issue of what they are doing wrong in China about 1/2 to 3/4 of my students side with google. 
-	-	Its called censorship.  China has been doing it for years.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship
-	-	No company is obligated to do business in any specific country, and said companies able to work with any country in blocking access of their product under any circumstances they deem agreeable.
-	-	It's both censorship and protectionism at the same time. Two birds,,
0	1	Protectionism? The fuck are you smoking? This is straight denying freedom of speech and a personal vendetta against Google.
-	-	the Chinese dictatorship is communist in name only, they don't give people shit   
1	6	IMDB was banned originally for a movie it listed about the Tibean issue. Then it was reallowed and about a month later banned again, not sure why the second one but, surprise surprise, China has thier own version now so don't worry....
1	4	It's also protectionism, so was facebook and youtube and twitter. Chinese government does not like competitors in it's media sector. 
1	4	I think this'll have a rebellious efect on it, like *"oh this google+ was banned in china, I'm gonna try it out!"* sort of thing.

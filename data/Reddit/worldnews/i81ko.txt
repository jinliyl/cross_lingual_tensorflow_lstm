0	2	Greece's problems are much more than that but I was pointing out that the recent attention to to these problems was a result of the economic downturn, which hurts their main industries much more than it would hurt other nations of comparable size.  Greece joined the EU something like 30 years ago which itself is significant since, if the country has consistently been running deficits, that implies some measure of certainty over its economic future if it had been able to avoid scrutiny for so long, which is something they no longer have with the economic recession.  And no one is calling Germany nazis over this right now.  The package given to Greece is given solely because no one else is liable to buy their debt since the chances of Greece defaulting is a very real possibility.  Greece has many structural problems and the public sector is bloated with assurances and liabilities that are simply beyond its ability to pay off.  I personally don't see any reason what entitlement the Greeks have in protesting, since the primary function of a democracy is to represent the will of the voters and they've quite frankly had 30 years since military dictatorship to get that into order, and I do understand the measure of anger in the European population from Germany and other essentially creditor nations which will be primarily responsible for paying their lifestyle.
1	6	Greece's government no longer has the ability to borrow money on the market because there is no investor confidence in the country's ability to pay it back.  Therefore, it either risks extremely high interest rates on the market (since it's essentially become a junk bond), or it takes up the EU offer to restructure the debt using money from Germany and the IMF.    The thing about Greece is that the global recession hurt them more so than most other nations.  Greece's primary industries are tourism and shipping.  With tourism, it's plainly obvious that no one's going to spend thousands to travel there anymore when there isn't even the ability to pay the bills back home.  With shipping, it's also clear that the volume of trade has fallen since the recession hit, and that this is only slowly going to come back.    Once the recession is over, and with certain measures that are essentially going to be imposed on Greece for austerity and internal auditing, it stands to reason that Greece has the ability to turn small budget surpluses that can slowly begin to pay back the amount it owes.  Obviously this isn't surefire by any measure, but, if there's any logic to not expelling Greece from the EU, it's this.

-	-	That's my point too. I accept the fact that the Greeks made a collective mistake by supporting corrupted governments which ran the country with massive loans and an even more massive public sector. But, with the current austerity measures, the economy will never recover. That means the country will possibly go bankrupt, and, then, the other EU countries lose their money. IF the country survives, the loans will be paid back with great interest.
0	2	&gt; The extra wages are just the benefits that we don't take each month (like in your country for example), but we only take them altogether twice a year  Can you please explain what you mean?  What benefits that you don't take each month?
1	6	&gt;How is this supposed to help?  Absolutely no idea:   - the Greeks are saddled with even more debt to pay back  &gt;In July and August, the Greek government has to redeem bonds to the tune of €9.4bn. Without €12bn from the eurozone and the IMF – the fifth tranche of last year's 110 billion bailout   How on Earth is Greece supposed to pay back those 230 billion Euro bailouts?    They already couldn't service their original debt last year ...  - at the same time, their economy is driven into recession with  stringent austerity measures   &gt;A statement said that the draconian package of €28bn in spending cuts and tax rises plus a €50bn privatisation programme   EU politics are well known for being stunningly irrational, but this really defies logic.  
-	-	You know how spitting in the fire prevents it from spreading? This.   But seriously, European bureaucrats don't want to kick the Greeks out of the Eurozone because it'll make the euro look weak. Instead, they're dumping cash into the Greek economy, thus buying themselves time to do... nothing else, really. The Greeks themselves are horrified by the idea of not being able to retire after puberty, so they happily accept the money while still hanging around Syntagma square instead of getting back to work. 
1	4	While this decision definitely needs to be viewed in a critical light, can we refrain from making comments like these. They're sectarian and really don't add to the discussion at all.
1	7	Big hint: you all are the only ones that call your country that.  
-	-	Here, you dropped your "g".
-	-	Then get your money out of the banks if you don't want the banks to get rich.
1	4	If Greece can hold out until the world economy returns to a boom state then they can start earning money through tourism again.
-	-	Greece doesn't know whose pet it is anymore. 
-	-	I will try to give you a real answer despite of the fact that you are prejudiced against Greeks.   &gt;Oh, I'm sure that having an average salary of ~1000 euros,  Well, we are talking about a very expensive country here. I don't think 1000 euros average wage (which seems  high to me btw) can be considered an exaggeration.    &gt;receiving 14-15 monthly wages  The extra wages are just the benefits that we don't take each month (like in your country for example), but we only take them altogether twice a year.    &gt;retiring at the age of 53 with 80% of your wage paid in pension  This is completely bullshit. Maybe there is a very special case like fighter pilots that can do that, but most of the people I know retire at around 65.    &gt;why exactly are your countrymen protesting?  Because the austerity measures are exhausting, there are no jobs, and they voted for a pm that was promising that he will never ask IMF for a loan.    &gt;How will your country repay the 125% of GDP debt without cutting spending?  It can be done with measures that will stimulate the economy and create jobs. Certainly not with these austerity measures. Cutting spending is one thing, but completely draining the average tax-payer and sending all the young scientists to work int he rest of Europe because of the lack of jobs, is not going to solve anything. 
-	-	&gt; There's nothing to add to the discussion   Nothing - you - can add.
1	4	O.k., thanks for clarification, so I guess we are pretty much on the same page.   But I do disagree on your assessment of their economy. The main industries (if you want to call it that) of Greece are tourism and shipping (They also produce most of Italys "original" toscana olive oil, but that is another matter). Both industries took a small hit, but not in any way comparable what other countries had to suffer through. Most of Greeks big ships are ferries and tankers, and while these were affected, there is still demand for their service, even in times of crisis (as opposed to container ships).   The truth is, Greece produces next to nothing that is of any interest to the outside world. And I really don't understand your argument about Greece joining the EU 30 years ago. Yes they did, yes they ran deficits for all this time. But until the creation of the Eurozone the national economies were a national matter and nothing other countries or the EU were concerned with. The Greeks were known to cook their books, but mainly just to get EU subsidies. Nobody, including the Greek government really knew the full extent of their obligations.   I also disagree on "no one is calling Germany nazis over this ". There are actually quite a few. General opinion over Germany has never been good in Greece (fortunately most Germans don't speak Greek, otherwise public opinion would change quite a lot), but there are many signs at the protests that call Merkel a nazi. There is also this common sign of the European stars as a swastika, which I find particularly offensive. 
1	4	&gt;If you have "absolutely no idea" how the bailouts are supposed *to work*, how can you say whether it is logical or not?  Nice try.  &gt;&gt;How is this supposed *to help?*  &gt;Absolutely no idea:  But a bit too obvious.   - [Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve chairman, said a default by Greece is ''almost certain''](http://www.smh.com.au/action/printArticle?id=2434821 )   - [European politicians faced unpleasant choices and had to respond.

-	-	Oh, I'm sure that having an average salary of more than 1000 euros, receiving 14-15 monthly wages and retiring at the age of 53 with 80% of your wage paid in pension is horrible. You must all be devastated.  And since you're Greek, can you tell me why exactly are your countrymen protesting? How will your country repay the 125% of GDP debt without cutting spending?
0	5	Sorry, UnitedKingdish_Gentleman.
-	-	You and your detailed economic analysis.
0	1	Oh fuck.
-	-	No need to make this political.
1	4	England's decision not to adopt the Euro sure is saving them a lot of money.
1	4	As an EU citizen, I am glad to help out. But I'm afraid the money will once again be pocketed by the corrupt people in power.
0	2	It's all Monopoly money anyway.  
1	4	Here we go again, round two, €120bn down the drain, the average European taxpayer is thankful...
0	1	And people wonder why the rich get richer...  Why are the middle class German tax payers repaying rich German bankers that lent money to other rich people in Greece that will never pay it back?  On top of all this, there are a lot of Germans who think this is a great idea.  What. The. Fuck.
-	-	This is not money for Greece. It is money for the (German and French) banks.  &gt;In July and August, the Greek government has to redeem bonds to the tune of €9.4bn.  which means this money goes right to the people who bought Greek debt 10 years ago.  I would gladly give money to Greece, for infrastructure programs, to build Solar panels for a Clean Energy future, a Marshal Plan for Greece. But that is not what is happening.
1	6	Can someone seriously explain to me the reasoning that lead to this decision? How is this supposed to help?
1	8	The slow and painful end to the Greek state.
1	6	So, they payed off goldmann sachs... what now?
-	-	&gt;subject to parliamentary passage of an austerity package next week.  That's leaving a pretty epic "if" in all these machinations. 
-	-	reino unido... royaume-uni?
1	6	Got any pics of your yacht?  I'm thinking of taking up sailing.  
1	4	Greek retirees with 2 yachts each would like to thank the average European employee. 
-	-	&gt;EU leaders accepted David Cameron's argument that the cost should be borne by those using the single currency  Hm.. this is one of the rare times that I would say good job David Cameron. The UK made a great move by not adopting the Euro, it seems.   And Germany keeps getting screwed. First East Germany, now Eurozone.
-	-	The redundant title is redundant
1	4	You know they have 30 working days off each year for holidays, and like 4h midnoon breaks, and yet they produce almost nothing except tourism. Douchebag country, leeching on EU money. Thank you Greece!
-	-	The Eurozone should end **RIGHT NOW**.
-	-	The United Kingdom's!
1	6	What a load of crap. Greece still runs a huge deficit. This money isn't just for the banks, it is also for current expenses. And there ARE several infrastructure programs running right now, again financed mainly by the French and German taxpayers. So yes, it is very much happening and has been for decades.
-	-	Look at all the pink and purple.
-	-	What many people don't understand is that the money does not, and has not from the previous loans gone to the Greek people. This made huge news only on one news channel in Greece. The loan money goes to the Greek banks that were in debt. These crooked banks shifted that debt to the people. The money that is paying government workers is still circulating throughout the government, until that is when the Greek Parliament is unable to attain enough votes for the next loan/austerity package. Because even the Parliament will not be able to avoid the rioting Greeks telling them to stop the loans for much longer. When that happens, and Papandreou is unable to get the next loan, he'll give the remaining money left within the government to the banks because that is where his loyalty lies.
0	2	German people invest in banks.   German banks invest in Greece.   Greece did stupid shit and is going down   ???  Bail out to ensure Greece has the chance to pay back. The bail out is far, far less than what is invested
0	2	I think YOU don't understand a lot of things. These problems have nothing to do with the Greek banks, they are not the ones who caused this problems nor are they in any way as exposed as the banks in several other nations. It was the Greek government that took these credits, so yes, this is very much Greek national debt. 
-	-	Yo broski, citation needed.
-	-	I respect what you said. I'm not prejudiced against Greeks, my opinion is based on observation. If anyone has a debt, they should pay it, not someone else. That's all that I'm saying. 
0	1	Eh, but he's right. Rich people fuck up, poor people pay. But if poor people fuck up you bet your ass that they'll squeeze every dime out of you.  In other words: old news.
1	4	Yeah, we (the Greeks) live in our small paradise, driving our Mercedes, drinking uzo by the pool and thinking how we will spend our next 60 years of life after retirement. Clearly you have no idea how life is in Greece, so don't be so fucking sure of your opinion. Try to live with Greek wages in Greece for a year, see for yourself the amazing healthcare, the nice streets, the luxury of everyday life. And you can see in Sintagma how happily they accept the money that have nothing to do with the average Greek citizen. 
0	2	&gt;EU politics are well known for being stunningly irrational, but this really defies logic.  If you have "absolutely no idea" how the bailouts are supposed to work, how can you say whether it is logical or not?  FYI, the bailouts will be used to pay for expired bonds as well as Greek deficit spending. The money that goes into expired bonds will decrease the debt as much as it increases it; the money that goes to deficit spending will increase it. Essentially the expensive loans (bonds) are replaced by a cheaper loan (bailout). 
1	6	It's really simple.  Loan them more than can ever pay, foreclose on the land, the natural resources and create a nation of indentured servants.  How else do you think corporations get sovereignty? 
-	-	There's nothing to add to the discussion. The Greeks acted greedily for several decades and now, instead of suffering through the crisis to repay their debt, they expect everyone to pay for their mistakes. 
-	-	That's simply not true. The Greek economy took a small hit from the global recession, but that is not the reason for the current crisis, at least not directly.   Greece ran a deficit for most of its newer history, it also defaulted several times. This affected their credit rating, just as it would a normal consumer. But when Greece joined the Eurozone (mainly by outright lying about the true state of their economy) they were able to borrow much cheaper then they were used to. This lead to an even bigger deficit. The true extent of this deficit wasn't known until the Socialist gained power and checked the books (Figuratively speaking. Actually they still don't know how much exactly they owe).   Nobody knows when and if they will ever be able to pay back what they owe. But Greece still runs deficits - not just to pay interest, but simply to finance everyday business. Since they openly threaten to default it is quite understandable that no foreign bank wants to lend them more money.  Greece is still spending more then they earn, and the austerity measures imposed on them are mainly designed to change that. I think it is pretty rich to call the IMF, EU and mainly Germany nazis, just because they ask the Greeks to get their house in order. Right now the Greeks are protesting to continue living on other countries expense.   And please, stop with this nonsense about kicking Greece out of the EU. **The EU is NOT the Eurozone.** Is that so hard to understand?
1	6	The whole Nazi argument is ridiculous.  Most people in Greece consider such name calling to be below the belt, and useless.  Much like many voices in Germany calling 11 million people lazy scoundrels are also not voices in the mainstream.

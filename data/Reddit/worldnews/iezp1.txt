1	4	That was a very smart move for the king: he offered a false dicotomy - you want everything to stay as it is or do  you want the king to have less powers? Nowhere in the ballot was the choice to remove the king completely. So if you wanted that option you could vote "no" for the reforms, which puts you on the same boat as monarchists or you could protect on the streets - which other people. Luke accuse you of being against democracy, since you didn't bothered to vote. The king got what he wanted and even if he never gets back the power he lost he set morocco to a slow path to an English like democracy, but probably after the next generation. Even so the king keeps his social status and money, and doesn't need to go throught the trouble of actual king caring for anyone.  Smart move, any king that isn't  a sociopath should follow him.

-	-	Amen brother. That's the exact one I was thinking of!
-	-	If there was no union, Saab would pay their workers as little as they could possibly get away with. Certainly not a "fair wage" as you state. Unions may be bad for business in some cases but they hold businesses accountable for seeing that workers are safe and provided a wage that reflects the work that they do. Perhaps you would be happy if slavery was allowed again?
0	2	Historically they were quite innovative with a lot of different technologies, being at the forefront of introducing them in production models.  These days? They're a car like any other. Except the fact that the company can't handle their finances worth a shit and so it's falling apart.
0	5	GM went bankrupt.  The U.S. government stepped in an basically divided the company into three parts:  What was still making money and could be resurrected into some sort of GM 2.0; what was losing money and would continue to do so ad infinitum (which the government held onto and is slowly writing off); and what they could fold or sell.  In the third group were makes like Saab, Saturn, and Hummer (Pontiac was closed a year before the bankruptcy).  Saab they sold to Spyker, a Dutch firm.  Hummer was sold to a Chinese manufacturer, and Saturn was shut down.  At the time, there was quite a bit of concern as to whether a small-market sports car maker could make a go of a more mainstream brand.  Apparently, we have our answer.  Sadly....
-	-	Antonov makes cars?
-	-	Saabs weren't good quality
-	-	I hope the grocery store and their landlords accept the Saab currency.
-	-	I'm from Trollh√§ttan and what is this?
1	6	They used to be a successful company. I'm not sure what you're talking about.  
-	-	Thaabth are faaabulouth.
1	6	That's what unions are intended to do, but don't always.  After highschool (in Canada) I wanted to be an AME (Aircraft Maintenance Engineer), school was $10-20k a year depending on which, but on the job you are legally accountable for the work you do, and can go to jail for a mistake. You make as much, or often less than an auto-mechanic does, and the airline companies treat you like dirt, forced to work on call through the middle of the night, often sent on trips and sleep in the dirtiest and cheapest motels the company can find.  They are behind a union that all the workers hate, they haven't had a pay raise in ages, after talking to many, I was told it's not something I should get into, many of them regret it and say don't join if you want money, join if you love planes.  As well the best jobs are in the private sector out of the union, for businesses or people that own their own aircraft.
1	4	Lol, in the Netherlands we have a catering union. Workers will since this year only get a pay increase every 4 years and get paid 0% overwork. I have no idea why they still exist if they only serve for the business' agenda.
-	-	Is it hipster too denounce mainstream auto makers? Lol
-	-	One of his 46 Porsche's?
-	-	&gt; Saab admits it cannot pay wages........
0	1	HERE'S YOUR FUCKING RENT  /kitchenwindow
-	-	Damn, I hate when Trollhattan idles.
-	-	Pay them in Saabs :D
1	4	I thought they were finally back on track a month ago. It's a shame, I was hoping to see Saab return to it's pre-GM glory days.
1	8	Cannot or does not want to?  If Saab is sincere they need to open their accounting books to every worker so that they can all decide what to do having all the information at hand.  Business owners lie about their ability to pay all the time.
-	-	Saabs are such strange cars.
-	-	That's a bummer. I loved my saturn ion redline and it was basically a plastic saab. 
-	-	[deleted]
-	-	Bring back the Saab 900 Turbo!
-	-	*Cries*  Sorry, it's just such a saab story.
-	-	A little unrelated but I recently read that gay men were [18 times more likely](http://gaywheels.com/2009/04/lgbt_auto_survey_results/) to drive a Saab than straight men.
1	4	The 2012 Jaguar XKR-S is probably the sexiest looking car I've ever seen.
1	6	I thought Saturn was bought by Spyker?  Edit: Googled it, you're right, but apparently the saturn deal never materialized.
1	6	Off-topic question. What makes Saab cars so good?
-	-	If only Jerry Seinfeld's repairman were a billionaire...
1	4	I loved all my saabs, up untill GM owned them completely.  Saab Viggen FTW!
1	8	Wow, I thought Saab went bankrupt last year...
1	6	What will Jerry Seinfeld drive now?
1	4	They made good quality cars.   Too bad everybody else can do that too. Except the Russians. No, Antonov, you can't buy Saab for the last time. /i
1	4	no worries; they just lost Volvo to China  so they'll sell Saab to India or something...
-	-	thought saab was owned by GM?
1	6	This is why Unions are bad for business. If they were not unionized Saab would have no trouble paying their workers a fair wage. 
-	-	Trollhattan. See there's your problem right there. I will now except payment in the form of Helvetica and Ikea. 
1	4	Jaguar is Indian now and the new models look awesome.  Don't hate just because the parent company isn't European.
-	-	They owned Saab Automobile until last year when Spyker Cars bought them.
1	6	Saab is known for sedans, not sports cars. In fact I don't even think they made a sports car since the GM ownership.
1	6	Saab have lots of models in the UK, not just small-market sports cars. In fact, I can't think of any small Saabs.
-	-	The cars fall apart too.
-	-	Probably more reliable than Itchy &amp; Scratchy money.
-	-	This will give a new definition to the term "Drive-Through Window."
0	2	You have no idea what you are talking about.

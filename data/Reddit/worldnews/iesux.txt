1	4	Thank you!
-	-	If I remember correctly Visa and MasterCard owe Wikileaks at least $15 million. 
0	2	As someone who actually works in Music Publishing and the Music Industry you are completely full of shit.  This "neither the RIAA or any major distributors of music in the western world don't pay artists" is absolutely ridiculous.    I collect royalties for my clients every single quarter from them, and it is meaningful if people actually BUY the music instead of make up bullshit excuses not to. 
-	-	http://i.imgur.com/wN1Ch.png  Note a few things.  1, the size of the scroll bar on the side. This page does not have comments at the bottom. That entire scroll bar is Beatles albums. All sorted by date. (well, Ok, the last 5% is a well written description of the band).  2, those listings are not separate albums. They are separate pressings of the same album. all together there are 10 different version of that album available. All sorted by date. All available in FLAC  3, You can sort by albums, EPs, guest appearances on other albums, singles, compilations containing the artists, etc etc   I can virtually guarantee you that I can find and download anything available on that Russian site on a single bittorent site in under 35 seconds.
-	-	No, because I will actually read the judgement and find out why (if indeed it is thrown out) before saying anything. I was just pointing out you were wrong and that if you had read the article you might not have posted something so stupid.
-	-	Yup - and htey offered multiple formats, up to lossless.  An entirely logical business model (bigger download, pay proportionately more) 
0	2	The US government gives way less of a shit about people outside the US than your own citizens, this is why large chunks of the world doesn't like your country, they repeatedly pull bullshit like that (or much worse) for the benefit of the US at much larger expense to other people, that and the very vocal dumb minority.
-	-	This only means it was a silent changeover and customer records remained live and in-tact.  Done proper but those types of sites and companies seem to change ownership often.

The White House was also on the list, as Bin Laden considered it a political symbol and wanted to attack it as well."
-	-	Wikileaks admits to everything I've stated, so it's not necessary.
-	-	Let me guess, when the lawsuit flounders and is thrown out you will blame that on US intervention and meddling, right?
1	4	That makes perfect sense. Thanks.
-	-	You don't think "Black Hawk Down: Abattabod" would have been a disaster? 
-	-	Our dollar hasn't been backed by gold since before WWII.
-	-	As of January 2011, foreigners owned $4.45 trillion of U.S. debt, or approximately 47% of the debt held by the public of $9.49 trillion and 32% of the total debt of $14.1 trillion.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_public_debt  I'm sure your 0.23 trillion worth of gold will come in handy if times comes to pay your 14 trillion debt.   
-	-	Wikileaks released the info, Wikileaks needs to be prosecuted and made an example of, along with the military guy that gave them the files.
-	-	And exactly how do they guarantee the value of 'this'?  Do they put up the Washington Monument for collateral?
0	1	Yep there was a memo. You must have missed it. They issued it sometime after September 11th.  Now shut the fuck up your sounding kinda muslim-y and unamerican.
-	-	free markets instantaneously form said barriers, thus their practical existence includes them
-	-	Wikileaks Lawyer: "Visa and Mastercard should have exercised social responsibility."  Judge: "Is there a statute or previous case saying that social responsibility applies to this type of situation?"  Wikileaks Lawyer: "I'm not sure."  Judge: "Case dismissed."  Vagueness doesn't win lawsuits.
-	-	The courts are the legislative branch of the government. If the courts order V&amp;M to pay damages to Wikileaks, they will be for lost business rather than matters of censorship - hence a sizeably less significant fine. My prediction for this is, the courts will find that V&amp;M as businesses are free to choose what operations they allow. No fine.  EDIT : I thought the litigation was going to happen on American grounds. Then forget the part about the legislative branch, replace it with something about not pissing off allies.
-	-	&gt;&gt;Am I talking to a Fed?  Nope, just an American.  And what the government does in our names is the responsibility of all Americans - thus I said "we"  Edit: Typos Edit2:  Don't understand the down votes you are getting - I thought your question was perfectly reasonable given my phrasing.
-	-	Really?  That would change things if correct.  Edit: It certainly appears some of the material Bradly Manning is accused of supplying is/was classified  &gt;&gt;Soldier arrested in WikiLeaks classified Iraq video case ... www.csmonitor.com/.../Soldier-arrested-in-WikiLeaks-classified-Ira... - Cached Jun 7, 2010 â€“ Army Spc. Bradley Manning has been arrested in connection with the April release of classified footage of a US helicopter mistakenly ...

-	-	For the sake of argument, I'll consider Europeans part of humanity.
-	-	This is the dumbest of all conspiracies and anyone who believes in it is to be immediately considered a total idiot.
-	-	Seeing how Loose Change completely lied about or misrepresented pretty much [*every single "fact" they gave*](http://www.loosechangeguide.com/LooseChangeGuide.html), I don't give any creedence to any non-Arab involved 9/11 conspiracy.  That's the best evidence Truthers could come up with in four years?  
-	-	Ignoring foreign laws is pretty standard practice for US companies and the US government.  Typically if the offended country is small but makes a big enough issue of it the US invades the country to bring democracy.
0	1	I was saying this as 911 happened when I was 14 years old, conveniently in an international relations class. Taking a building or two down with an airplane is not how terrorism works. Terrorist always have a point to what they do, and very rarely that point is simply 'fuck you'. Look at Fidel Castro, he's a rebel, a terrorist, a revolutionary. Or the classic IRA. True terrorism tries to at least has a point and tries to change something. Osama Bin Laden wasn't dumb and wouldn't make himself a target and now martyr just for a few buildings with zero point to doing it, it doesn't make sense!
-	-	hire a different lawyer.  &gt;Companies would be required to conduct due diligence in order to identify and prevent  "violations of human and environmental rights, corruption or tax evasion, including in their subsidiaries and supply chains";
1	4	A single person boycotting an institution would not (likely) destroy it, but even such a seemingly small act does "hurt it." By definition, if an institution doesn't get money that it would otherwise get, then it has been "hurt," in your words. Even if that amount is a penny.  And trying to make it sound like something is hopeless just so you can justify your apathy or lack of effort is pretty terrible, in my opinion. You shouldn't give your money to a company that does things you disapprove of, no matter exactly how large the impact will be on it's bottom line. Doing something because it's right, not because it's significant, is pretty much the definition of integrity.
-	-	Actually, I have been forced to use a credit card. For the past couple of years all of my student loan disbursement money has been distributed via a Visa branded ATM card. I've had no choice in the matter. My school decided that student loans would be disbursed in this manner, mailed me a card instead of a check, and if I want to get my loan money I need to go to an ATM that accepts Visa cards.
0	1	So basically your only guarantee under the Constitution you're all so proud of is that they won't *directly* restrict your speech.  Indirectly, they'll do whatever the fuck they want, same as always.
-	-	Then constitutional protections mean nothing, nothing at all but a little extra effort to work your way around them.  The intent here appears to be the restriction of speech.  This is *not okay.*
-	-	Not *phat* fingers on your iPhone?
-	-	the. Goddammit. 
1	6	Why wouldn't other treaties count also?  For example I'm sure we have a treaty with European nations about security/NATO/intelligence gather  etc?
-	-	Violating U.S. law is pretty clear cut. No matter how they got it, it violates U.S. law to distribute classified data. If I copied and pasted from the Wikileaks site right now, I could violate the law.  Now, should a country be able to enforce its laws outside the country?  That's another topic.
-	-	I have no doubt it is difficult and complicated or we would already have done it.  
1	4	Hurr durr, Assange giving Bradley a large sum of money would not look good at Manning's trial, there is no connection between Manning and Assange.  They would like to keep it that way until the trial is over.  
-	-	Jesus, would you stop already with this nerd currency circlejerk.  Last week when someone hacked the system, your currency fell from $17 to $0 overnight. People need stability, backed by a real reserve of assets, not some imaginary property that someone generated with their GPU and a whole lot of electricity.  The only ones winning with bitcoins are the power companies.
-	-	Up vote for subtlety.    Successful troll is successful.
-	-	troll detected
-	-	Which news organisation are you going to start with?
-	-	You're the one who sees it as a game, not them.
1	4	&gt; Instead of downvoting, prove me wrong.  I didn't downvote you, but I would like to say that you can't disprove an opinion. Nearly all of what you said is opinion that can't be proved or disproved.
1	4	I think Assange is a difficult personality, but Wikileaks has made significant impact with him at the helm. This is an undeniable fact.  I would agree that Assange is calculating, however, I see this as a positive quality. He is fighting people that are authoring all sorts of brutalities, and I would personally want the biggest cunt in the universe fighting *for* my interests rather than against them. Politics is a *very* dirty game - expecting Assange to be a saint here is ludicrous.  I think there's a big difference between liking and respecting a person and acknowledging their success. Assange is not very likeable, but he is highly effective at what he does. I hope he continues being a prick, because it's obviously working for him (and us).
1	4	Everyone responding to posts like this with a serious comment, you're most likely encouraging trolls.
-	-	Not that big of an issue.  How many people were killed today in the mid-east and Africa due to the struggles there?
-	-	meanwhile Bradley Mannng is still incarcerated. Has Julian Assange helped that soldier in anyway?
-	-	If only Bitcoins were more popular...  (this whole thing never could have happened!)  Check out [r/BitcoinMining](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining) to learn how to make some with your spare video card when you are not gaming to the max.  Then you can donate them to WikiLeaks! [http://www.wikileaks.org/Donate.html](http://www.wikileaks.org/Donate.html)
1	6	What a douche
-	-	Screw Wikileaks. Round up those responsible for disclosing classified information and toss them in jail. If they want to play games, I'm sure the US government is quite willing to accommodate them.
1	4	Funny story about Visa/Mastercard. Their president wants to be responsable for destroying hard currency.   Before he was president of Visa/Mastercard, he was president of Nestle. Where he wanted to gain control of the world's entire potable water supply.     Ruminate on the implications of this.
-	-	I think those companies have the right to choose with whom they do business.
-	-	Wikileaks has no chance.  American companies have the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason.
-	-	I am Julian Assange, feed me publicity om nom nom nom.
1	4	I find Julian Assange a very calculating and scheming man, not to mention greedy. He promised Bradley Manning money for his defence, in reality he gave him a miserly $15,000, in the situation he is in, that is nothing.  If Wikileaks were under better leadership it could do more good than it is right at this minute in time.  As it stands,  by not delivering on his promises and being the Media whore he is Assange is making Wikileaks look nothing more than the worlds biggest blackmailing scheme.  EDIT: Instead of downvoting, prove me wrong.
-	-	why is this not #1 on the front page. This is a big damn issue.
1	4	Well, they do, but the things they admit to are actually legal in the United States (and -in fact- in all western countries). Last time there was a situation like this (Watergate scandal), eventually the president at the time (Nixon) had to resign, whilst the New York Time still exists to this day.
1	4	It'll be a hell of a lot more handy than an encrypted file that 3 previous owners said was "just like real money".
-	-	if that's the case then oversight could also be included.
-	-	I'm all for being enlightened, put it all on the table. Do you have sources?  I'm saying the comparison is not fair, between Al Qaeda and WikiLeaks, they're NOT the same. Being a private company Visa and MC have rights, yes, but being international financial establishments their clients have rights as well and having accounts frozen before any judgement is made does not hold water.
-	-	You think newspapers have only ever released classified information from Wikileaks?
-	-	Who is going to prosecute Wikileaks? You're a moron.
-	-	I suppose there is an argument to be had here and that's kind of what the court case is for.  I doubt that the law is on their side, hell the parent poster pointed out the issues...).
-	-	They do however risk being kicked out of or being fined in other countries for breaking their business laws. It is a no win situation for them in some sense.
1	6	If someone is under investigation I'm all for preventing them access to their money. However, what happened here is that Visa shut down their accounts and took all their money without even a single charge filed against Wikileaks. Why hasn't Wikileaks been charged with anything in the US? Probably because they haven't done anything illegal...
-	-	I don't agree with denying financial funds to organizations or people without some sort of proof of wrong doing.  Also, there is no such thing as Al Qaeda. Nobody was donating to Al Qaeda.  You are an idiot.
-	-	Well yeah, basically.  If you want to support the artists who make music, buy their T shirts, or go to their shows, or mail them a check, or donate on papal, or but their music directly from them. You aren't doing them any favors by sending a dollar to a shady Russian website. The only people who benefit from that are people who run shady Russian websites.
1	6	Good. I hope Wikileaks wins. What Visa and MasterCard did was a blatant and obscene violation of free speech. They should be ashamed of themselves for acting in such an atrocious manner and I feel a draconian punishment for corporations who act this way is more than appropriate.
-	-	Which one is he president of? Visa and Mastercard are separate companies.  I know they are interested in supplanting other forms of payment, Mastercard as been interested in doing that for the past 10 years.
1	6	That would be great if Visa/Mastercard weren't two of the largest players in credit/debit card transaction networks. They are stopping millions (billions?) of people from donating to an organisation that doesn't appear to have broken a law and has certainly not been charged and tried with such.  Visa/MC are blocking payments to Wikileaks. So, if I wanted to, I can't use my Visa debit card to donate to them, neither could I use my Mastercard credit card. Why can't I choose where my money goes?  I can't really choose not to have a Visa card, either - all of the UK banks seem to be issuing Visa debit cards these days. When you're a monopoly or part of a oligopoly, you shouldn't be able to choose who you deal with.  This is assuming that Visa/MC are doing it out of their own volition and not if the US government is telling them what to do. That's the problem when you have American dominance in important industries - the US government tries to use them to implement their laws outside their borders. I am not a US citizen, Wikileaks (IIRC) is not a US organisation, so why is the US government stopping me from donating my (non-US) money to them?
-	-	A suit in Europe going to scotus, has the  NWO really come this far? 
-	-	It is possible they can be denied having the right to do business in other countries. Costing them billions.
1	4	(d) apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage;  That would be it right there. They are refusing to allow transactions to this company for no reason. That is applying dissimilar conditions (i.e. your company cannot be these two cause we dont like you) and thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage.
1	6	&gt;What wikileaks did was considered illegal  No, it wasn't. Certainly not by EU (or any member country) law, and arguably not by US law. And nothing has been proven in any court, so it's all speculative. 
-	-	its not illegal but people dont sue eachother for "illegal" things. there's a bit of difference.
1	6	&gt;What wikileaks did was considered illegal  Who by?
1	6	When you have that sort of exclusivity in banking and money you create an even bigger divide between the haves and the have-nots.   What can you do when no institution will allow you to have wages paid into your account or bills to be paid through your account?
-	-	Glad to see some common sense. As much as I support Wikileaks, come on guys/gals, the company has the right to choose not to provide service to them.  So they support freedom only when it has no negative effects on their organization?  And the way to thwart that freedom is to try to use the law as a weapon?  Huh... I'm having deja vu here.  EDIT: PS common sense in the r/worldnews comments is the reason it's the only "big" subreddit I subscibe to. One of the best parts of this website. (tho I've learned to avoid the Fukushima discussions...)
1	4	I live in Texas, (I know bad karma already) but here you cant deny service because of race or color, but you can for just not liking somone. Its the same for big companies.   I'll say this, one the one hand, if the US suggested they do it, its not illigal, but in poor taste.   Just like when WikiLeaks took documents marked Secret and higher and published them to the world, in several instances putting troops in Afganistan (not just American troops) at risk. Not illigal, but in poor taste.
-	-	free market means no entry or exit barrier. if that's the case then anyone can print their money and let the market decide what those are valued financially (aka real version of bitcoins or bottle caps in Fallout). we wont be stuck with having our balls in the hands of these current bastards. This is inherently not a free market and hence has to have oversight.
-	-	So, MC/Visa will also have to stop all transactions with The New York Times, right? 
-	-	Yeah the state department has about as much power to declare something illegal as i do. All they really did was issue an *opinion*.
-	-	And what law was broken again? I only ask because no one has been charge, because various newspapers published the same information and because wikileaks wasn't involved in obtaining the information, nor bound by any agreement with the US government on secrecy.
-	-	US civil rights law makes it clear what is considered a protected class. Gender, race, etc are protected so no you can't discrementate based on that. Which has nothing to do with this case.
1	4	 christ... it's people like you that lower the general level of discourse on reddit. I don't even refer to the nature or validity of the comment... just the manner of your rebuke is such tripe that I think don't votes don't express enough. 
0	3	I only downvoted you because of your edit. Insults and whining don't add anything.  Back on topic...  Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for numerous acts which caused injury, loss of life, and serious damage to others' properties. It's hard to call them much other than a religiously fanatical terrorist organization.  I would define Wikileaks as a whistle blowing support organization. I think their role is similar, if not exactly identical to, the role The New York Times  played for Ellsberg when it published the Pentagon Papers. Would you say that The New York Times' funds should have been frozen and/or their accounts closed? How then could they have afforded legal counsel to fight the charges made by the government?
1	4	So the U.S. State department can make and enforce their own laws now? Did I miss a new 4th branch of government memo?  Is this like monopoly where the U.S. State department says something and you skip go and go directly to jail?
-	-	That's the thing, the state department doesn't have the authority to declare it illegal.
0	1	I'm so glad to hear this. What they did was a fucking U.S.-led cartel. This was the creepiest, most disturbing thing the American government has done in the past 10 years.
-	-	1. The laws probably were distributing classified data and obstruction of justice.  2. I am unaware of any indictment.  Edit: As a side comment, I doubt an indictment was needed to convince Visa and Mastercard.  Consider the fine that Google is about to have to pay for simply allowing spam advertising about pharmaceuticals (mainly viagra) - lots of the spammers have not been indicted but Google is being punished for helping them.  For spam, its just a fine but I bet Visa stock holders wanted to make sure Visa cooperated and was not indicted over wikileaks.
-	-	they're "persons" where I come from    http://www.commondreams.org/view/2011/07/01-14
-	-	Fair point.
-	-	As far as I know, they have not been charged.
1	4	I didn't realize European Visa was 100% European owned when I posted - if they are EU only, then that will likely mean that it will be European laws about cooperation with the U.S. and European banking regulations - topics I know little about.
-	-	Agreed - I was going over types of boycotts that would be illegal under U.S. law - that was before I understood that Visa Europe is not part of Visa but is owned exclusively by European Banks - I am almost completely unfamiliar with EU law 
0	2	I hate to be that guy, but its allowed, not aloud.
1	4	Hmm thanks for that post  - i just learned something  &gt;&gt;Visa Europe is owned, controlled and operated by its members â€“ more than 4,000 banks and other payment service providers in 36 countries across Europe.  &gt;&gt;We are the payment industryâ€™s only pan-European membership association. Our members decide on our strategic direction, our investments and our innovations.  I'm not sure how the U.S. could stop them from taki8ng non-U.S. payments from non-Americans - my guess is that European governments must be involved.  
-	-	If they *think* you're engaging in illegal shit, they can stop funds going to you. Visa/Mastercard could still be wrong and you could still, legally, have funds stopped to you by these private entities.
-	-	facilitaing a known enitity conducting espionage properly. gotta be a law frowning on it.
-	-	How do you know?
-	-	I'm afraid it won't :(
0	5	If it goes through, my faith in Europe will continue. My faith in humanity, sadly, remains unchanged.
0	2	Those aren't creepy; they're geopolitical calculations done out of rage (Afghanistan) and cold manipulation of facts (Iraq). Neither is really disturbing--more disgusting.
-	-	True, but of course, they violated more that that.
0	1	If they want my business, they do. The only way we, as a nation, can stop the trampling of our civil liberties by the wealthy is by holding them accountable for their misbehavior. Be it with my dollar votes or though court order, when they fuck up and do something that is blatantly abusive society must hold them accountable.
-	-	Perhaps not legally, but it still would require ignoring all ethical concerns. Just because it is possible, even permissible, to do something, doesn't mean that it is right. And it definitely doesn't mean that their actions cannot incur penalties beyond legal ramifications...it is the duty of everyone who values freedom of speech to ensure that companies that collude to oppose it are financially affected, at least in some small way, by their decision.
0	1	Not entirely true.  Under EU law, companies that have a de-facto dominant position in a market are required to go beyond respecting the letter of EU law. They are required to exercise "social responsibility" (whatever the fuck that means) due to the potential negative effects of their market dominance.
-	-	allowed
-	-	And when the government imposes sanctions on companies (also known as arm twisting), so they have no choice but to cease business with certain organizations, what would you call that ?
-	-	&gt; **except** US-related news
-	-	We are looking at masterminds here. Manipulators of law and bringing forward the untold truth that governments hide from us. The truth will prevail.
1	4	This reminds me of how I wish I could financially support the hacker groups when they hack into something I enjoy!  Does anyone else feel this urge?  I like what the majority of those groups were doing and I wanted to financially support it.

-	-	Good Luck with that.  I hope it goes to the supreme Court.
-	-	I'm curious what advantage blocking donations gave VISA and MasterCard?
-	-	According to the corrupt supreme court, money is protected free speech. It's unconstitutional to restrict donations to Wikileaks.
0	1	fuck wkileaks that website is the worst website out there, its worse than the westboro baptist church, and coming from a marine who'se had them arrive at a funeral i was at thats saying something. that shit isn't public knowledge for a good reason 
1	4	Article 101:  &gt;1. The following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market: all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market, and in particular those which: (a) directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions; (b) limit or control production, markets, technical development, or investment; (c) share markets or sources of supply; (d) apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage; (e) make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts. 2.

Can someone point out were Visa broke the law? What wikileaks did was considered illegal and visa dint wanna help them out. There is also a difference between a monopoly and donating.  This is a huge waste of time and possibly money by wikileaks. 
1	4	I agree. I really think the US response to wikileaks was a bit like someone driving a car and being stung by a bee. Rather than calmly pull over, we just started flipping shit and swerving all over the road. 
-	-	Maybe I misread the article. Are you saying in Europe a company can be forced to take on anyone as a customer? That doesn't seem to make any sense, but I am American.
1	4	It will be interesting.   Like a lot of other people, I have mixed feelings about Wikileaks - I'm glad to know a lot of the leaks but I also understand why we have classified data and why we cooperate with allies when its a U.S. company involved.
1	8	Ah, sorry, I was locked in another mindset and overreacted.
-	-	You really don't see the difference between a legal spat between Visa, Mastercard &amp; Datacell and what this is?  Ask Intel about the difference.  Ask Microsoft about the difference.  Ask Samsung about the difference.

1	4	i lold because try and seed anything that isn't fl byebye good luck
1	4	I agree and disagree with you here. I think that, on a moral level, you are completely correct but I think that on another level, you have the government flipping shit about some website airing their dirty laundry and acting in a way that, at the spur of the moment (read: without thinking for 2 seconds) they thought would protect them from bad shit coming about as a result.   All and all just a poorly handled mess that made us look like fools in about 3000 different ways. 
-	-	No, and I think thats why I am having trouble ascertaining what the proper response here is. 
-	-	So, basically, you are just piss-poor at accurately expressing yourself, expect us to decipher your confusing sentiment, and then claim we are in the wrong for wanting you to 'explain yourself'.
0	3	Trying to strike fear doesn't make you a terrorist, using fear to effect change is what makes you one.

0	3	I deleted it because I misread osama for obama, hilarious eh? why so srs?  And believe what you want about the sniper dude, he didn't have a clear motive and no friends to support him, he was a rogue psycho which by nature induces fear. He is a terrorist in the same sense a rabid dog is a terrorist.
-	-	that text you quoted didn't come from either one of those articles, where did it come from?
-	-	if you admit it's not right how does comparing their actions to real polti justify them?
0	2	I think the part that gets to people is that it shows corporations like Visa/Mastercard really can get whatever they want, they can pass whatever laws they need to kill competition, and can use their power to screw over the consumers (us).  The government should work for the people, not for the multi-million dollar corporations.
-	-	They're in violation of no law, foreign or domestic?  Are you kidding me?  They released thousands and thousands of secret documents, and you don't think they've broken any laws?  Wikileaks may be doing the right thing, but they're definitely on the wrong side of the law.
-	-	Fines.
-	-	Sure little boy come sit on the papal robes. 
0	1	Sure, but when they overstep looking out for their citizens interests and actively make other peoples lives worse just at the expense of making Americans lives marginally better off, they lose any damn respect from me. That is completely immoral and makes my blood boil. They're like the ultimate school yard bullies, and who the fuck likes them?
-	-	When a country wants to be a superpower who influences all the world's people, then they have a responsibility towards all of the world's people, not just their own. If America wants to be 'the leader of the free world' then they have a responsibility to act up to that name. 
0	1	&gt; Isn't protecting a nation's citizens and interests the government's main, if not sole, reason for being?  Yes and no. The government *should* protect the citizens' interests. This is not what is happening. It protecting solely a few big corporations, those with political power. So the government is only protecting itself, and the other citizens can go an fuck themselves.  Also, slapping a label on it: hey it's just Realpolitik, or power politics doesn't make it right.
-	-	&gt;These companies have no legal, ethical, or moral obilgation to "stick it to the man" or make any kind of political statement by continuing to support him. They are in a business to make money.  Company's have no duty to act legally? They have no imperative to act in a moral fashion?  The argument you present is one that is exceptionally worrying.  On that basis, a soldier in a war-zone has no imperative to act in a manner other than as ordered, an employee has no moral or ethical requirement to act in a manner that is safe, other than as mandated by their employer.  No one need do anything if they are under pressure or if it might harm their personal interests in terms of income or security.  Personally I think that these company's do have to be held to account, now, by anyone who can do that so that next time they do act ethically, morally and legally..
-	-	Accomplices to the theft of secret government documents aren't using free speech. They're aiding and abetting crimes.
0	2	I'm not sure why you're being downvoted.  It may not be popular on reddit, I may hate it myself, but that is how the law operates.  As long as the DoJ is trying to pin Assange, I don't this case going anywhere.  &gt;Visa and Master card have 70 and 25 percent of the market share in Europe  I also don't expect a whole lot in going after the payment processing monopoly.  I hope wikileaks the best, but if you really want to support wikileaks and hurt visa and mastercard, start using bitcoin and donate that way.
-	-	Well, for them to risk "civil and criminal penalties under US law" Wikileaks would have to have done something illegal. AFAIK, nobody has demonstrated that they have. No charges have been filed against Wikileaks. The US government has shown nothing to indicate that they have anything to charge them with.
-	-	I would not call allowing transaction of money between parties 'support'.
-	-	I don't blame the credit companies, I blame the U.S. government for leaning on them.  Imagine if that happened to an individual; if suddenly no credit card company or bank would do business with you because a couple of politicians say your name is mud.
-	-	Business-wise, the KKK is also battery-acid. They could sidestep that issue by saying that their payment network doesn't censor based on people's political beliefs or actions unless told to by a court of law. Sadly I think they just just, uh, completely blew that excuse away by arbitrarily refusing payment to Wikileaks - not based on an actual US government ruling made by a court but on the legally non-binding advice of a few senators.
-	-	That's the thing though, if no one stands up, then they run roughshod over everyone. Principles aren't just for when it's convenient.
-	-	This will not end well.
-	-	Well thats why you sue people, to prove something. So yes, for the time being they are innocent. Once they are sued, or however the EU rules/determines these things, we will know if they have been deemed guilty or innocent in their actions.
-	-	The problem is that Manning broke the law. Assange has not. He can of course protest treatment on Mannings but he did commit a crime.
1	6	Has any member of Wikileaks been proven guilty and convicted of any crime that you speak of in a court of law? Innocent until proven guilty. Another fantastic pillar of a fair society that sets modern civilisations aside from the rest.
-	-	Did that 'damage' America?
-	-	The federal reserve has 1 trillion dollars (Actually assets of 2.3 trillion, and liabilities of 1.3 trillion) ... that is a *real* reserve. You know, the same reserve that bailed out your banks, and took on 1/5th of the US mortgages when the system fell apart.  You can only do that with *real* currency that has not only a "perceived" value, but an actual country backing it up and saying "we guarantee the value of this".
-	-	That was not the question.
1	8	He has personally protested against the treatment Manning is receiving and has donated to the Manning legal defense fund.  We just don't get to see the degree to which he has championed Mannings situation because our government still considers him an enemy of the state.  His hands are fairly well tied at this point.  Wikileaks and Assange acting as their spokesman can not as it would compromise their objectivity.   It is a tricky situation.  Don't expect anything to come from Wikileaks front page unless some clear evidence is handed to them that they can publish.  edit:  sorry should have been more clear about whether I was talking about Assange the man or Assange the spokesman.
1	8	Sorry, I'm not convinced.  I'd still take the 228 billion gold reserves in Fort Knox over your Matabele Gumbo Beads any day, which are backed by ... who or what exactly ?
1	4	allofmp3.com was like a Russian iTunes type site. They sold music for about 10 cents a song. They also offered a variety of formats including lossless FLAC formats.  They paid royalties to ROM which is the Russian equivelent of the RIAA. However the RIAA were unhappy because although they were paying the correct amount of royalites required under Russian law the RIAA wanted more so they refused to even collect the royalties that had been paid to ROMs.  The RIAA then lobbied the US government to put pressure on VISA, Mastercard, Paypal and anyone else based in the US that offered a  payment option to allofmp3.com.  The above is from memory so feel free to google it for more information.
1	4	So what? It still lists the laws that they will seek to prove Visa/Matercard has broken. These laws, which you can lookup yourself if you don't like the linked site, show that you are talking nonsense.
-	-	Well Mastercard and Visa are also innocent then.
1	4	So... anyone feel like storming Quantico?
1	4	Well that's what he's asking: has Julian Assange been protesting for the guy? "Helping him in any way would be seen as admission..." All of a sudden Assange is supposed to be worried about what people will think?  Assange's complete MO is to not care about what people think, or worry about how things will be seen, no matter what. This is the only reason the guy is relevant.   All of a sudden he can't protest for fear of how that might be construed? Sounds like a double standard; double standards beget more double standards, which eventually snowball into all-out corruption. It's the classic slippery slope syndrome--which has happened to every nation since the beginning of history. The minute we start allowing him to adopt a double standard, we begin to "aid and abet" him into becoming exactly what the US government is being accused of more and more all over the world: ostensibly doing what's best for foreign entities, but actually doing what's best for America (oil interests, etc.)  If Assange doesn't do exactly the utmost that he can to help Bradley (even at the cost of his own certain demise), then he will be operating in reaction to what does and doesn't hurt himself, which equals only doing what's in his own best interest. When you start putting yourself ahead like that, you start yourself down the usual, inevitable, inexorable decline into corruption.  Assange needs for us to give him a good shaking and say, "Man! I know things are tough, but you knew that they could get this way. What you're doing--going up against one of the historically most powerful countries in the world--was bound to get you in the hot water that you're in. By backing down on helping people like Bradley in any way that you can, you're simply confirming what the naysayers have been saying all along: when the going gets tough, you'll start backing down."

1	6	What exactly became of these funds?  Did Visa and MC essentially take people's money, then keep it rather than either delivering it to the intended party or returning it?  If so, doesn't that warrant some type of theft charges be filed?
-	-	With all the work wikileaks does i wouldn't doubt they have some of the best lawyers in the world, i hope it turns out well for them.
0	5	Fantastic, fantastic news. I donated with my MasterCard and was sad when they blocked donations just a few days afterwards... maybe my money never even reached them, how can I tell?  I wrote emails to both MC and Visa to complain. I got no response. 
-	-	Visa and MC did not violate a contract, wikileaks did (morality/disrepute which both organizations reserve the right to terminate for). In addition wikileaks, the government or indeed anyone else has no standing nor any right to force one organization to do business with another.  They are not preventing wikileaks from receiving donations, they are not actively obstructing their "business" and they are not advocating that other organizations refuse to do business with wikileaks. Irrespective of what their reasons were the fact people seem to be missing is that if Mastercard and VISA (both US based organisations) continue to do business with wikileaks they were risking their own organizations to civil and criminal penalties under US law. You might be able to say they should have fought for wikileaks but you certainly can't assume that liability for them or force them to assume that liability.
-	-	The astounding level of naivete in every wikileaks threads never fails to give me a chuckle with my morning coffee.   
-	-	[Priceless](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzMN2c24Y1s&amp;sns=fb).
0	1	Here's the way I look at it.  Wikileaks is in the right.  They are in violation of no law, foreign or domestic, and are victims of nothing more than a government-sanctioned witch hunt because the information they are leaking are damning to various powerful governments and corporations around the world.  I believe the charges, including the sexual assault charges, are completely trumped up and were fabricated to discredit Assange and give the police a reason to detain and arrest him.  **BUT**  I don't blame Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Amazon, or any of the other long list of companies that ultimately stopped providing services to him.  They were all under tremendous pressure from the most powerful government in the world -- a government that had the power completely ruin their business, arrest CEOs, etc.  It's no surprise that they all found any reason they could come up with to distance themselves from Wikileaks.  It's easy to say they should have "stood up to the government" and continued to support Wikileaks from the other side of a computer screen, sitting in your chair, when there are no consequences for your words and decisions.    But when you've got millions (billions?) of dollars on the line, an angry government threatening anything and everything they could throw at you, pressure from stockholders, boards of directors, etc., and your personal freedom in jeopardy if you choose not to comply, I'll bet my left nut that every single one of you would do the exact same thing that these companies did; comply with government demands, cut off services to Wikileaks, and distance themselves from the situation as much as they could.  These companies have no legal, ethical, or moral obilgation to "stick it to the man" or make any kind of political statement by continuing to support him.  They are in a business to make money.  Business-wise, Wikileaks is battery acid.  They're doing the smart thing -- sitting back with their popcorn and watching the shitstorm from the rafters.  Once the political pressure from various powerful governments is removed, I'm willing to bet that these companies will continue to do business with Wikileaks again.  If not, I'll gladly grab my torch and pitchfork.

1	4	Other treaties may count in some sense, but the complaint is to be lodged with DG-IV (the European Competition Commission) citing violation of specific EU laws with respect to abuse of a dominant market position.  If Visa and Mastercard want to argue some principle of 'greater good' then I suppose they can if they want, but whether DG-IV gives a shit about their ideas is another matter.
-	-	&gt;Violating U.S. law is pretty clear cut. No matter how they got it, it violates U.S. law to distribute classified data.  Absolutely not. WikiLeaks is not in violation of ANY US law. They have not been charged in the United States of anything (or any other country).   &gt;violates U.S. law to distribute classified data  The Supreme Court has already ruled on this. The NY Times published the Pentagon Papers, classified Top Secret. The US government sued to stop this.  &gt;New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971), was a United States Supreme Court per curiam decision. *The ruling made it possible for the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers to publish the then-classified Pentagon Papers without risk of government censure.*  &gt;President Richard Nixon had claimed executive authority to force the Times to suspend publication of classified information in its possession. The question before the court was whether the constitutional freedom of the press, guaranteed by the First Amendment, was subordinate to a claimed need of the executive branch of government to maintain the secrecy of information. *The Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment did protect the right of the New York Times' to print the materials.*  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._United_States
-	-	If you've ever read the amendments, they begin with  "Congress shall make no law...".  So yes, they can't directly restrict your speech, and in this case, they haven't. I'm not arguing how it should be, I'm just telling you how it is. 
-	-	Reddit does have an edit button you know....
-	-	&gt; Except, in the EU, there are laws against payment providers acting this way.  The EU rules are even clearer on this issue, even suspecting illegal activity requires them to suspend an account. On the US side its optional to avoid liability for the offense itself. In the EU you must act, in the US you only need to act if you believe not acting would rise to conspiracy.
-	-	Yeah, I agree that that is a serious problem.
0	2	A nation of people who understand their government is actively looking to twist, sabotage or subvert its own legal system in order to prosecute a man who has committed no crime disgust me.
-	-	Bradley Mannings is a different case. He took action to take secret data. Which is illegal. Wikileaks was given this data which is not illegal as they where not involved in the taking of the data from the government.  If you think about it it would be kinda silly to prosecute on distributing secrets and certainly unconstitutional. Imagine if somebody found out about something and then told lots of people. Those people would tell other people. Does it makes sense to prosecute those people who talk about the secret?
-	-	Can you name a few?
-	-	that's ridiculous
-	-	As if boycotting a financial transaction service is actually going to hurt it?
-	-	Boycotting works both ways. Paypal was boycotting wikileaks. 
-	-	Shady for sure, but not a constitutional violation of free speech.
-	-	Obviously they don't care too much about your business. You're probably still using their services even with them blocking donations to Wikileaks. Nobody is forcing you use a credit card.
-	-	Fat fingers on my iPhone. You are correct though. 
1	6	What sanctions did the government impose?
-	-	Because most people here are dense to the fact that many European governments also wanted Wikileaks crushed, and that it wasn't just solely the work of the big ol' evil United States of America.
-	-	Fat fingers on my iPhone. You are technically correct, e best kind of correct 
-	-	yeah, it was /s
-	-	Ownership is unimportant, as is the 'nationality' of the parent company. They are incorporated in the EEA and their activities within the region are subject to to EU law.  The complaint has nothing to do with cooperation between the EU and the US or any banking regulations, but rather Visa/Mastercard's violations of Articles 101 &amp; 102 of the Treaty on the Operation of the EU.
1	4	When you set yourselves up so you become a virtual duopoly (with a lot of international government help regulation wise) , you should lose the right to chose who you do business with. Aka unless they have actually broken the law you must do business with them because there are no real other options. And with way all governments are pushing for a cashless society it's only going to get worse.   "morality/disrepute" clauses are a joke that translate into "because we felt like it", otherwise Visa and MC would have stopped processing payments for porn and alcohol a long time ago due to the perceptions of large portions of the planet.  Visa/MC need to decide what they are, international independent financial organisations who's only mission is facilitating payments or part of the US governments arsenal to enforce their political will internationally.   So then the rest of the world can decide if they want those two (and thus the USA) virtually running large potions of the local financial system or if they want to set up an alternative
1	4	Most of these people seem to have never actually left the nest because they hold some seriously confused beliefs about how the world works. This stuff about the USA being the most evil nation in human history is especially funny.
-	-	To paraphrase Lenin, the capitalist will sell us the ethernet cord with which we will busy ourselves
-	-	Unfortunately, the Icelandic lawyer mentioned is a rather big joke. He's a "celebrity" lawyer with a terrible track record. His claim to fame was an OJ Simpson esque case where he got an obviously guilty man acquitted. He has connections to one of the DataCell guys, which is probably the reason he is on the case.
-	-	Do you know how credit cards work... The money is immediately deposited into the merchants account...nothing was stolen...
1	4	No, corporations aren't alive, much less human. But they act like sociopaths.
-	-	&gt;But when a company is participating in violating American law, the government can usually forbid American companies from helping.  Which law was being violated? Could you point me at the indictment?
-	-	Oh, I didn't realise wikileaks had been charged?
-	-	Visa Europe and MasterCard Europe are independent companies, not US based. If Wikileaks' merchant account isn't with a US bank (I'm sure it's not), their processing won't be with the US card networks but the European ones.
-	-	&gt;  they were risking their own organizations to civil and criminal penalties under US law.       Could you elaborate on that? I'm not familiar with US Law.
-	-	I'm not convinced there are legal ground for the suit.   American companies generally cannot participate in a boycott of a foreign country unless the government initiates it.  But when a company is participating in violating American law, the government can usually forbid American companies from helping.    
-	-	They also did it to allofmp3.com even though they were breaking no laws in their home country.
-	-	No hegemony lasts forever; they will fall.
0	1	Sure, now let's put that in context.  They enacted war-no, murder on hundreds of thousands of Iraqis despite the protests of it's own citizens all while claiming to be the land of the free.  All while claiming that the American citizens know what's best.    When will we stop fooling ourselves into thinking that America isn't and has not always been a terrorist state founded on seizing assets, landbases and resources by force, extortion and coercion?    America (and it's economic allies) is the Evil-Fucking-Empire from Star Wars and we should all be held accountable for it's actions.    It's no longer the good deeds you *do* that make you a good person, we need to start judging people by the good deeds that they *don't* do, namely: doing everything in their power and creativity to stop the destruction, rapine and psychopaths who are in charge of this monster truck. Holy Fuck!

-	-	I refuse to engage anyone who tells me to wake up. The things you listed were offensive, but not shocking in light of what america has done in its own interests historically.
0	1	It's definitely not the worse. I mean, the "War on Terror" was certainly much more devastating than this.  However, since this happened in Europe, and everyone gets upset. Rightfully so, might I add. Visa, though American, was doing business in European soil, with European companies. There are laws that protect these companies, local and international laws. The actions of the US effectively say this to Europeans "We don't give a fuck about your laws, our companies are going to act however we see fit. We are above your laws."  Also, note that while the US was the one with the most info released, many other countries were affected, but none of them threw a hissy fit. Mostly because these countries had less to hide, and even less political power.
-	-	None of the information was classified. It was "secret".
-	-	Yeah, where is this outrage coming from, subby?  And perhaps you can clarify, because the action is against Mastercard, not the US.  So you'd rather Mastercard buckle to some fru-fru foreign lawsuit than to cooperate with the feds?  How is this better?
-	-	"we"? Am I talking to a Fed? oh boy oh boy oh boy what info do you guise have on me?
0	1	Yes except him.  "hey I'm thinking shooting some of these cocksuckers what do you think?"  "that would be fucking awesome I was thinking the same thing!"  "lets setup a nest in our car and do it!"  "I'll get the tools, you get the gun"   terrorism at it's finest.
-	-	Well, your response to my quip was saying that this isn't a lawsuit. The article is using terms (suing, prosecution, complaint) that indicates it is a lawsuit. So is this an administrative proceeding? A legislative activity? If it's not a lawsuit, it has to be something else.
0	5	Not exactly, I am saying in Europe a company can be forced to take on (A) as a customer if not doing so places (A) at a competitive disadvantage.
1	4	I don't think you can really 'chose' to be a superpower though. I totally get what you're saying but after the Cold War, it wasn't like there were really any other options.

1	4	You sir are spouting the words of a lifestyle anarchist, the worst kind of all!  It's like saying, oh, you don't like the US military?  Don't join it.  Oh, you don't like Xe?  Don't invest in it.  You don't like Coca-Cola?  Don't drink it.  It's never as simple as boycotting, and boycotting is so ineffectual in comparison the dominance that industry has over our lives.  To pretend that simply not buying a product hurts a company, when they make more money than you can imagine in tax breaks, collusory tactics etc. is ignorant and incrementalist.  You call me apathetic and lacking effort, but forget that the tactic you are backing plays into the hands of the ruling class.

This all happened before anyone even knew who he was.  This is my response:  You are *spectacularly* ignorant.  Osama bin Laden was put on the FBI's Most Wanted list in *1999*.

1	4	With a name like that I don't know whether to downvote or upvote.
-	-	&gt; WikiLeaks and Datacell (a service provider assisting WikiLeaks) are to sue Visa &amp; MasterCard for engaging in an unlawful, U.S. influenced, financial blockade.  &gt; **to sue**  They're suing but it's not a lawsuit?
-	-	So you support Monsanto by purchasing their products while claiming that they are a faithless company?  It's hard to debate a semantic point with someone who is so comfortable in their inconsistency.

0	1	The beltway sniper was a single pissed off redneck... he wasn't a terrorist, he was a serial killer. And when you say "through striking fear", I believe something different, I believe "an example of desperation" because I seek peace not justice. Because the fact of the matter is, "The ultimate goal was to get rid of American influence in the middle east". Terrorist always stand for something and it's not a simple 'fuck you'. They have a very good reason for wanting to end their lives in a violent explosion, and I care about what that reason is.
-	-	I love the double standard. Visa and MC can cut off money owed to Wikileaks and get away with it.  Somebody DDOS's their sites for a couple days and it's time to throw somebody in jail.
-	-	I'm not saying that its right (because I don't think it is) but couldn't one just make the argument that they are engaging in Real Politi? Isn't protecting a nation's citizens and interests the government's main, if not sole, reason for being? If that's true then what, if anything, should they consider beyond their own interests? These questions are really at the heart of almost every major issue facing the world at the moment. Governments act under the guise of aiding other people/nations etc when in actuality are acting in their own best interests. 
-	-	Just to clarify; I'm not American.
-	-	I am not clear on how I am wrong when the judgement on the lawsuit hasn't even been rendered yet.
-	-	Honestly, I'd just say that the US government doesn't give a shit about a lot of its own citizens... at least the ones that need help, that is. (Note how Congress's disapproval rate is 75%.) Don't get me wrong, I love the US, or at least the principles it stands up for, but most of them have been warped to suit the government.

1	6	It's called being an accessory after the fact or in other cases, aiding and abetting:  &gt;United States Code (U.S.C.), section two of title 18:(a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal. (b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.  One could make a strong argument that (a) applies here.  That by accepting this data and furthering the dissemination via their website, Wikileaks  aided Manning.  Under Federal Law, that is enough to mean that they could be tried for the exact same crimes as Manning.  Also, there are reports that several of the leaked cables resulted in some deaths.  Don't be surprised when a zealous prosecutor tosses in some felony murder rule charges as well.  That's all assuming that Manning acted independently and sent the info to Wikileaks.  That would all change if there is enough evidence to point to an agency relationship.  As for it being unconstitutional, you are mistaken.  The Pentagon Papers cases stood for the proposition that you could not have a prior restraint on publication, but you most certainly can prosecute after the fact.  
-	-	How is it ridculous?  Government pressure = letters and phone calls from the government saying that if you do not stop XYZ, you will be in violation of the patriot act, subject to investigations, on the no-fly list, risk of assets seized, etc.  If that doesn't work, they simply get a court order,  Non-compliance with the court order = charges under the Patriot act, investigations, on the no fly list, assets seized, etc.    In the end, the result is the same.  That's why I said there's no difference between the two.  
1	6	I will be surprised if Visa or MC claim "greater good"   But dominant market position?  If there were more payments methods the governments concerned would just pressure them too.
-	-	If I recall correctly that case was about prior restraint, not whether additional legal action could be taken after.
0	2	Much ado about nothing  what I got from your post was, Wikileaks = cool, eurpoe =/= wikileaks  stupid point to chose to make but whatever... continue thinking you're smart...
-	-	&gt; a request for prosecution will be filed with the EU Commission.  The EU Competition Commission would prosecute, but it wouldn't be a lawsuit?
-	-	The problem is that in order for those small individual actions to amount to anything we'll need to change our culture to make failing to boycott socially unacceptable.
1	4	I get your perspective a lot, and I guess it's just in my overall negativity about the power of people against the face of dominant corporate interest.  It's a daunting enemy.  However, I do think that you should check out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpAMbpQ8J7g  It's a good look at why charity, in fact, is not necessarily good.  Especially the forced charity that comes with the capitalist CSR process.
-	-	Please read my last sentence. It is "okay" in the legal sense, which was all I was commenting on. 
-	-	It's not a technicality, you just don't understand what the Constitution means.
-	-	It is avoided if the edit is done within two minutes of posting.
-	-	But there aren't and the issue at hand is the specific actions of the existing quasi-monopolies within the EU.  Teller has already admitted that they terminated the contract with Datacell because they were told to. If they refused to comply they might as well have shut up shop there and then; that's an effect of Visa/MC's quasi-monopoly on payment processing within the EU.  It doesn't matter if the instruction can be traced all the way back to a 'Post-It' note on Hillary Clinton's fridge door; the fact remains that it's within the remit of DG-IV to investigate the complaint.
-	-	The court ruled that the NY Times could not be legally stopped from publishing classified documents. If it's "clear cut" that it "violates U.S. law to distribute classified data" then are you really going to tell me the court would have ruled that you cannot stop a source from publishing it?
-	-	None of those legally apply to Wikileaks. No aiding, abetting, counseling, commanding, or inducing of the crime was committed.
-	-	Big Battery has always been on the side of the people.
-	-	Not happening.
0	1	shut the fuck up you spoiled brat
-	-	I'd rather ask how a post as on-point and as well-thought as this gathered so many downvotes. I already know the answer though : people downvote this because they disagree with it.  I don't agree with this post, but I upvoted, because this is the starting point of a debate that needs to be had - when the USA occasionnally act against the interests of the world population (producing negative externalities), do the citizens need to be held accountable?
-	-	With an American judicial system as corrupt as our current one, I respectfully laugh at your innocent hopes.
-	-	irrespective of how it ends, it is a worthy struggle.  Same with the flotilla. They all know it will not end well, but they are going again.
1	6	What American companies? No American companies are involved here. They're suing Visa Europe and MasterCard Europe, not Visa and MasterCard. Separate, independent European companies.
-	-	Mastercard Europe and Euro Visa are not American companies. They are European companies. American law is irrelevant.
1	6	Why would you spend money to buy music from a website that has no affiliation with the artists making the music? They may be legal under Russian law, but they certainly aren't paying the bands any meaningful royalties.  If the money you are spending doesn't go to the people who made the music, why bother? You can download a better version of the album off of bittorent for free.
-	-	You don't have to. Let the European judges the be, well, judges of that.
-	-	Same people?
-	-	How do you get the money to them? 
-	-	If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever.
1	4	I often feel this way, however this is exactly what they would like you to believe. Why fight if you can never achieve any real change? You have to fight even when you think it's hopeless, change is possible but only if enough people believe it's possible. 
-	-	To be fair, oppression in the West now vs. 100 years ago is quite different. I don't think it's fair to say we'll surely never break out of it.
-	-	This is the tale of a man who breaks through the endless cycle of violence...
-	-	FREE MARKET
-	-	Again, I have the opinion that they are indeed doing something wrong, and so did Visa/Mastercard.   I think the declassification of my governments documents shouldn't be left to some foreigner who has an agenda against me.
-	-	If it was just the companies it might be ok: unfortunately they were acting due to pressure from the government.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11945875  "PayPal has said that its decision to stop people from using its service to make donations to Wikileaks was made after a letter from the US government."  this isn't about the freedom of companies. it's also about government pressure and influence being used to try to snuff out a news/activisit organisation.
-	-	&gt; As much as I support Wikileaks, come on guys/gals, the company has the right to choose not to provide service to them.  [In a free market, yes, but the EU has no such thing.](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Eu_competition_law)
-	-	so a company can chose to be racist or bigoted?   Would it  be okay to deny someone service because you have an issue with their sexuality or their colour.   Would it  be okay to deny service because you object to the customers principles?   
0	3	You can then go and say that banks cannot refuse to provide financial services to terrorists and shit like that, what can you do when you can't stop them from getting money?  I personally think wikileaks and Julian are doing something wrong, so this might give you some insight into my thinking here.
-	-	No collusion between Visa and MC has been proven in any court, so it's all speculation. 
-	-	So by your rationale, Visa is required to allow donations to Al Qaeda until they are convicted in US court?  **ED:** Ah, too chickenshit to come up with an argument, so just going to downvote me. 
-	-	They have a reason.  The U.S. state department declared Wikileaks actions illegal.  Disagree all you want, but it is still a reason.
-	-	The US Government.  You know, the people who make and enforce the laws in the United States?
-	-	corporations are psychopaths 
-	-	So due to a language technicality, it's okay for the government to subvert the Constitution as long as they don't tell you about it?
0	2	What you are saying doesn't make any sense. I am talking specifically about corporations. I am not saying that a boycott of a company is always the correct solution, and I am not saying that a boycott should be the only solution, as other means are valuable as well.  But you are saying that because the difference that a small action makes isn't huge, that the action isn't worth doing.  You are putting words into my mouth by trying to suggest that I condone anyone doing whatever they want and simply letting popularity/profitability decide what is worthwhile. I am simply making a specific point about taking individual action about what I believe to be right.  The logic you are pushing could be used in the same way to condemn all donations to charity that don't completely solve every problem ever. "Oh, my donation doesn't make much of a difference, so I just shouldn't bother..."  In fact, the entirety of your second paragraph seems to be just a jumble of vaguely anti-corporate sentiments which you're trying to connect to the idea of not bothering to take an action because said action is not "world changing."  Ultimately, the point you seem to be trying to make is one of degrees. You suggest that a boycott is always a bad idea because it isn't enough. Okay...so do more. But you can still avoid buying a product or supporting a service based upon the actions of the company which offers it. I don't pretend that me refusing to use a credit card will take down the whole bank...I do it because it's my money, and I believe it should go to people who'll be responsible.  In short: I disagree with your accusation, but I can concede that there is always a need for more action. I just don't believe that the possibility of highly significant actions being necessary in order to affect change invalidates the impact and personal meaning or less significant actions...like an individual boycott of an irresponsible or immoral company.
-	-	I love Kroger. They actually seem to know what they're doing too...I always prefer the Deli at Kroger to Walmart.
-	-	The article is wrong. They are filing a complaint with the EU Competition Commission. Any legal action taken would be taken by the Commission since the complaint alleges violation of EU law.  
1	4	To be fair, I don't actually buy the product. I don't even have a sidewalk. I was just looking for an example of something I don't support/have faith in, and roundup was the first thing listed on Monsato's wikipedia page.  I'm not trying to have a debate, stop picking at my semantics. My overall point was that I've always considered Europe as having good ethics legally, so my faith in them continues. If the lawsuit goes through, it won't do anything to restore my faith in humanity as a whole.
-	-	People blame everyone else before themselves huh.
0	3	He was a terrorist because he purposely tried to strike fear.  He struck at people that the media said he didn't target yet so no one would feel safe.  This is terrorism.  Also, why the FUCK did you delete your other comment, you coward?  The one about how no one knew who bin Laden was before 9/11, despite engaging in other *very well known* terrorist attacks before then, and being placed on the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitives list in 1999?
0	1	&gt;'No one give's a fuck about **Obama** by the way... This all happened before anyone even knew who he was.' -me  &gt;'You are spectacularly ignorant. **Osama** bin Laden was put on the FBI's Most Wanted list in 1999' -you  yea, sorry about that, I misread Osama for Obama, not that you cared or noticed either mr ignorant caller lol.. its even in your quote of me, its hilarious watching you get all tight in the crotch over a mistake which now both *YOU and I* have made... HA
-	-	not on the iphone app.
-	-	MUST. AVOID. ASTERISK. OF. SHAME.
-	-	&gt;Like hell, both are wholly owned subsidiaries of corporations headquartered in the US.  They operate in Europe. That means they are subject to European laws. 
1	6	What crime did Wikileaks commit? (or "contributed towards")
1	4	&gt;facilitaing a known enitity conducting espionage properly. gotta be a law frowning on it.  There is, but that isn't something that wikileaks has been accused of, nor is it something they have been charged with.  Indeed it doesn't seem like they broke any US law at all.
-	-	No, they're actually independent companies that license the brands from the US companies and have interoperability agreements with the US companies (and other licensees).
-	-	1.  Right, which laws?    I'm guessing from your posts that you've ignored the commentary and argument about the difficulty of finding any valid law to prosecute Wikileaks under.
-	-	Yeah, I know they can do what they want, but OP said that they could have gotten in trouble with the law if they didn't stop the funds. That's what I was asking about.
-	-	It's not illegal to publish classified data. [New York Times Co. v. United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._United_States). First amendment rights to Free Speech trump the government's need to protect secrecy. While obtaining the papers may have been illegal, publishing them certainly is not. 
-	-	&gt;The laws probably were distributing classified data and obstruction of justice.  You have to be convicted of "violating the law." WikiLeaks hasn't even been charged with anything, so it's pretty impossible for it to have been convicted.
-	-	&gt;Under the best case scenario, these companies can choose not to comply. The US government gets a court order forcing compliance under threat of prosecution, and we're right back where we started.  EXCEPT at this point there has been Judicial Review, which I would consider one of the minimum elements of Due Process.
-	-	&gt; These companies did act legally.  Not according to EU and Danish laws. You do business there, you follow their laws. Of course, this has to be confirmed in trial... "innocent until proven guilty".  EDIT:  &gt; Visa Europe is a separate membership entity that is an exclusive licensee of Visa Inc.'s trademarks and technology in the European region, issuing cards such as Visa Debit.  So, the company isn't even American, they don't have to follows US law at all.
1	4	Actually they were getting funded through charitable donations, dozens of which were shut down and their accounts frozen following 9/11. But let's leave that example off if you don't like it and go abstract. The same argument applies to Bernie Madoff or a money laundering ring.   Does Visa have the right to refuse to conduct transactions to an organization under investigation for major crimes during that investigation?  
-	-	Nice trolling. And I ask again, since you have proved incapable of answering. Is Visa, in your view, required to provide transactions for any entity accused of serious crimes until a conviction takes place or is an accusation and criminal investigation sufficient grounds for them to deny service in the interim?  **ED:** And just downvoting again. Alright, I'm done with you troll. 
-	-	At first I read that as "WikiLeaks and *Duracell*." I was so confused.
-	-	Except, in the EU, there are laws against payment providers acting this way..... this isn't the US we're talking about. 
-	-	Bradley Manning begs to differ.  The US will seek charges against Wikileaks when it can. But there is no point to doing it in absentia. 
-	-	There are numerous court orders that the US government can obtain under the Patriot act that are not subject to judicial review, or any review at all.    
-	-	False.  Visa Europe Ltd. is wholly owned by Visa International Service Association.  Mastercard is composed of the worldwide component (MasterCard Worldwide Inc.) and the local membership component. The local membership component is used to provide representation to Mastercard Worldwide (note the 14 banks represented on board) to member banks and is owned by those banks, they do not deal with transaction completion. As a result there would be no standing to take action against them in this matter as they neither made the ruling or enforced it.
-	-	See how far your ethics go when you're placed on a no-fly list, have your assets seized, are under federal investigation, have charges brought against you under the patriot act, and are having every aspect of your business and personal life being picked apart by government authorities.  See how many of your customers want to do business with a company that could have their assets (and therefore, customers' money) seized at any point in time.    That's what would happen to every single one of these companies if they decided to "take a stand", "stick it to the man", or make some kind of political statement by going against the wishes of the US government or the European Union.  Businesses have an ethical obligation to their shareholders, their board of directors, and their customers.  And getting out of the way while the US gov't, EU, and Wikileaks dukes it out is the most ethical thing they could do, given the choices available to them.  Personally, I would find that a business "taking a stand" in such a way as to put everything at risk to be highly unethical, especially when such business has no direct stake in the outcome.  
-	-	In practice, there is no difference between the two.  
1	4	Well since I don't know the competition rules of the EU, I can't say whether or not they're breaking any laws or if it's a matter of two sides interpreting it in different ways.    Giant corporations like this have teams of lawyers on the payroll specifically to handle lawsuits such as this.  Visa Europe will have made enough money in the time it takes me to type this reply to more than adequately cover any legal fees they incur.    Even if they lose the case, I very seriously doubt these companies are quaking in their boots over the money they stand to lose. 
-	-	Really?  Because I'm pretty sure the law is on their side.
0	1	&gt;Taking a building or two down with an airplane is not how terrorism works. Terrorist always have a point to what they do, and very rarely that point is simply 'fuck you'.   You really don't know what you're talking about.  There are many terrorist and plotted terrorist attacks that aimed simply at destroying lives, often through attacking symbolic places.  The ultimate goal was to get rid of American influence in the middle east, especially our support of Israel, through striking fear.  This is also why they attacked the WTC in 93.  This is why rogues like the beltway snipers shot random people around DC.  To strike fear.  Not because of a "fuck you".  Osama was already a target.  Remember USS Cole? 
-	-	Osama had said for a long time he wanted to strike at major sources of US power and prestige. Read some more before posting.
-	-	chemtrail theorists and birthers.  
-	-	Everyone who fought in the Iraq war IS a war criminal. It's an immoral and illegal war. That's why I upvoted it. Deal with it.
-	-	&gt;The courts are the legislative branch of the government.  No, no they're not.
-	-	Ugh, I didn't want to have to make this comment explaining myself, but as often happens to me on reddit, I can't help it.  Read it again.  I use the herbicide Roundup to kill the grass growing through the cracks on the sidewalk, and it works well. My faith in Monsato, however, remains unchanged.  Or look at it this way: My faith in europe remains unchanged. My faith in humanity remains unchanged.
-	-	You will come to regret this decision.
1	4	Regardless of how secret the info was, I feel like forcing an American company to support wikileaks is like forcing a homeowner to let a dog come in your house and take a pee on your walls. Not that everything wikileaks has done has been wrong and hurtful to America, but I don't think its wrong to deny support.  
-	-	I don't know EU law, but certainly the wikileaks lawyer won't go into court with 'well i'm not entirely sure about the law.' 
-	-	It's not a lawsuit.
-	-	YAY!!! While they're at it, they should go after Paypal too!
-	-	If this goes through, some of my faith in humanity will be restored.
-	-	that we know of
-	-	Do you really believe that?  That telling American companies not to help a foreign company that is revealing classified info is the worst thing we've done?  
-	-	&gt;his was the creepiest, most disturbing thing the American government has done in the past 10 years.  War on Iraq, war in Afghanistan?
-	-	They wont win. Legal system's bought and paid for by big businrss. 
-	-	...that you know of.
-	-	Visa and Mastercard have no obligation to protect free speech.
0	1	&gt;This was the creepiest, most disturbing thing the American government has done in the past 10 years.  Hahahahahahahahhahaha.  &lt;Breath&gt;  Hahahhhaaahahahhah.  Are you fucking kidding me? Financially choking a white collar whistleblowing organization? That's the worst?  It's not the waterboarding? Not the inhumane and sickening torture of Muslims in Guantanamo? It wasn't our illegal invasion and our destruction over over a hundred thousands lives in the Middle East? It wasn't the extraordinary assassination of Bin Ladin in another country without any trial or even proof of his death.   It's shocking. A month or two ago, the US Government sent Navy Seals into a target half a mile from Pakistan's premiere military school, in a city full of military lifers and retirees, and assassinated someone. Without warning the Pakistani government, or even letting them know.   Do you feel safe? Safe knowing that the United States can enter a country and assassinate people with troops on the ground, and no one bats an eyelash?   And you're telling me this is the most disturbing.  _Wake up_. 
-	-	Ah...I would have thought the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan would rank pretty high up there.
-	-	They are aloud to stifle your "free speech".  You are only guaranteed that the government won't restrict your speech.
-	-	Indeed.  The fact that the U.S government can financially suffocate any one organization at the push of a button (and outside of any legal process) should be a chilling wake up call to just about anyone. They are the actions of a rogue state.
-	-	As has been stated, there has been nothing proven that wikileaks has done anything illegal, or are you taking a guilty until proven innocent stance?
-	-	The companies didn't boycott countries...
-	-	I don't think it's right either. It's more of a neutral thing.
-	-	Freedom of speech 'damages' America? Isn't this one of the principals America was founded on?
-	-	They're suing. That means they gain money if they win.
-	-	He can't.  Helping him in any way would be seen as admission that Manning was the leak which has yet to be proven.  Assange is also not a US citizen and Manning is in the US Military court system, sort of, at the moment.  Other than protesting you have no power to help Manning either unless you plan on storming Quantico.
-	-	that's an interesting oxymoron.  no-one "damages" america more than american companies.
-	-	Is it legal to use this site within the US?
-	-	No they don't, try reading the actual article before displaying your stupid to the world.
0	1	If you don't give a 'fuck' don't post about not giving a 'fuck'; it ruins your argument.
-	-	Nike? or Prada? 
-	-	Either the downvotes confirm the idea that, "people downvote this because they disagree with it." or people don't think we should be discussing "when the USA occasionnally act against the interests of the world population".   Time to remove r/worldnews from my frontpage. 
-	-	The songs were actually a bit cheaper when I used the website (2003) it was 1 cent per megabyte of data downloaded.  Thus if a song was 5.6mb, it would be 5.6 cents, rounded to the nearest cent at checkout.
0	1	What the fuck?!  That is fucked up.
-	-	Yep.  I never created an account with mp3sparks, but my balance, account settings, and music history came right over from allofmp3.
-	-	[These people](http://www.allpay-ez.com/) have the codes you need to fund your account.  They charge a 10% premium, but AllofMp3 gives you a 10% bonus if you use them, so it's a wash.  They usually have a lot more codes than they do at present, but I'm sure they will get more soon.
-	-	&gt; they certainly aren't paying the bands any meaningful royalties.  Neither is the RIAA or any major distributors of music in the western world.  So you're saying to go for the torrents then.
1	4	Considering they offer many lossless formats, you can't really get "better" quality with torrents.  Anyway, I purchase from them because my time is worth something to me.  Downloading through their iTunes-like interface is very easy and intuitive, and all the tracks are named just how I want them, put in the exact directory structure I want, and include all the correct metadata without "RIPp3D by H@xer" in the comments field.  Torrents have their place, especially for full discographies, but for one-off tracks, allofmp3 is awesome.
-	-	I don't think anyone has been sued under it, but I'm sure they could sue you under the DMCA or something. *shrugs*
1	4	If we ever break out of it, it will only be because we used against them the one thing they can't bend at a whim: fact. Of course, that requires a free trade of information, which at this point is the Internet. Hence, everybody trying to restrict/pass laws on the internet. I could even see ISP's being in on this (though I doubt it), with things like bandwidth caps and ridiculous prices.
0	3	Actually it would be illegal because it has been declared a terrorist organisation by US, UK, Europe and UN. Wikileak so far hasn't so they are not an illegal entity. Unless US can prove that they are not covered under journalism laws they cant call them illegal and if they do then they might as well lock all free press in jail.
-	-	Assuming legality,they probably would, the bunch of greedy bastards.  Didn't Citibank get indicted for brazenly laundering Mexican cartel money?  I'm sure numerous finance fiends would love to manage the Saudi royal checking account.
1	4	Although I disagree with your comparison I have upvoted you for making a good point. Being no legal expert, I don't think Wikileaks has broken any laws. They are publishing information submitted to them.  It's like comparing a shoplifter to a serial bomber. Sure, they are both criminals but there is a huge difference between them.
0	3	Good parallel, but Al Qaeda doesn't get funded through donations or MC/Visa payments, I assure you.  EDIT: And since you're so hot for an argument: Al Qaeda is a "terrorist" network influencing religious ideologies with direct violence for years upon years, WikiLeaks is not doing that despite what Fox news tells you.
1	4	Not me downvoting you. More likely it is people who can't be bothered refuting such specious logic. If you had paid attention, I wasn't commenting on the right or wrong of Visa's actions, but the legal status of Wikileaks' actions. 
-	-	Yes, it's speculation, so Wikileaks+Datacell are going to court to sort out.  Which is a bit of a contrast to all the illegal talk regarding Wikileaks, since so far not one charge has been laid upon them, and not one suit brought to them.
1	4	From the article (which, given your comments, you probably didn't read):  &gt; It was pointed out to these companies that their coordinated action on December 7th last year to block all credit card transactions to WikiLeaks and DataCell constituted a serious violation of the Competition Rules of the EU (Article 101(1) and 102). Furthermore, that the actions of these companies have violated Danish merchant laws when they terminated the payment services and by refused to reinstate them.  Pressure or no pressure, it seems like they are indeed breaking two laws.  As for "paying for it", I mean that they are facing legal action. That is expensive in it self, and I imagine if they lose, they will have to pay much more. I can't vouch for this, but someone in this thread has stated that Visa has denied them over 15 million dollars. 
-	-	Nope, using the standard one.
-	-	Legal and ethical are not the same thing, don't confuse the two.
-	-	Was it government orders, or government pressure?
1	4	I undownvoted you, because rational arguments should be debated (even if just refuted), not downvoted.  The thing is, the state department have constantly been repeating that wikileaks is "breaking the law"; but that's a lie, or -at best- yet to be determined. In fact, the New York Times did exactly the same thing during the Watergate scandal, and that was legal at the time. (If you might recall, in that standoff, ultimately Nixon was forced to resign)  At the same time wikileaks keeps finding new information on how the US government has been breaking the law, *and proving it*. So you can see why the state department has a good motive for trying to discredit wikileaks and get them shut down.
-	-	Perhaps because you didn't read it? You said Visa/Mastercard have the right to chose who they do business with. I pointed out that if you read the article you would see they do not if fact have this right if they want to trade in Europe. I was not commenting on the suit but the rights of corporations trading in Europe.
-	-	They worked for the Washington Post. The other two papers involved were Time and ... NYT. (I mentioned NYT specifically, because they've also collaborated with Wikileaks)
-	-	&gt; Well, for them to risk "civil and criminal penalties under US law" Wikileaks would have to have done something illegal. AFAIK, nobody has demonstrated that they have. No charges have been filed against Wikileaks. The US government has shown nothing to indicate that they have anything to charge them with.  They wouldn't need to do anything of the sort. They would simply need to show that a crime had been committed and the organization(s) contributed towards the commission of the crime. A crime was committed without dispute, wikileaks culpability is what is in dispute, also as wikileaks is not a US based corporation they can't be pursued civilly and probably not criminally either in the US.  Visa &amp; Mastercard were both enabling the continuation of that crime and so could not be held liable, even if the government could not make a criminal case they almost certainly would be able to make a civil one, civil is balance of probabilities not beyond all reasonable doubt. Simply making a showing they were notified of the crime and that it was continuing would be sufficient.
-	-	&gt; Visa Europe and MasterCard Europe are independent companies  Like hell, both are wholly owned subsidiaries of corporations headquartered in the US. The US government can and have asserted the standing to take action against US based corporations for their international operations. Also based on how merchant services function the processing is with the bank originating the payment card, someone paying an EU merchant from the US would still involve a financial transaction in the US.
-	-	You appear to have your own definition of "legally".
0	3	These companies did act legally.  They were under government orders to cease doing any business with Wikileaks.  Not doing so would likely have put these companies in violation of the PATRIOT act, would have led to various board members/CEOs being brought under investigation and being put on the no-fly list for "sponsoring terrorism", and god knows what other investigations into their day-to-day operations.    They are within their moral rights to take no action, whether or not they support a particular cause.  Just because you do or don't believe in something personally does not mean you're obligated to actively support that cause, especially when doing so puts your personal freedoms, career, and company at risk.    &gt;Personally I think that these company's do have to be held to account, now, by anyone who can do that so that next time they do act ethically, morally and legally..  And what person, company, or governing entity has the power to overrule the US government?  The US government is the one making these demands that these companies do not do business with Wikileaks.  There is nothing that you, I, or any company, government, or organization on this planet can say or do that can trump the actions the US government can take if they choose not to comply.  Nothing.  Under the *best* case scenario, these companies can choose not to comply.  The US government gets a court order forcing compliance under threat of prosecution, and we're right back where we started.    From there, you just tack on charges under the PATRIOT act, arrest, prosecution, government seizures of assets, jail time, etc. etc. etc.    There is no way for them to do what you want them to do without running head-to-head with the US government.  If you want to do that from the comfort an anonymity of the other side of your computer screen, you go right ahead and do that.  But there is no company in this country that wants to remain out of jail and in business that is willing to do so.  And I don't blame them one bit.  It's a no-win battle.     
-	-	The difference is that the KKK isn't the target of a government sanctioned witch-hunt.  The KKK also has the luxury of a SCOTUS ruling saying that while their words and actions are deplorable, they're perfectly legal.    Wikileaks has no such luxuries.  
1	4	The problem is that they're under similar pressure from the European Union, who stands to be just as embarrassed by Wikileaks as the US government.    Now I don't know how much power the EU holds, or if they have the capability to do the things the US government can do to american-based companies like Amazon and Paypal.  But I'm sure that the EU is putting as much pressure as they can on Visa Europe as they possibly can.    People keep saying they are breaking the law -- they are *not* breaking the law.  Refusing to do business with a person or company that could negatively impact their business (even through no fault of their own) is not unlawful.  Continuing to do business, however, with a person or company that the US government (or European Union, respectively) is telling you not to do business with IS both unlawful and unethical.  As for "paying for it"....I'm willing to bet that not doing business with Wikileaks has not affected their bottom line one bit.  
-	-	If they were in violation of any law, then every whistleblower in US history is in violation of the same law.  Manning broke the law by stealing the documents in the first place, but Wikileaks is not in violation of any law for releasing them.  
-	-	See how long you stand up when the US Government has both barrels pointed at you and everything is on the line.  It's much easier to stand up for your principles when you're hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and have nothing to lose. 
-	-	Visa is a US based company and so they abide by US law first  [The US did attempt to lay criminal charges](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/11/29/holder-says-wikileaks-criminal-investigation/)
-	-	Yeah releasing secret documents is not against the law. It really isn't. They are a completely legal entity.
-	-	You are absolutely correct and if Visa/Mastercard feel this way then they are entirely entitled to not do business in Europe. However if they want to do business in Europe they will need to follow EU laws.
0	3	As I've said in another comment, in Visa's case, they are suing Visa Europe, a separate European entity, with no ties to the US with the exception that they are the sole licensees of Visa's service in Europe. They have absolutely no reason to fear the mighty PATRIOT Act.  So, do I understand them? Yes, of course, they are protecting their interests and playing nice with the US government, which is very powerful. Does that excuse them? No, not a little. They have a duty to follow the law (and act ethically). For breaking that, they are paying for it.
-	-	They are buying a licensed physical copy of a recording.  
1	4	2.34% on some mechanical and that's after a very generous advance, and 50% on licenses, and depending on if they were the writer a writer's percentage on licenses.  Look I do this for a living.  If people actually bought music it would be perfectly fine.  The fact that people say.. "I pirate because I am sticking it to the labels" is like saying I am going to stick it to the loggers by throwing away paper.     Now I'm not saying the labels give artists the best deals (but depending on who your management and rep is you can get a pretty lucrative one) but sticking with the throwing away paper analogy the   loggers (labels) hurt forests (artists)  You throwing away paper (piracy) just makes them hurt trees (artists).  more.  You don't realize it but I see it everyday, and don't tell me otherwise. Like I said I actually WORK in this business.  
-	-	They could just pay Wikileaks with 2-3 MP3s....
-	-	Compounded daily.
0	1	Who gives a fuck, people reading wikileaks are probably a majority of white, arm chair commando, from assorted European countries or from the US wanting to bitch about the US.  If your bitching about the manning kid, it's his punishment for not doing a fucking job.  We all get paid to do a job right?  Obviously it makes sense to NOT punish someone for breaking the rules and doing their job incorrectly, that they signed a contract to do.  I mean obviously wiki-leaks is MEGA important because a whole bunch of white pasties out there want to watch videos of war and death and destruction and shit, because their X-box didn't give them enough.  The worlds full of terrible shit, maybe it's time for people start focusing on some good shit.  get over yourselves. 
-	-	Visa and MC are corporations and have every right to deny service to any organization or person at any time. Some of you boneheads need to move out of mom's house and start educating yourselves. You will fail big time with these silly ideas you seem to have about how the world works.
-	-	I don't think its wrong for an american company to deny support to an organization that does damage to america. 
1	4	It may end good, it may end bad, but it will be better than reality tv!
0	2	EU laws are shit. As much I dislike MC and Visa for doing this, it is THEIR RIGHT to deny ANYONE business.

-	-	That does not make sense. I don't want Wikileaks to waste the money that was donated to them by going up in court against credit card companies that have more money than many small countries.
1	6	What they dont tell you is that datacell said it would ddos mastercards servers and make this huge publicity stink if mastercard continued to not allow payments to wikileaks.
0	1	Good, make those motherfuckers pay through the nose for colluding with the government against the people.

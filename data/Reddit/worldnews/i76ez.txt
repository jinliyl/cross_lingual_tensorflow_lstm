-	-	Since the afghan war started, opium production in the country has more than doubled. Russia and China are facing a heroin epidemic right now and the US military is protecting the opium fields. 
0	1	Heh, fuck that shit.  Let China protect their own border.  
-	-	wish they'd get into mdma, we're really short of that at the mo..
1	6	The North Korean government should manufacture heroin for its people. 1. It would allow them to mask their problems. "Look at this magical medicine our dear leader has created! 2. It would make the populous complacent. "Why not shoot up instead of argue?" And if they do argue, they can just pull their source. ENJOY YOUR WITHDRAWS, LOL  Hell, this dictator thing is easy. 
1	6	I'm surprised the North Koreans didn't think of this earlier. Why NOT become a Narco-state? The Pyongyang regime already runs the country like a giant slave labour camp, so why not operate at least one cash industry, regardless of the morality?
1	6	Seems smart.  The DPRK is rational.  A crazy, batshit, unscrupulous kind of rational.  But rational nonetheless.  
1	6	After reading this article and that one about Russian krokodil, I've come to a startling conclusion:  (to paraphrase Jurassic Park) *Because the history of evolution is that drugs escape all barriers. Drugs break free. Drugs expand to new territories. Painfully, perhaps even dangerously. But drugs find a way.*

-	-	Also I believe the majority of meth in Japan is supplied by the North Koreans.
1	6	&gt; Twenty years ago, Yanji had only 44 registered drug addicts. Last year, the city registered almost 2,100 drug addicts  odd - I was under the impression that using/abusing drugs in China was a mandatory death sentence...  have they relaxed their rules?
-	-	Everyone in r/politics should move to North Korea. There's no rich people (except in the government ranks), no capitalism, no right wing pundits, no christians... it's a left wing paradise. 
1	6	Meth is pretty hardcore. You have to be rather serious about your drug use to do something that can be cooked in a tub...Man, why does this Meth taste like soap?
-	-	And point hundreds of missiles at Seoul so there won't be international intervention.

1	4	I'm here with Blorktronics.   North Korea is starving... again. This time China doesn't want to send aid. Besides the fact that former aid was mismanaged, loans weren't payed back and Kim Jong-il is sending insane threats. Good reason may be support of DPRK for organized crime in China.  You wont hear about this on Reddit, but AFAIK much more repression in the country is aimed at crime syndicates than human rights activist.  IMO, in the long run China may prefer more American military near its land border. Look at Afghanistan. China is much better off with semi-failed state right now and American presence than with civil war 1994-2001 and total chaos.
1	6	Because it would royally piss off China, North Korea's last remaining 'ally' and supplier of vital resources such as oil. It would not be a wise move.
-	-	I'm assuming it's because most exportable drugs require some foreign inputs, like coca plants or opium plants. North Korea is in no condition to import anything, with sanctions, embargoes and being broke.
-	-	There have been rumors for years that they have in fact been doing that, mostly large-scale cannabis farming for export to Japan by small boats.
-	-	That krokodil article was scarey.
0	3	...That is strangely and frighteningly appropriate.
1	8	Trafficking is a death sentence for sure.  That's what got that Australian man sentenced to death a year or two back.  Not sure about using though, but that may depend on how much of the drug they had on them when they were caught.
0	5	Drugs are nothing but what human nature makes them. So you'd be more correct in saying *human nature finds a way.*

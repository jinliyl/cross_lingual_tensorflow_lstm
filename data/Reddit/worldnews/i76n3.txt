-	-	Syria hasn't killed any Turks as of yet.
0	5	Considering how much grief Turkey gave to Israel for that flotilla bullshit, I think Turkey is being pussies when confronted with real guns on their border.  It was OK for Turkey to condemn Israel for "atrocities" committed by Israel, but when it is happening in front of their very eyes on their border, they are wussing out.  Just saying it is no big surprise to see the Turks live with what seems to be a genocide happening right in front of their eyes and do nothing.  They have a past...
1	6	Agreed, also still waiting for US and European to bomb the Syria. Why hasn't this happened yet?

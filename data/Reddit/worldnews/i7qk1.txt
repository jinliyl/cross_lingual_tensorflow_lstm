0	2	Some men just want to see the doggy's urn.
1	4	Don't get on this sinking ship. Its a joke so bad not even birthday sympathy can right it.
	Unsubscribe complete. lolz
1	4	lol....
-	-	True. **THIS IS THE WORST** incident I have ever read about. It makes the atrocities committed in Afghanistan, Iraq and the African civil wars look like a picnic. This is the incident that surely heralds the end of humanity and civilization as we know it.    It is SURELY time for us to run around in a blind panic, crack each others heads open and feast on the goo inside while we wait for the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse.
1	8	I'm not serious all of the time, and I have a very dark sense of humor, but I just can't imagine anyone finding this funny.
1	4	Perhaps it is my long exposure to anime that allows me to visualize such events in an amusing way.  I have long ago noticed that some events portrayed in some of my favourite anime would be not at all funny if it were written or portrayed via actors.  Or, perhaps it is simply my perspective and the fact that I am not making the effort to empathize or construct anything but the vaguest of visualizations.  I mentioned jokingly replacing this event with my wife and my cat.  I found it funny because it is not within the realm of the possible, and the visualization does not capture the horror such an event would have if carried out in front of me.  Those who are amused alongside myself are probably not making the effort to see beyond the initial absurdity.  I have gone through enough personal trauma recently (friend had a miscarriage yesterday) to not wish to take on more emotional burden, thank you.  /pseudo-psychological babble.

0	2	Oh yes, that's it. Shit that happens is totally justified just because shit happens. We shouldn't be upset by it, just because shit happens and you should be used to it. Nothing will ever change, move  on, shit happens... blahblah.    Get the point: in my view - my very own which I do not care if anyone else shares or adopts - treating animals like shit, without reason, is evidence of such cruelty that it shreds the offender of their basic humanity. The same with children. How dare you take the life of or otherwise abuse something totally innocent? Just because you are fundamentally flawed, without compassion or conscience... like a beast who knows not any better.  You attempt to spin this as if I care nothing about human suffering in the world. It's not that. It's just that it isn't the topic I'm on. Human interaction on societal levels is wildly more complexed than one person - a cruel, angry beast - killing a 4 pound domestic dog for no fucking reason other than his flawed, feeble mind.    
-	-	&gt;and I have a very dark sense of humor  We'll be the judge of *that*!
1	4	Appreciate the intelligent response, thanks
0	2	&gt;How dare you take the life of or otherwise abuse something totally innocent?   I don't believe I did.   &gt;Just because you are fundamentally flawed, without compassion or conscience... like a beast who knows not any better.   Drama much?   &gt;You attempt to spin this as if I care nothing about human suffering in the world.   Incorrect. I am calling you an emotionally brittle fucktard for getting so upset about a news story. There are far worse stories out there. You should probably avoid reading them.
1	6	How interesting that you have measured how "upset" I am on my behalf. I was speaking my opinion. You started started bitching at me, and now I'm fucking saying what I feel like right back.   I don't need to grow a pair. I'm not fucking whining. I say what I feel when I feel it. I feel like this guy deserves to be strung up, and I feel like you are a fucking prick for trying to tell me how I should think or feel. I'm not into drama, but I don't let people put words or feelings out there for me, just so they can feel self important on the internet. Go gripe at someone else, perhaps someone who actually gives a shit what your unsolicited opinion is.
1	6	&gt;How interesting that you have measured how "upset" I am on my behalf.  http://www.abcteach.com/directory/reading_comprehension/   &gt;I feel like this guy deserves to be strung up  Fair enough.   &gt;I'm not into drama  In your original comment you said you were disgusted by humanity, like every single human being was guilty of this crime. That seems a bit dramatic to me.   &gt;Go gripe at someone else, perhaps someone who actually gives a shit what your unsolicited opinion is.  Unsolicited opinion? lol, welcome to reddit comments.  
0	1	Oh, I'm still disgusted by many aspects of humanity. Let me clarify that for you, since your willingness to be literal has affected your reading comprehension. (Thanks for the link, btw. I'm sure someone will find it useful.) Google this: hyperbole.  I see what you're trying to do there, but there's a baseless assumption that I must be upset to think he should be hung out to dry. I could give a fuck less about this individual, he's just one more who deserves it.  I guess this part could be effectively segued into a treatise on the flawed human condition, but the fact is, I posted a quick message saying this isn't funny to point out how fucked up it is. You came along and made a big fucking deal, trying to correct my train of thought for no reason.  I've been a little listless lately, so in some trollish way I have enjoyed bitching at you for bitching at me. Unfortunately, I'm tired of it now. Not because you have "won" though, so don't get it twisted. We have reached an impasse, and it's too trivial to go on.
0	2	Humanity deserves the shit that runs rampant through it because of our flaws thanks to free will.  Animals are innocent. Wholly innocent.   Mock all you want, but people who fuck with animals are the lowest of the low to me. I do not care if you agree or not.
1	6	Well, if you would have seen this woman, you'd have seen that not only were her tits great, but she had a Great Pyrenees.
1	6	Why... why am I laughing?
0	2	Beating your wife with a dog isnt normal   But on meth it is   Meth. Not even once
1	4	This guy is my new favorite hero.
0	2	It's a dog beat dog world out there...
1	6	LIKE A BOSS!
-	-	I often wondered what use there was for poodles. Now I know.
0	1	I guess she got... *puts on glasses* bitch slapped. 
-	-	-8? Not the best reddit birthday. Have an upvote!
1	4	well I thought it was funny
1	6	would you use a dog to beat your wife? no, a brick.  that guy just made literature come to life and proof the differ.
-	-	This man.
0	2	You mean "Tried to kill two bitches with one bitch".
-	-	Looks like she had a ruff night.
0	2	Beat the shih tzu out of them. Left that bitch in a poodle of blood.
0	1	I agree. There is nothing funny about this at all. It's fucking disgusting.
0	3	[He mad.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lm3h3mUOMl1qzozj1.jpg)
0	0	This belongs in the wtf reddit
0	1	What. The. Fuck.
1	4	I love my dog, but this headline made me chuckle for some reason.
0	2	This is probably the most hardcore possible way to call your wife a bitch - by smacking her with one.
0	2	I hope there wasn't a poodle of blood afterwards..
0	1	Fuck everyone in this thread that it's laughing at some dumbshit motherfucker who killed an inocent animal.
-	-	Dang 
0	3	Miniature poodle. A full sized poodle would have messed up the wife a hell of a lot more.
0	1	hahaha  taht caught me off guard  **LUL**z have been had  and it was a fucking poodle nonetheless, no one cares about those annyoing fucks
1	8	Man, why would you start hitting your poor dog with that thing you call your wife :&lt;
-	-	And wouldn't have weighed only four pounds.
-	-	Aida used something a bit bigger... anatolian shepherd would've left her cursinu.
0	1	Seriously, what the fuck is going on here?
1	8	&gt;Animals are innocent. Wholly innocent.  As opposed to who? The africans that get shot or hacked to death with machetes because they live in the wrong village? The people who get blown up by terrorists because they don't believe in allah? The store clerk who gets his head blown off because some crack head wants to steal $20? The thousands of people who die every day because they have no food?   This shit goes on ALL, THE, FUCKING, TIME. Life doesn't owe you or anyone else a cookie. Being innocent is no safeguard against batshit insane cruelty. Grow a pair man. It sucks that the dog was abused like that but move on.
-	-	This should be in r/wtf
-	-	Mortal Kombat!
0	1	hahaha  taht caught me off guard  **LUL**z have been had  and it was a fucking poodle nonetheless, no one cares about those annyoing fucks
0	1	Fucking scab.  When it comes time, I hope this man's death is excruciatingly slow and painful.  I didn't think it was possible for me to be more disgusted by humanity than I was previously, but it is. Fuck him, everyone like him, and everyone who finds humor in this. 
01	Fuck these humorous comments. Unsubscribe from worldnews and go to /r/wtf or /r/funny....
-	-	LIKE A BOSS!
1	7	The "quick mental picture" of an animal being killed has no initial meaning to me beyond the trust-shattering suffering and subsequent death of an innocent, loyal pet. On what planet is the image of a dog dying funny before it is sad?
-	-	Was it actually a poodle, or did they just pick a picture of the dog most people would be perfectly sympathetic towards killing?
0	1	What the fuck? Who beats their wife with a dog?
-	-	Tried to kill two bitches with one stone.
-	-	Bitchslap
0	2	I could see how hitting her with a poodle would have left that bichon her ass.
1	4	This is the funniest story I've ever heard. And I love dogs! but still.... it's hilarious  Maybe I'm just really REALLY faded right now... that, and it's funny
1	8	Whether it is funny or disgusting depends on whether you allow yourself to empathize.  Those who read the title, form a quick mental picture (possibly substituted with their own pets and loved ones), and move on will find it funny.  Those who read the article and think beyond the initial mental picture will realize the horror the wife is going through and not find it funny.  That said, I am one of the former, and joked with my wife about beating her with our cat.  I am generally not interested in mundane stories, and am most certainly not going to read up on the domestic disputes of an unknown couple in Brazil.  I was, however, attracted by the absurdity of the situation described in the title.  I agree that this belongs in /r/wtf rather than /r/worldnews.
1	4	me too haha, it is completely morbid but how can you not laugh a bit.
-	-	ZZzing!!!!!
-	-	You Sir, are a literary genius.
-	-	I guess he wanted to give her....   *puts on glasses*   A poodle hat    YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
0	2	It's dark humor. The image of a person beating another with a something uncommonly used as a weapon like a dog can be funny to some because of its absurdity.   People need to stop being so serious all the time.
-	-	I totally did as well. It's because it is a very dark and cartoony image. I think if you manage to actually imagine a real man swinging a real dog and killing it you will be very sad. 
1	6	Have you ever been so mad you swung a poodle?
1	4	BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY
0	1	How the fuck can you laugh at it?  I don't see any humor in this at all...

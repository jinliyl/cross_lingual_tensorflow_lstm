-	-	That's the problem. People seem to believe that once they have gained some form of liberty, it can never be taken back.
-	-	France has very brutal riot police.
-	-	2012 can't come soon enough.
-	-	Only a few people care.  Of those who care enough to be interested, only a handful of those are opposed to censorship.  The rest **favor** censorship, they just prefer the censorship to go along the lines they prefer.  
-	-	You can still protest a company using your wallet but you need to bug a politician to change laws.
-	-	Damnit. I should facepalm, but i still hurt from the last time.
-	-	Surprise!!  Once it starts, it never stops.  Censorship evolves (rapidly) to total control.  Restraint and moderation are concepts difficult for humans to grasp, and impossible for governments. 
0	1	The fact that people aren't flipping the fuck out at this amazes me. 
-	-	I cannot stand to see this type of news. Censorship is just.so.pointless.
1	4	Wow.  I guess the internet *IS* dead.  Bravo, Prince.
-	-	Big enough to give you everything you want, big enough to take it all away.  Governed enough yet?
-	-	Once we give them the power to start censoring our internet, they will never stop. Next thing you know they'll be in control of everything and changing news headlines and articles to create their own version of history. George Orwell predicted this... and I refuse to live in a world where Sarah Palin's statements can be made to be correct!!!
-	-	most of the the french i've met were control freaks
-	-	Not when you can make a lot of money from it! I'm probably way off base, but I put getting rid of net neutrality on the same level as government censorship (in some ways mind you)   As in, instead of a government telling me what webpages I can visit, it's comcast. Only comcast gets to charge more money. 
-	-	Yeah... hopefully, 2012 will bring something better :\

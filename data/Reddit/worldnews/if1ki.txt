1	6	Why would someone that can afford a better car opt to get this car using this program? 
-	-	Using people's poor impulse control against them seems unethical to me.
1	4	I'm just saying we shouldn't look down on them for having so many kids.  It's not like people living in rural India even have an income that they can save.
-	-	at this rate of inflation? savings dont amount to anything. Just the food inflation in India is in double digits and has been there for a few years now.
-	-	A couple years ago I saw a Back to School sale at a maternity store.
-	-	How is this unethical? I see nothing non-consensual going on here. In fact, it's more ethical than what China is already doing.  Also, I'm fairly sure they're already trying to educate them on vasectomies, contraception, family planning, etc.
-	-	but, pics or it didnt happen
1	4	Unless you save for retirement.  Seriously, the only alternatives aren't "Live off your kids" or "Get the government to force everyone younger than you to support you". People used to put away their own money for their own retirement. It's still possible, and still a good idea.  That aside, the sterilization program doesn't mention wanting people to have no children. It mentions people having no *more* children. So I'm unclear on how your comment relates to mine. Have the number of kids you want, then *stop*, and maybe get a new TV while you're at it.
-	-	&gt;there's no harm in getting another free one.  Sell it off, go Party Crashing, smash it with a sledgehammer to work off stress. A free car is a free car, and not something to thumb your nose at. And it's reasonable to get sterilized at some point in your life, especially if you've already had the number of kids you want to have, so why not put yourself in to possibly win something while you're at it?
1	4	I *really* don't think most peoples impulses are so bad that they'll agree to getting surgery done on their junk without a modicum of thought, and those that do deserve to live with the consequences, as horrible as that sounds.   Plus, if everyone with bad impulses got themselves sterilized wouldn't this have the result of breeding better impulse control? It's almost like claiming your own Darwin award.
-	-	if education is there then is voluntary sterilization is unnecessary. you can see the trend that educated countries in the west have a decreasing then plateaued trend in population. and educational efforts needs to doubled if you want to see faster results(i.e. 25 years or so...etc)
-	-	When I travelled in India, I asked people I met across the various regions what they thought of India's explosive population growth. Most told me that the idea of limiting the number of children you have is completely unacceptable in the Hindu religion, and they believe that exporting people to other countries (as India becomes too packed to live in) will increase India's influence around the world. They simply don't see the population as a problem.
1	4	I similarly think it would be a good plan to make IUDs free to everyone, including teenagers. It would temporarily (5 years) sterilize people who don't want to be parents, and so who probably shouldn't be parents at that time. And it would be entirely non-coercive and lack obvious exploitation.
-	-	After reading the article and the comments. I feel this little stunts isn't going have any real effect on pop growth. There need to be real incentives. Like tax credits for having 2 or less child. 
1	4	&gt;While authorities claim they have not received any complaints about the campaign, family planning advocates from the non-profit Population Foundation of India are not enamored with the plan, telling AFP it amounted to "coercion by a different name".  Ugh. It's not coercive, there's no guaranteed pay-off, considering how few items are being raffled off and how many people they hope to enter in their raffle the incentive seems more symbolic than anything. But God forbid anyone feel there's an extra reason to get sterilized! Why, that's, that's....what's a good scary word....coercive!  This seems like an entirely reasonable, no-pressure way to encourage people to get sterilized now rather than later. If they keep up the raffles, they may manage an entirely voluntary increase in the rate at which people stop risking pregnancy. In pretty much every aspect, it's laudable. But it will mean fewer cuddly babies, so apparently it must be fought, with lies and misinformation if necessary. I'll say again: ugh.
-	-	So basically everyone who owns a Nano will now be instantly branded as a sterile pauper?
-	-	Good for India, controlling population growth is the only way out of poverty.
-	-	Reminds me of that episode of sliders where they go to a dimension where you could win a lottery ...get everything you wanted. But you'd be killed after awhile. (to stop overpopulation)
-	-	we should offer this to American high schoolers.
-	-	Sign me up! Oh wait... American. 
-	-	Public policymakers use a combination of strategies to address a public health or safety issue called the "5 E's":  * Engineering: Physical, technological solutions (e.g., roads, pipes, facilities, drugs, computers)  * Education: Disseminating information to guide public actions (e.g., counseling, pamphlets)  * Encouragement: Providing incentives to make some actions more attractive or less costly (e.g., tax credits, amnesty programs)  * Enforcement: Using police action to discourage unwanted behavior or actions (e.g., fines, tickets, arrest, imprisonment)  * Evaluation: Using data collection and research to make existing processes better or to identify more effective/efficient policy solutions.  It looks as if China is choosing "enforcement," while India is choosing "encouragement." Neither of the policy solutions they chose may be effective (or even ethical), but they picked what they thought was the best solution to what they defined as a public health problem (overpopulation).
-	-	It is, to an extent, you just didn't do anything stupid enough to have meaningfully lasting consequences.  If you're old enough to know what sterilization is and to understand its consequences, and you still go through with it, it's nobody's problem but yours.  My point still stands: Anyone truly willing to go through with this process only because they're enticed by the raffle have automatically declared themselves unfit for parentage by valuing a potential car as more worthwhile than their potential progeny.
0	1	If my future was determined by the stupid shit I did when I was young, I'd be fucked.
1	4	I actually find that disturbing. I have no problem with readily available contraceptives, but this is too permanent.  Plus, I like this line: &gt;"If there is electricity in every village, then people will watch TV till late at night and then fall asleep. They wonâ€™t get a chance to produce children," Mr Azad said at the time. "When there is no electricity, there is nothing else to do but produce babies.
1	4	this actualy seems like quite a good idea.
-	-	what the hell?! so educating the population on family planning and doing this ethically is out of the window.
-	-	Nothing new in India where 'voluntary' sterilization dates back to Indira Gandhi.  
-	-	That's pretty much the same attitude I heard growing up in the South. 
-	-	Could also give prizes for IUD use.
-	-	In China they also say that but they do see the population as a problem, just a problem they hope to solve by everyone else not having babies while they still can themselves.
-	-	i  have never heard that. but if it does say that in the hindu religion,ok. but then its not just hindus is it. islam explicitly states that. if not by scripture, then cultural values is to have as many kids as possible
0	2	Why the implication that only the poor would take advantage of financial incentives? Even if you already have whatever they're raffling off, there's no harm in getting another free one.
1	4	In countries like India, your children are your retirement plan. Unlike Western nations, there aren't many social welfare programs, so when you're too old to work, your kids take care of you.  If you don't have kids, you'll just die when you get too old to work.
-	-	True. The target demographic for this project are not the kind of people who can just 'save for retirement'. Many of these people are living day to day, barely keeping their head above water.  Educated people in India are already using birth control and having ~2 kids.
0	2	I'm not looking down on people in rural India who have no alternatives in ensuring their survival in old age. I'm looking down on "the non-profit Population Foundation of India", who seem to view people having fewer children as intrinsically bad, regardless of the situation or personal choice.  I guess I'm also looking down on the Octomom, and others like her, who try to make prodigious breeding out as some sort of virtue. Unrelated, I know, but I just really hate those people. Utterly irresponsible and destructive.
1	4	No, what I'm implying is that those people silly enough to gamble their fertility away are less likely to be the kind of people emotionally mature enough to provide a stable family atmosphere, so voluntary self-sterilization is a fitting end.
-	-	I don't know if such behavior is hereditary if that's what you're implying.
-	-	My point exactly, do we want those people reproducing if they can't even sustain a healthy environment for themselves?  It's not nice to say people shouldn't reproduce, but it's worse to bring an innocent life into a vicious existence.
1	6	They're raffling off **one car**. I doubt that'll change the perception of them so much that it'll be assumed that if you drive one, you're poor and ball-less.  Also, do you know how sterilization works? For ones done on males, all that's done is that the vans deferens (tubes connecting your balls to your urethra) are cut and closed off. You still have balls.  And in case you missed it:  &gt;...go Party Crashing, smash it with a sledgehammer to work off stress.  There are still uses for free things, even if they won't sell well and you can afford better ones. Why turn your nose up at them?
1	6	There are plenty of people that gamble away their life's savings, homes, families.  What makes you think their fertility would be any different?
-	-	The car is already known for being a low quality piece of crap. It's not selling to well because of that. I mean just look up history of sales and you'll see that people aren't exactly flocking over it as people thought it would. Now it not just be a piece of crap but a piece of crap that basically yell "I'M SO POOR I SOLD MY BALLS!".

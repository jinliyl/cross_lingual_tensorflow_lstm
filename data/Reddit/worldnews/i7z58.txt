0	1	Oh no, my precious karma points â€” I was gonna buy a new espresso machine with those, and now they're all gone. Shit. This is terrible. I'll never make another controversial post again, evaar!   Fuck all of youse! Cunts. Gimme back my karma points, or I'll rape a puppy! 
-	-	It is.  Just not the barbecues and beaches you're thinking of.
-	-	Why is 100 days important? I seem to remember Europe killed 6 million Jews plus a few Roma and homosexuals for good measure, and even good old USA thought killing 100,000 civilians in one shot was fine and dandy.
-	-	Well, I downvoted him for assuming that Reddit isn't a serious place for discussion. It actually is, once you step away from the main subreddits. Some good ones are r/TrueReddit and r/DepthHub.
-	-	You get an upvote from me. Idealistic Redditors don't seem to understand that you have to look at these things from the aggressors point of view in order to understand what happened. "Those who do not remember history are doomed to repeat it." It's easy to look at the Hutus as monsters, but they are human just like everyone else. People should remember that every culture had a period where they did barbaric things. I haven't seen you condone the violence in any of your statements, you are simply adding perspective. Given that this happened, at some point it was bound to happen and you are just telling us how it got to that point. This has been a very enlightening discussion up to this point. This demonstrates why it is now impossible to have an intelligent discussion on Reddit. Too many idealist looking at the world through rose colored glasses.
1	6	He asked why you shouldn't do it, not whether it had been done before.
1	8	So...when the Germans tried to starve the entire Netherlands, that doesn't qualify? Or enslaved a significant portion of the Polish population? All those people who were in the "targeted" groups were Europeans belonging to individual nations first and foremost.What happened on both sides is that people let this happen to *other people* because *it wasn't  happening to them.* No nation got involved in WWII out of a sense of justice or violated ethics. They got involved because of political and economic reasons. If you actually look at the historical documents of them time, you'll find that the moral justification bit only got invented after the war. 
-	-	Wideband, brah 8)
-	-	Yes. People are being massacred all the time, but it is far away from you and most likely doesn't affect you (directly).  People have reason to care, reason to say and think that it's awful, reason to maybe donate a bit to help. That's about it.
-	-	Read the books and articles of Alison Des Forges and Gourevitch, France participated actively by exporting weapons during the genocide, by blocking the UN from doing an investigation on the crash site of the Rwandese President's plane, by harbouring all the "genocide government" in their embassy while letting their staff finally be massacred and more than I am not going to develop now.
-	-	Wasn't it Belgium?
1	8	Unfortunately, in another part of the world, a horrible event like [Srebrenica massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre) happened shortly after. I'm skeptic whether a lot of people aware of it.
1	6	Of course you know why that is. This country is so cravenly PC, and terrified of being accused of racism, that unless a crime is perpetrated by a European, you CANNOT call attention to it.  If the same situation had been the Scots slaughtering the Welsh, the US would have been all over it and calling it genocide. BUT, since the monsters in this case were African...... crickets.
-	-	niggers gonna nig, no matter where they are on the globe
1	6	Because raiding pension plans, running pyramid scheme scams, and bilking millions of people out of millions of their hard-earned dollars isn't destructive.    Gosh, those rich white people.  Why can't everyone be more like them?  
-	-	No, I'm describing a series of events leading up to 1994.  The one you mention included.
1	6	Why not?  Let's say you're the member of a formerly enslaved group. You somehow gain your freedom. The oppressors come back and there is no ability to negotiate or compromise. Let's also say that every member of this group constitutes a current or future threat.  What do you do?
-	-	I'm fairly sure there is a racial distinction, if not, why were they separate groups in pre-colonial times as you concede in bullet point number two?  In my genocide class, we learned that Tutsis are light skinned and tall.
1	8	Yes, sadly unthinkable human rights tragedies are happening right now all over the world.  Well documented and well known.  That's why the news gets to me... So much coverage of sensationalized bs and "filler" news.    On the other hand I think if people were forced to watch the really important stuff 24/7 they couldn't handle how bad it really is- and would simply tune out.  
1	8	No genocide has happened since Rwanda. What you mention are not genocide, they are massacres. There was no intent in any of your examples of a willingness to destroy ALL members of the opposing side. That said, if it would start again somewhere in Africa, I am convinced the lack of reaction would be the same.   Don't forget, the Rwandese Genocide lasted only 100 days during which about 800'000 people were massacred (that's 8000 dead/day, 333/hour, 5.5/minute !!!).  But I agree with your second paragraph.
-	-	I'm not *advocating* what happened, I'm trying to find out the context.  It's all to easy, again, usually for middle-class white Americans, to start wailing, wringing their hands, and waxing indignant about some far-away massacre, occupation, or whatever.  The fact is, these sorts of things are usually more complicated (that does NOT mean justifiable) than they're made out to be.  Having the attitude that "OMG! A bunch of evil vampires went crazy and bashed in everyone's skulls let's send them to prison!" doesn't go very far for understanding and thereby have a slight chance of preventing the next one.
-	-	I feel the same way.  It's like the only places for good discussion are the smaller subreddits, while the big ones get filled with pun threads and old memes. It's not as bad as he claims though -- there is *always* a good discussion going on in every thread on even the big subreddits.
0	3	I don't understand why this woman would order a rape. I could understand the rapists doing it, as horrible as that is, and I could understand ordering genocide, as horrible as that is, but what does ordering a rape accomplish, even in the mind of a bigoted, murderous, genocidal maniac?
0	5	Probably shouldn't have raped and genocided.
-	-	Contribute to the genocide of any number of people; life in prison.  
-	-	Check out the wikipedia article  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide  This genocide happened far quicker and with more efficiency than the holocaust. What's more terrifying is that there was no need to construct gas chambers and to use soldiers. This was the general populace, ensnared in a fervour. The section on media alone is terrifying.  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3572887.stm   Also check out that BBC article where it's confirmed that it was a final solution type scenario.    edit* From the wikipedia article;  "the official figures published by the Rwandan government estimated the number of victims of the genocide to be 1,174,000 in 100 days (10,000 murdered every day, 400 every hour, 7 every minute)." 
0	1	Fuck yr christ.
1	6	lol Tutsi   But for real, I know some Tutsi refuges from Burundi, their baby son was poisoned in their refuge camp for being a Tutsi. or something like that. It's been awhile.

0	3	10 year trial?! Horrible. I hope she rots.
-	-	you should read the whole thing. It ties together quite expertly.
-	-	For those who want more detail about Pauline, [this is an incredible article about her life](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/15/magazine/15RWANDA.html). It is quite rage inducing.
-	-	"The Bone Woman" By Klea Koff is a good book about her experience as a newly-grad, forensic anthropologist working for the UN exhuming mass graves in Rwanda (and a few other countries/crises). These exhumations were used as evidence in convicting many of the people responsible. It tells the story about the conditions she dealt with while on these missions, and most touchingly stories about bringing closure and answers to families who were searching for missing loved ones by identifying bodies (mostly by clothes and belongings).   It truly is sickening what horrors mankind is capable of when consumed by ignorance, greed, power, and hatred. And leave it to our beloved America to not get involved if there is no monetary gain.
0	2	I can see how you think that civil war such as this has little to do with a state's liberalism, but show me a democratic state with strong property rights and I'll show you a state free of genocide. Hand-in-hand is exactly it.   Edit to include the standard caveats that colonialism ruined any chance African countries have at installing such a regime today, &amp;c. Not arguing that point.
-	-	I'll preface my comment with the fact I didn't read this entire article...  However, be very cautious of convictions coming out of the Rwandan genocide. A lot of the testimony in the trials, particularly the gacaca ones, are ridiculous. It's a bunch of he said, she said, eyewitness testimony. I witnessed one trial where the evidence presented against someone was:  " I live one village over. 14 years ago i saw that person (who was like 30) assist in a roadblock during the genocide."  Really? Are you sure? And you're absolutely positive you can identify someone 14 years later? I've also had some Rwandan friends convicted in those courts for being forced to be involved. It's a really, really screwed up system in my opinion. 
0	1	Or Armenians, or Congolese Pygmies, or people of an 'incorrect' political orientation in Argentina, Chile, or the USSR, or...anyone they're not specifically told to care about.  Fuck, now I need a drink.
1	6	At least you tried, when you were in a position to try. Dont feel bad.
0	1	Shouldn't all modern nations be as accountable as the U.S. in this case? Or am I misinformed and America is the only country not doing everything to help?  I agree that these nations need aid to help prevent such atrocities, but I almost never hear "when will the Denmark stop the horrible events in Genocidia?!"
1	4	Yeah I recognize that. I'm still leary of that whole mess, honestly.  As another comment mentions, it's not cut and dry. Really screwed up situation over there. Shame, too, becuase Rwandans are some of the best people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting.
-	-	in america we have this luxury of "beyond a reasonable doubt" and the idea that it is better to let a guilty man go free than wrongly convict an innocent one. that's why this offends us. but that law was developed during a relatively peaceful era.
-	-	&gt;The major reasons why Africa  It sounds like you went to a 'democracy and capitalism hand-in-hand and all is well' university more so than that being anything but a superfluous analysis of the situation.
0	5	Come on, let's be fair here.   &gt;The reason the Holocaust happened while the world watched is because the world (for the most part) simply don't care about Jews.  FTFY, and for the most part, yes, I'd agree with that statement. There are numerous critiques of America's late entrance into the war that are centered on this fact. The saddest thing is that nobody *ever* decided to intervene in Rwanda, and Rwanda happened after we all supposedly learned our lesson about genocide and how horrible it is.
0	2	&gt;the average person has little reason to care   ...about the mass murder and genocide of an ethnic group? Of the systematic murder of 800.000-1,000,000 human beings?
-	-	That's uniquely true in Africa, though, because colonialism left a lot of borders where they shouldn't have been left. 
-	-	You seem to be forgetting that certain European ancestors of ours are directly responsible for the existence of the black population in the United States, not to mention that that population has only been able to build up a wealth base for 150 yearsâ€”and with the vast majority of that period offering no protection from Jim Crow laws and the like.  You also seem to be forgetting that Europe colonized Africa extensively and brutally (e.g., [The Herero and Namaqua Genocide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herero_and_Namaqua_Genocide) or [The Congo Free State](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State)), and those African states they artificially created have only very recently becomes independentâ€”with, of course, the majority of their national wealth remaining in European hands.  That's not to say white people are all to blameâ€”most of us had no hand whatsoever in any of these eventsâ€”but without the past actions of certain white people, Africa would be unrecognizable from what it is today.
1	6	Poor on poor crime more like it.  You don't see ghetto thugs hunting down rich black folk just to take them down a notch, do you?
1	7	So true.  Before the white man came to Africa, it was a peaceful, civilized, egalatarian utopia.
-	-	They did it to themselves. They answer for themselves.
-	-	There's room on the internet for both.
1	4	I didn't. This was *way* more interesting than amusing rage comics.
0	2	Typical nigger behavior. I bet Obama does the same shit. That's what happens when we let niggers run countries.

-	-	[Paul Rusesabagina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rusesabagina), the humanitarian whose story is told in the movie Hotel Rwanda, came to speak at the University I attend a few years ago.   They showed the movie in a large lecture hall and afterwards he spoke and answered questions for about an hour.   The lecture hall was packed, people were standing. It was incredible to see such an interest from young adults. 
-	-	Genocide while the world watched.  Horrific stuff, and yet many people don't realize the extent.  "We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families" is an eye opening book about this that I highly recommend.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0312243359/ref=redir_mdp_mobile/187-5167006-7036055

1	4	Good god.  I should have read that article a little at a time.  That was completely terrifying.  It's incredible how this type of thing is happening somewhere, pretty much all the time.  How can entire nations get wrapped up in this type of insanity?  It's mind boggling.
-	-	The *prefet* startled when he saw the two militiamen melt out of the shadows of the doorway and stride toward him, grim and purposeful. He turned around. A great scar stood in the alleyway. Not a scar - a man, his sweat gleaming in the dark moonlit night like a gash across the very fabric of the world. In his hand something steamed in the cold night. Blood on a machete.   The prefect felt his heart pound but he drew himself erect. "*Ecartez-vous!* Do you *know who I am*?" he commanded. Suddenly he was on his knees, a sharp throbbing pain in his knee. One of the militiamen had struck him with the butt of his rifle.  The scar laughed, a sound deep and rumbling, as if from deep in the earth. "I know well who you were, my friend," he grinned. "But you are not *prefet* any longer, are you? I am thinking you are just a little man now. Why are you out after curfew, little man? Have you come to kill the cockroaches with us?"  The prefet looked up at the scar towering over him, a face obscured by night. "The Tutsi are our neighbors. I will not let you harm them. I forbid it. Do not touch them, or there will be a reckoning."  The scar rumbled once more with laughter, and behind the prefet the militiamen brayed too. "You *forbid* it? Today, they brought truckloads of the cockroaches for me to kill with this machete. Truck after truck. I tried to keep track of how many I killed, but lost count. Then I tried to keep track of how many truckloads came, but lost count of that too. They came off the trucks to us naked, the schoolgirls, did you know that? Some patriot made arrangements, so it would be easier for us to rape them first. So tell me, little man, what have you forbidden?"  The prefet choked back a sob. So that was why the school was empty tonight. It was over, then. There was nothing left for him to do. "Still. There will be a reckoning," he said to the ground, in a whisper that was barely more than a sigh.  Somehow, the scar heard him. "A *reckoning*? I know well who you are, little man. You are a little man who lies with cockroaches. I think that makes you a cockroach yourself, that is who you are. But do you know who I am?"  The scar bent down and looked the prefet in the eye. Even now that it was no longer shrouded in night the scar's head was a great black faceless void. A voice came from within, sonorous and thrumming and carried from far, far away.  "I am Fear, little man, and Hate, and Death, and Power, and I say to you there will be *no reckoning*, I will gorge myself on this country and my machete will taste little girls and boys and their parents and grandparents too, and the world will look away because they do not know how to see the things I do, and all your neighbors will join me, too, and pick up machetes and work for me or they will die too like the cockroaches they are, for a month this land will be mine to rip and ravish and rape, and when I am done I will be gone, having had my fill, and a million cockroaches will have died in agony darkness and despair, and when they look back there will be no reckoning, just the uncounted graves. How do you reckon with hate? How do you reckon with death? No little man. There will be no reckoning. I will have already won."  The prefet looked up in wordless dismay as the faceless scar stood back up, and lifted the machete aloft, the metal glossy with the blood of his neighbors.   "I know this as surely as I know that you will die screaming: when they write of this night, in their pitiful attempts to make sense of it all, they will forget even your name. They will note only that you tried and failed and died to stop me. That is all the reckoning you will ever have of this night."  "They will note only that I tried and failed and died." the prefet said to himself, trying the words. "Well. Well." The scar cocked his head, uncomprehending.   Jean-Baptiste Habyarimana looked up defiant and spat at death: "I know who you are, monster. You're nothing. You're a shadow. You won't last the night. You won't win at all, and you know it."  The scar snarled as he brought the blade down, but Jean-Baptiste was content. *They will know I tried. That will be enough.*
1	4	Well said. How many good people die for doing the right thing, and how often do they go unsung. There should be a memorial day for tall those who died fighting against violence. 
1	8	Either really.  Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's *right*, but it's the case.
-	-	You seem to be ill-acquainted with a good chunk of human history.
-	-	Do be upfront about it, I don't buy the argument, but it seems to happen a lot:  The idea that any member of whatever group poses a threat and they all must be eradicated to protect some other group.  That's not a justification, but rather a possible scenario regarding what causes these things to happen. Other than: "Let's kill all those assholes!" that is...
-	-	I don't think it would fit through my tubes.
-	-	&gt;YOU DON'T EXPONENTIALLY ONE UP THEM.  I am pretty sure an eye for an eye is not the natural human response. I think it's actually more like an eye for your entire family.
-	-	Where did I imply such?
-	-	The average person has little reason to care, and the average person cares little, are two very different things.
-	-	It was certainly in a lot better shape than it is now. Having your people kidnapped by the millions tends to have negative effects on a culture.
-	-	Yes, nothing like that could ever happen in Germany, China, Russia, North America, Australia, Turkey ,the Dominican Republic, or Guatemala.
0	5	I think the biggest problem with the Gacaca model is that it doesn't emphasize reconcilliation enough. Similar "grassroot courts" from South Africa (which the Gacaca was modeled after) prioritized reconcilliation by imposing penalties on people who refused to admit and apologize for wrongdoing, but only gave a slap on the wrist to those that admitted their wrongdoing and apologized (as far as I've had it explained to me)  The one Gacaca I witnessed had two gentlemen who were completely apathetic, laughing while being questioned, who were quite obviously guilty (according to my translator), who got off because no one could prove they did anything conclusively. The one young man who admitted his wrongdoing and profusely apologized (not killing anyone, but being a part of the roadblocks as a young child, under 10 years old) was sentenced to multiple years in prison and another year of community service.  Something wrong with that freakin system if you ask me.
-	-	Not my impression they tend stay out of conflicts: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Denmark
0	5	Well, of course the Holocuast "happened to Europeans" as Jews are also included in that group.  However, it's inaccurate to say that we didn't intervene earlier because we didn't "care about Europe or Europeans"; rather, we didn't care about Jews, "homosexuals, communists, mentally and physically handicapped, the Gypsies, the undesirables, the politically not-in-favour, etc." If the Nazis tried to systematically kill everyone of French origin, or everyone in England, we would most likely have gotten involved much earlier. Because the targeted groups were people who we didn't care much about because of racism, ablism, and other forms of discrimination, we were much less willing to get involved.
-	-	And for each of those "genocidal" states with "public" ownership of property, I can show you Western interference which either created the environment (Rwanda, Sri Lanka) or exacerbated it (Yugoslavia)--often in the name of creating this very same private property ideal.  However the crux of my disagreement with your post is your use of a weak and disassociative term such as 'handover'--as opposed to something more accurate along the lines of: educated, trained, installed and unabatedly aided--and then making the leap to something as trivial as private property, a concept as alien to precolonial Africa as their national boundaries, while not only ignoring other more important factors, but failing to attribute this very area of economic development to the regimes that the colonialists empowered. It's more of an interesting anecdote than it is a 'major reason'.
1	6	Could you expand on why you don't like it?
-	-	wtf? No.
-	-	Because all black people don't look the same aristideau.
-	-	Tutsis are tall and light skinned.  Hutus are short and black.
-	-	The book "Shake Hands With the Devil"  is a great (read: horrifying) look into the UN politics and the events on the ground as the situation deteriorated from ceasefire negotiations to all out genocide. It is written by the UN commander who commanded the peacekeeping delegation and was ordered to not intervene militarily. That book taught me about the power of hate speech and why we should be concerner with hate spewing pundits on TV and radio.   http://www.amazon.com/Shake-Hands-Devil-Failure-Humanity/dp/0786715103
1	7	I would also suggest Romeo Dallaire's Shake Hands With The Devil.
1	4	Thank you.
1	7	I also recommend Shake Hands With The Devil. 
0	2	No you are confused, you are describing 1959 event called [Wind of destruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_of_destruction). This is article about 1994 Rwandan genocide.
-	-	You deserve what you willfully tolerate.
-	-	Many wrongs in fact:  - Tutsi refers to 'aristocrats' and Hutu to 'peasant'. Ethnically they are absolutely the same. It is a social distinction not an ethnic one. (They have the same language, same music, same danses, same wedding ceremonials, etc.) Tutsis were free to marry Hutus. A Hutu women married to a Tutsi became Tutsi (that's why they were also killed together with their children).  - There was no uprisings from the Hutu before colonial times. None. (Doesn't mean the Mwami was always a benevolent ruler).  - The Tutsi had friendly relations with the Belgians as long as the conservative party was in power in Belgium.  - The Hutus set up a government after the Socialists won the general elections in Belgium. They wanted to 'free' the poor majority from the rule of the minority. Massacres started immediately against the Tutsi.  - The exiled Tutsis demanded for decades to be compensated but the UN ignored them. The Tutsis in Uganda, Burundi, Congo and Tanzania were heavily discriminated by the local population.  - When back, the Tutsis agreed to share power with the Hutus on two conditions : reparation and right to return for refugees (Arusha agreement)  - The genocide is not a response to Tutsis 'starting some shit'. It was a carefully executed plan by an extremist group of Hutus not accepting the peace agreement : within 100 days 95% of the Tutsi population of Rwanda was killed, often in sadistic ways.
1	4	I thought this was a very good ones too: [Beyond the Gates](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420901/)
0	3	I was on the verge of tears watching Ghosts of Rwanda. The carnage and destruction left in the wake of the genocide is unreal.
0	1	That's all very impersonal. It's not offensive to me (I'm not a surburban white folk I guess) but unless you're incredibly distant and inhuman about the matter, genocide as a government response is just a little bit on the WRONG side. However much you might want to stretch a little 'justification'  The people being raped and slaughtered had as much influence on the state of affairs as you do on with your current government's rullings. I'd imagine a lot of them didn't give a flying fuck of the differences between Tutsi and Hutu.  
1	4	Good points, I presume.  When any western power bitches about a foreign country or crime committed by a regime there is usually a shittty smell coming from their spokespeople 
0	2	My impression is that France was much more complicit in the genocide than the US.
-	-	And here I thought memorial day was for barbecues and the beach.
1	8	Well I was being hyperbolic but -  Oh my god that guy got -94 downvotes.    If only that that happened every time a good discussion was to be derailed by a meme.   Normally though the meme is the top rated.  I'm actually happy that reddit downvoted this dingdong.    But frequently, most of the thread and the top rated comments are canned phrases.  At least when I want it to be a serious original discussion. I will check those subreddits out btw. 
-	-	And don't forget the mid-90's were also when the Algerian massacres began.
0	2	I recommend that people watch the movie Hotel Rwanda. It's easy to brush these things off as "crazy shit that happens in other countries that doesn't affect me". For the average idiot like myself, it really helps make these events more real.
-	-	"Nyiramasuhuko and her son have been sentenced to jail for life in prison. Four other suspects were given different sentences," the ICTR spokesman Danford Mpumilwa told Reuters by telephone from the court.  http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/un-court-jails-first-woman-for-rwandan-genocide/
0	5	One thing that always shocks me is how people are so disconnected from the colonization of Africa in terms of how recent it was. No one seems to realize that MOST colonization didn't end until the 60's and 70's. It was primarily Europeans that were still actively oppressing these people that they "ruled" until just 40 years ago.   If you meet an African of the age of 45 or over, chances are they witnessed and participated in the (long and painful) end of colonization. It's as if most people just assume it happened over 100 years ago and thus is irrelevant to present day status. 
-	-	Yeah I sooo agree, and those tutsi "niggers" soooo deserved it!
-	-	You're right, that is an absolutely fantastic book. I second that recommendation.
1	8	SpontaneousFiction, That was an excellent rendition of Jean-Baptiste Habyarimana's last moments.  I like to imagine they went something like that.   To all who will read this, Learning how families were tortured and butchered like this really makes my problems seem so petty by comparison.  It really makes one wonder how in the world we can stop such things from repeating... and it makes me realize that one of the common threads linking this genocide to the others is deep division between groups of people.  If people treated each other as they wanted to be treated themselves, this horrific thing might be less common.  That's my attempt to spread the way that I'm trying to live.  I'm not great at it but - I keep at it.  Hopefully, it'll help with stuff like this.

0	2	I saw a documentary on this guy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Butt_Naked one of the rebel leaders in the civil war, interesting guy. Raped, beheaded, etc. But the thing he admitted to that hit me the most(if it was true) was snatching up boys and girls and eating them with his rebel troops before war so it gave them power. Also he always fought naked. Admitted to killing thousands of people. I don't believe it all, but it sure is possible. I find the thousands of people a big stretch, at least him himself killing thousands. Still, crazy shit.
0	5	Sometimes I really wish hell existed for people who do this kind of shit. But again, I think the whole human kind is to blame...
1	6	I knew it was a large massacre, but 800000 people killed in 100 days??  HOLY SHIT.

1	6	At risk of offending the righteous indignation of suburban white folks about the whole matter, tell me if I have this right:  - The Tutsi minority ran the country under the Mamwi and generally did what most minorities in power tend to do: oppress the majority. - This went on for a while with the usual uprisings and whatnot. - The Tutsi regime struck up friendly relations with the Colonials and kept things going the same for a while. - There was a coup, the Tutsis got thrown out of power with some of the most influential ones going into exile. - The Hutus set up a government. - The exiled Tutsis come back to start some shit and take the place back. - The genocide is the Hutus response.  Is that about right?  If so, how is this in the least bit surprising?  I may be a bit squeamish when it comes to mass rape and machete killing, but it would seem that the Hutus had something of a point.
-	-	When in Africa...
-	-	Americas, the blood of Rwanda is on your hands. Your tax dollars at work.
-	-	I have always wondered how they could distinguish a Hutu from a Tutsi. In Nazi Germany it would have been easy to seperate Jews from Germans by their names and physical features. So how do Hutus and Tutsis tell one from the other?.
0	2	Yeah let's concentrate on past genocides and crimes while these are actually going on as we speak. 
-	-	Actually out of the 21 million or so people who died in the concentration camps, only 6 million were Jews. It's just that after the war, the homosexuals, communists, mentally and physically handicapped, the Gypsies, the undesirables, the politically not-in-favour, etc. did not have massive lobbies or money to talk about their experiences. Jacekplacek is correct in stating that the Holocaust happened to Europeans, and not just the Jews.  
-	-	Agreed. I visited genocide suspects in Rwandese prisons for a year in 1999.   Given the complexity of the cases, the state of the juridic system in Rwanda (there were almost no lawyer, judge or prosecutor left after the genocide : all were killed or left the country) and the overcrowding in the prisons, the new government had to find a solution. It was gacaca. Not ideal, not without innocents being jailed due to neighbours lurking on their properties, but no western organisation had any better idea.  By the way, it is quite remarkable that the post-genocide Tutsi-led governement suppressed the death penalty at the same time those tribunals started.
-	-	&gt;Let's also say that **every member of this group constitutes a current or future threat.**  You lost me.  
1	8	Maybe someone can make it into a rage comic.
-	-	I worked in Rwanda for more than a year post-genocide.   Hotel Rwanda is a very poor movie (for several reasons, just to name one : it doesn't say why it happened), there is only one movie that truly depicts what happened and why : 'Sometimes in April' by Raoul Peck : http://youtu.be/IxEVcfOKzsY  *EDIT: The full movie is also on YouTube: http://youtu.be/IxEVcfOKzsY  The best documentary is 'Ghosts of Rwanda' by PBS Frontline: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ghosts/  For books 'Shake hands...' and 'We wish to inform you...' are definetly must-reads.
-	-	And "Shooting Dogs", and haven't yet watched yet but "Shake Hands with the Devil - The Journey of Romeo Dallaire" which tells the story of the man in charge of the UN mission to Rwanda. 
-	-	And, for what it's worth Paul Rusesabagina is essentially persona non grata back in Rwanda. The reasons are complex, but I think boil down to his failure to give sufficient credit to the RPF (Paul Kagame's political party/army).  &lt;I've been to Rwanda twice, trying to make investments. Never was able to come to terms with the locals, despite my best efforts. I stayed in the "Hotel Rwanda" on my second trip.&gt;
0	3	The movie wasn't that great.  It reduced the event to a mediocre tv movie.  But the book We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families is pretty incredible.
-	-	&gt; And leave it to our beloved America to not get involved if there is no monetary gain.    Ugh, so true it hurts.  Especially when you consider the profit is not a profit for the country or its people, but a select few corporations.
-	-	Dude.  This is reddit.  The only thing we can do is reference a lame meme.  For example every time anything serious about Russia comes it, the thread automatically is derailed into an "In Soviet Russia" thread.   Serious discussion for, this place is not.
-	-	I think that if firstworldproblems isn't created as a huge joke, it's one of the worst subreddits in existence. Yes, you should never have any negative opinion on anything, ever. Somewhere someone has it worse than you so your own personal perspective is entirely irrelevant. What, you're comparing your standards to those of those around you? You *monster*.  
-	-	The article is about a trial in Arusha by the ICT not the gacaca popular tribunals.
1	4	No doubt there were those who participated who were afraid not too.  Especially given the extreme level of sheer violence.     Unfortunately with large-scope events this evil - the aftermath is never cut and dry and the no system put in place to bring the perpetrators to justice is going to be perfect.   
0	2	Kill their children and rape their wives, obviously.
-	-	Is this genocide class a class for future dictators?
-	-	Rwanda has a very complex social structure. It is quite possible (although not conclusive as there is no archeological evidence) that the cattle herders  (tutsi) came to Rwanda from the horn of Africa some 400 years ago.  What makes this hypothesis doubtful is that these pastoralists embraced the culture of the indigenous Bantu, while being socially and economically dominant. Usually dominant groups impose their culture or stay distinct, but not in Rwanda. As said there is no cultural difference btwn Tutsis and hutus nowadays.  Belgian anthropologists tried to differentiate them by taking skull measurements but nothing conclusive emerged.   As an old survivor told me: "before the white men came we didn't knew if we were hutu or tutsi. We were simply Rwandese."    The physical difference btwn some tutsis and hutus are perfectly explainable by nutrition and privileged marriage.  The first have a meat and milk diet, the second mostly vegetables. Tall and light-skinned women are most desired, making these physical features more prominent in the elite social class. 
0	1	&gt; Why not?  **BECAUSE THEY'RE MOTHERFUCKING HUMAN BEINGS, THAT'S WHY. BECAUSE WHEN SOMEONE TREATS YOU MONSTROUSLY, YOU DON'T EXPONENTIALLY ONE UP THEM.**  What in the flying hell is wrong with you?

0	1	fucking perfect.
0	1	Same here. I needed a reason to stop reading rage comics anyway.
1	4	Lighten up, Francis. 
-	-	The irony Derbl is probably referring to is your phrasing, "fighting against violence" and the fact that there is a "memorial day" and it is for soldiers who died in combat.
1	6	8 hours of sunlight? I thought Rwanda was in central Africa, not Russia.
0	2	so true...it was criminal and he should have been held accountable by the world for it.
-	-	He told you not to trust him.
0	1	The Rwandan Genocide, the act that I can always trace back as the catalyst for my transformation from staunch Christian to Atheist. Itâ€™s funny to think that the seed of doubt was first planted on a harmless Missionary Trip to Rwanda and Uganda. The catch, it just happened to fall on the 10 year anniversary of this horrible atrocity. I still remember listening to the survivors stories and thinking what the fuck godâ€¦One that always comes to mind is the one from a 12 year old boy. I first met him when he came down to play soccer with us (it was a sports ministry) but alas he couldnâ€™t, he could only sit and watchâ€¦Why? His arms and legs were cut off by his father, why? Because his mom was a Tutsiâ€¦even as Iâ€™m typing this Iâ€™m fucking cutting onionsâ€¦that is just one of the many stories, so many moreâ€¦so manyâ€¦   Anyways Iâ€™m sure this will be buried under other stories/comments, but if you happen to stumble on this thanks for reading, just thought I would share 
-	-	Rwanda is especially tragic because UN troops were already there! But they had no mandate/support to do anything.  Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RomÃ©o_Dallaire &gt;Seeing the situation in Rwanda deteriorating rapidly, Dallaire pleaded for logistical support and reinforcements of 2,000 soldiers for UNAMIR; he estimated that a total of 5,000 well-equipped troops would give the UN enough leverage to put an end to the killings. The UN Security Council refused, partly due to US opposition. US policy on interventions had become skeptical following the death of several U.S. soldiers in Mogadishu, Somalia the year before; this new policy was outlined in Presidential Decision Directive 25 by President Clinton. The Security Council voted to reduce UNAMIR further to 270 troops. Since the UN mandate had not changed, the Belgian troops started evacuating, and the Europeans withdrew. â€¦ Following the withdrawal of Belgian forces, whom Dallaire considered his best-trained[11] and best-equipped, Dallaire consolidated his contingent of Pakistani, Canadian, Ghanaian, Tunisian, and Bangladeshi soldiers in urban areas and focused on providing areas of "safe control" in and around Kigali. 
0	2	I could not agree more.  It is strange to me that we spend over a trillion dollars fighting in reaction to 2000 americans dying, and spend next to nothing on the systematic slaughtering of hundreds of thousands in countries like Rwanda.
-	-	I think you meant Europe, Asia, Australia, North and South America... but yeah..I haven't heard of 500,000 killed in a span of 100 days in those continents within the last 50 years.. so no.
-	-	false dictomy much? What he means is that european colonial powers have long denied africans the right to develop at their own pace into the kinds of societies they want. Intead they ruled with an iron fist for a few hundred years and then packed up and left about 60 years ago. 60 years is a very short time to get a whole continent to a point where it can stand on it's own feet after something like that.
-	-	Any relation to Juvenal Habyarimana?
-	-	All your reasons seem to be political rather than about the movie itself.
-	-	There is a less-than-subtle irony in that last sentence.
-	-	What, Robert Paulson had a name change? 
0	2	"You wouldn't download an Oprah, would you?"  Shit, I probably would.
1	8	That is simply not true. The primary motivation behind the US' reluctance to aid Rwanda was the Black Hawk Down fiasco in Somalia, which resulted in the death of a handful of US troops, that occurred not long before the Rwandan genocide. And after the ten Belgian UN blue helmets were murdered while guarding the acting Prime Minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, all the white people were evacuated, and the UN pulled out.  It's understood these days that the Western powers were not willing to sacrifice their own troops to save the lives of black Africans. All the hand-wringing in the world by Western leaders, including President Clinton, does not change the fact that we abandoned the Rwandans, and knowingly left them to die.
-	-	At least this holiday's symbols can actually be construed into something related to the holiday. On a side note, I actually can't get my boyfriend (a former Marine) to go to the beach at all.
1	7	I registered just to upvote you for the immediate solemn respect your comment gave me.
0	3	He mad. 
-	-	hutus and tutsis are names given to separate the SAME RACE OF PEOPLE - people who were chosen to be either hutu or tutsi were based on the the whims and agendas of those who colonized the region at the time... guess who they were?  EDIT: not having faith that many people know the history of western imperialism in Africa. So the answer would be the Europeans who participated in the Imperialist movement (not all white people ok!? - lots of awesome white people out there)
0	1	This is how you genocide.  Reminds me of [Babi Yar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babi_Yar) in the Holocaust.  &gt;The difficulties resulting from such a large scale action â€“ in particular concerning the seizure â€“ were overcome in Kiev by requesting the Jewish population through wall posters to move. Although only a participation of approximately 5,000 to 6,000 Jews had been expected at first, more than 30,000 Jews arrived who, until the very moment of their execution, still believed in their resettlement, thanks to an extremely clever organization.  These sick fucks learn the lessons of history and continue to refine their evil art.
-	-	Butt Naked was a leader during the Liberian civil war, approximately 2000 miles from Rwanda, just FYI 
0	5	You're missing the point as well.  There's whole lot of barbaric things around the planet that you are blissfully unaware of. Some of those things involve decades of oppression, turmoil, and hatred to the point where genocide seems perfectly reasonable.  Even suburbanites like yourself and CAPTAIN CAPS above aren't all that far removed from tribal warfare.
1	4	Nice to know there're are some other thinking folks around :-)  I think this even goes beyond regular idealism, I was waiting for someone to take a sort of 'non-violence at all costs' position. I don't agree with that position, but I do understand and respect it.  These folks, I think, are latching on to a sort of popular idealism that makes them feel civilized and therefore superior. I'm sure if they ever spent any time amongst "the downtrodden" they claim to support they'd be quite surprised at the reception they'd likely get.   Thanks btw.
-	-	&gt;They got involved because of political and economic reasons. If you actually look at the historical documents of them time, you'll find that the moral justification bit only got invented after the war.  I am absolutely not disagreeing with that. I'm just saying that it's inaccurate to characterize the lack of involvement as being predicated on the world not "caring about Europe and Europeans" as an earlier commenter suggested. The main criticism I referred to above was that even after hearing about the atrocities being committed in Germany and Austria and, later in the concentration camps, *prior to any military actions in the Netherlands*, the US was reluctant to get involved. Many historians have argued that if the groups being targeted were not those which faced significant discrimination in the US at the time, the US's military response would have occurred earlier.
0	2	This has nothing to do with property. I'm sort of insulted by your assertion and somewhat buoyed by peroperopero's comments that the reasons are deeper and belie a quick soundbite that people are all so eager to give. "It's all about property rights" and "handovers". You can't distill it like that. Have you read the wikipedia article? It's one of the longest I've ever read.
1	4	Good.
-	-	The reason the Rwandan massacre happened while the world watched is because the world (for the most part) simply doesn't care about Africa or Africans.  That's the only explanation I can think of for the bullshit that happened.  People knew this was happening and they did nothing.  They passed it off as some other tribal conflict between "savages" and then went to sleep.
-	-	I teach in a very ethnically diverse high school and had my seniors watch Hotel Rwanda this past year.  I overheard this conversation during the movie:  "Why?  Why are they even killing each other?" "Because the white people left before they could kill them."  Amazing class discussion afterwards. 
0	3	I was recovering from serious injuries from an automobile collision when the Rwandan genocide happened, and circumstances were such that I never knew about until 11 years later, when I was doing a make-up assignment in college in which I had to watch a Frontline video on the genocide. I watched the video in stunned silence, forcing myself to accept what I was seeing.  The most horrible thing to me about that event was not the one million humans that died, although that is indeed horrifying. The most horrible thing about that event is that we, the USA, self-proclaimed policemen of the world, had military troops there, in Rwanda, when the genocide commenced, and WE DID NOTHING! Men and women were slaughtered and women were savagely raped a few feet from where US soldiers stood, yet following the direct orders of President Bill Clinton, WE DID NOTHING.
-	-	Just so everyone knows, the Tutsis were killed because they had lighter skin and were taller, and had been afforded higher status under colonial rule.
0	2	While I do appreciate that these people are still being put on trial to this day, I do understand that there is no punishment grand enough that could ever balance out the horrors of the Rwandan genocide. Nothing can ever be done to the perpetrators to alleviate all pain from the Tutsis.   Therefore, while we must still punish the war criminals, we must focus on an even more important task: awareness. Everyone should know of the Rwandan genocide, of the atrocities and inhumane acts. An ounce of prevention is worth several tons of cure. We can never right the wrongs of the genocide. But we can make sure that nothing similar ever occurs again.
0	1	if we get involved, everybody bitches about it...if we don't get involved everybody bitches about it.
1	6	This is why we can't have nice civilizations.
0	1	TIL there were a lot of [massacres in 1994](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=1994+massacres&amp;go=Go)
0	5	Too easy a sentence for this evil, unfortunately.   
-	-	I read "A Sunday at the Pool in Kigali" - I'm not sure how accurate this information was, but it certainly opened my eyes to the ethnic conflict in the area.  Have you read it, and would you be able to tell me how accurate it is?  I'm going to have a look at the books suggested above.
0	5	"Ghosts of Rwanda": soul-numbing, chilling stuff while looking down the swinging blade of pure evil...especially the interview of Fergal Keane. One of the things I hate most about this was President Clintons lack of action in preventing this tragedy. 
-	-	Yikes, strike two. 
-	-	[Inappropriate given the subject matter but the first thing that popped into my head](http://tutsiroll.ytmnd.com/)
-	-	Read it about a year ago. A must read book. I third it.
1	6	Also, I recommend The Blue Sweater-- I think this woman is actually written about in this book Pre-genocide. She helps build microfinance institutions for her community and was the first of three women parliamentarians, if I'm not mistaken. 
0	5	Three things bother me particularly about 'Hotel Rwanda':  - During the whole movie you don't actually see the genocide. It's always in the background, never in your face. 'Sometimes in April' shoves it right through your throat and recollects all the stories that the survivors told me (the militias, the dogs, the UN, the checkpoints, the radio, the coward white men).  - You don't make the first movie on the rwandese genocide telling the story of 'the good hutu'. Imagine if the first movie on the Holocaust would have been 'Schindler's List'... No, first you tell the horror and why it came to be, then you can tell the stories of the few heroes such as Paul Rusesabagina, Dallaire or of the few white priests who saved lives. The big picture is simply missing in Hotel Rwanda.  - It was not shot on location. Having been in Rwanda, it is something that matters, because as Dallaire said, Rwanda is paradise. All year btwn 20Â°C and 32Â°C, the rain never lasts long, 8 hours of sunlight every day and everything just grows : the fertile ground is at some locations 2 metres deep (!!!). It was hell in paradise.
-	-	Maybe I should read the story before the comments.
1	6	I think it really comes down to someone's opinion on morality and human worth.  Should we help where we can?  Personally, I do not feel that Americans are worth any more than someone in another country.    If we had these sort of atrocities in America, we would act.  With other countries, we do not.  Why is that?  Are they worth less?  Can we not afford to?  I don't believe there is an easy way to draw a line of where/when we should act with regards to how much we spend, help, etc.    That said, I would love to see somebody justify why we *should* be in Iraq but *not* have helped out in Rwanda.  Our priorities, they are messed up.
-	-	"Lack of action" is a charitable description of what he did. 
1	4	You have a point, but the US get involved with wars more often than other countries, it's not an undeserved reputation.
0	2	Particularly considering it was European colonial involvement that did a lot to instigate and perpetuate the racial divide and classism between the Hutus and the Tutsis.  If I'm recalling correctly, all colonial powers in Rwanda for the past 200 years played some pretty apparent favoritism with the Tutsi people, creating social tension that eventually lead to explosive conflict.  
0	2	I think America catches more of the flak because it has a history of entering other nations during these situations (Korea, Vietnam, Iraq). China's never really had an interventionist policy so it wasn't expected of them.
1	6	I think the double standard that is being criticised is that the US is more than willing to get involved if there is monetary interrest (Iraq, Libya etc.) but not so much when it's Sudan or Rwanda.   Denmark tends to stay out of most conflicts (Though they are in iraq for some reason) so them staying out of Rwanda is not something surprising. Atleast there isnt as much of a double standard involved.
-	-	You should be able to move some numbers around and secure a loan to bribe him to go.
0	1	Yupp the belgians actually came down with the peace delegation but were pulled home when 30 or so belgian soldiers were killed. When the French finally arrived on the scene it was more to secure french interrests in the area than to help stop the madness.
0	1	How clear do I have to make this?  It's not a fucking excuse.  It's a reason.  Understanding why these things happen is far more important than your bourgeois sensibilities.
1	8	Here's a thought. Say it's not an excuse it's a reason in your first post instead of cleverly alluding. Bourgeoisie Indeed.
-	-	Belgium was the former colonial ruler of Rwanda. I'm talking about a [2008 Rwandan report](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7542418.stm) that concluded that France had played an active role in the genocide by arming and training Hutu militas.
-	-	They were at the origin. During the genocide, they chickened out after the killing of ten of their men. The men on the ground were furious against their government and the UN. You can see their reaction at 0:16 in this video : http://www.ina.fr/histoire-et-conflits/autres-conflits/video/CAB94071729/onu-boutros.fr.html
0	2	Okay, again, how does the fact that it happens over and over make it an excuse for genocide. Because something happens it is right? Oh it's "human nature" though hundreds millions of people managed to live their entire lives without murdering another person, let alone hunting down entire hundreds of thousands?  I really don't understand the point you're trying to make as relates to the original statements.  "This isn't an excuse for genocide" "Why not" "Because they're human"  next follows  "You don't know history"  and  "There are a lot of bad things you don't know about. People get angry and they think genocide is reasonable."  The original question is *how is that an excuse*.  How is people getting angry an excuse for genocide?
1	6	Considering the username you chose to do it with, I'm not sure how I feel about that. :P  Thanks? :P
-	-	The 100,000 civilians killed, although messed up, was during a time of war and it ended the war quick. I feel disgusted to say this but losing 100,000 lives is better than the millions that would've died if Japan didn't surrender.   But you do have a point, I previously thought that the Rwanda genocide was the worst but after some research it's not..  http://www.scaruffi.com/politics/dictat.html  but if you take into account the size of the Rwanda (size of the US State Maryland), the span in which these killings occurred and the % of tuti's who were killed relative to their population, it has to be one of the top 3 worst genocide within the last 200 years. 
0	2	&gt; ''Hutu soldiers took my mother outside,'' Rose told me, ''stripped off her clothes and raped her with a machete.'' On that first day, 20 family members were slaughtered before her eyes.
0	1	Wow, couldn't make it past the first page of that article. Fucked up.
-	-	"Soon after Pauline's arrival in town, cars mounted with loudspeakers crisscrossed Butare's back roads, announcing that the Red Cross had arrived at a nearby stadium to provide food and guarantee sanctuary. By April 25, thousands of desperate Tutsis had gathered at the stadium.  It was a trap. Instead of receiving food and shelter, the refugees were surrounded by men..."  Speechless
-	-	Except that it has happened again since Rwanda.  [Sudan](http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/africa/sudan) remains a place of conflict, and now the [Nuba](http://www.npr.org/2011/06/24/137389845/new-republic-blind-to-the-dawn-of-new-darfur) are targets.  The DRC is one of the worst places in the world to be a woman, with rapes and killings occurring [regularly](http://www.nation.co.ke/News/100+DRC+villagers+raped+and+attacked+/-/1056/1188136/-/14cv9q5z/-/), and the conflict there has caused more deaths than occurred during [WWII](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1198921,00.html).  The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) was responsible for 330 deaths in [one afternoon](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hI_hgWuXs1fg7QSrYnNtm6y_RM8A?docId=CNG.9a529bd9225705d57efe330623713dcd.6f1) in 2004, and continues to terrorize and attack the people of several countries neighboring Uganda.  We're not making sure that nothing similar to Rwanda happens again.  Some of these conflicts are mineral related, and many of us have supported them simply by purchasing the electronic devices we use to talk about these things on reddit.  If there's something we're gaining from the conflict (cheap minerals, cheap oil), we don't complain.  It's not on the evening news, and most of us have no idea what's going on.

-	-	That's a LOT of Scissoring
1	6	&gt; BBC East Africa correspondent Will Ross says Nyiramasuhuko showed no emotion as she was sentenced.  Why would she? She's being sentenced outside of her home country by people who had nothing to do with it. Why should she care that they disapprove?
-	-	I say she should get gangbanged then sent to jail. 
0	2	Say what now? You're displaying a lot of ignorance there. 1/ I hope you're not assuming that you could recognise all the Jews based on their dark hair and hooked noses? It just ain't so.  2/ You are obviously assuming without even looking into it, that black people anywhere will just look the same... And even that they wouldn't have different types of name?   Come on..
0	1	&gt; "...Butare was once home to a large mix of Hutu and Tutsi people, and there was some resistance there to the orders to carry out the massacres. The government of which Nyiramasuhuko was a member dismissed the most senior district official - a man who opposed the genocide. He was never seen again. When he was replaced, the massacres began and militias were flown in from the Rwandan capital Kigali to assist."  Unnamed senior district official: You did the right thing, and you paid the price for your uncommon courage.   And I do not even know your name.  Fuck everything about this.  
0	1	I once saw an interview with a Hutu who was married to a Tutsi woman.  When the mob came to their house to kill her, he had to pay them so they would shoot her instead of carving her up with a machete - they then proceeded to kill her in front of his eyes.  Whenever I feel rage start to build up over a Firstworldproblem, I think about that guy.
0	1	I remember learning about this in my genocide class a couple semesters before here at Auburn University.  I was then shocked to find out that one of these guys lives here in the United States.  IN the Auburn Opelika area in Alabama of all places.  Read some of the comments about it, and people seem to downplay the Belgium involvement in this whole mess.  And not to jump on the "White people are evil" bandwagon, but Africa was pretty much carved up by European forces, and despite having their own internal problems with each other, European and Arabic forces further crippled the continent by the raping of Africa's natural resources is the reason why Africa is in the position it is today.  sure they had things like slavery before the Europeans came down, but there were some forms of slavery that not only provided freedom eventually for the enslaved but also allowed them to marry into the families of their masters and have some respect.  And when people say European or whites are the cause of all this, i don't think it should be taken as ALL but the rich ones capable of manipulating the rest into going in a direction that they want to go.  IF you want to see evidence of that in today's world take a look at the United States government.

WWII was upwards of 60 million.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties  
0	1	africa is a seriously fucked up continent.
0	1	I don't disagree with your argument there at all. The colonizing countries arbitrarily drew national boundaries, installed puppet governorships and generally exploited the native populations to their benefit -- there was nothing 'free' about the colonists' regimes at all. Their lip-service to property ownership was only to enrich privateering corporations whose charge was to gut the continent of its natural resources.  Indeed, the 'return' of sovereignty to Africans over the last century exacerbated the problem by handing over the reigns to favorite political parties/leaders who ended up being genocidal, dictatorial maniacs. You're precisely in the right in your charge that the colonizing countries aided and abetted in this process.  The solution is figuring out how to redraw national boundaries respecting historical tribal nations and letting them do what they please -- hence sovereignty. What I am arguing, and where I think we differ, is that we have a different interpretation on what private property actually is and looks like in a peaceful democracy, and whether it promotes civil life and reduces inter-cultural conflict.  Edit: Grammar and syntax
-	-	I upvoted you :)  On the principle you are absolutely right. The first mistake by Kagame was to imprison every citizen that participated in the genocide.  4 categories were made :  1. Profiting from the chaos (looting, f.eg) (up to 5 yrs) 2. Killing not out of your own free will (up to 10 years) 3. Killing out of your own free will (up to 20 years) 4. Killing with atrocities or by being a leader (life in prison)  Because the justice system was so slow (for the reasons I explained above), in 2005 all categories 1 and 2 had done their time without ever seing a judge. It was impossible to release them without some sort of justice done, the genocide survivors and relatives would never accept a release without a trial. To speed up the liberation process, they introduced these grassroots tribunals. Unfortunately in the first months, many could be liberated, but many were also imprisoned.  However, globally the number of detainees related to the genocide has decreased from 300'000 when I was there (1999-2000) to 20'000 today.

-	-	I would also like to recommend "Left to Tell" by Immaculee Ilibagiza. 
-	-	Awareness on a national level is nothing more than a gilded song and dance. The US finished the holocaust memorial museum in 1993 proclaiming messages of 'never forget'; a year later they refused to even call the events in Rwanda 'genocide.'
0	5	Perhaps your students should look closer at home and ask why black-on-black crime is so high and kill each other while other communities aren't as self-destructive.  I have a hard time accepting the white man being the blame for all black violence in the world.
-	-	&gt;Because the white people left before they could kill them   The white people left before the blacks could kill the white people, or the white people left before the white people could kill the black people?
0	1	Harsh. I deplore ignorance as much as I am guilty of it. But the average person has little reason to care and less power to do anything about it.  It's terrible, but it's true :(
1	8	I think it's less that people don't care about the situation and more that they don't know about it; if U.S. networks had reported the details of the genocide like they do the lives of celebrities, I imagine that many people would have been up in arms 
-	-	&gt; The reason the killing fields massacre happened while the world watched is because the world (for the most part) simply doesn't care about Asia or Asians.  &gt; The reason the Holocaust happened while the world watched is because the world (for the most part) simply doesn't care about Europe or Europeans.  &gt; The reason the Holodomor happened while the world watched is because the world (for the most part) simply doesn't care about Eurasia or Eurasians.  FTFY
-	-	My African Politics professor in college was the US Ambassador to Rwanda during the escalation of the genocide. Things got so serious at the embassy that the Marines had to airlift them out of the compound in the middle of the chaos, and his deputy was shot while attempting to board the chopper. The man has some amazing stories.  The major reasons why Africa had -- and continues to have -- these problems are twofold: first, the colonization of Africa and the subsequent handover of colonies to non-elected dictators; and, second, the lack of any property rights regime in any of these now-failed states.
0	2	The major distinction between precolonial and colonial slave systems was their approach to the value of a slave. Colonialism and the advent of capitalism are symbiotic: prior, slaves *themselves* were of value; after, it was their *labour* output. Imagine the difference on the quality of life.
	Hero.
1	4	Gee thanks.  I don't think anybody else has ever seen Hotel Rwanda.
1	6	Wow, that reference is old.
0	1	I wish reddit found this as interesting as rage comics. 
0	2	Yeah, a discussion about a man who tried to stand up to the Rwandan genocide probably isn't the best time to reference a lame meme.  
-	-	Butbutbutbut women neeeeeeeeeeever take part in atrocity willingly. It must be some evil man's fault. Let's have a take back tge night march in her name.
0	3	Great - but incredibly horrifying - article. The more succinct news stories about the guilty verdict just don't convey the gravity of it.

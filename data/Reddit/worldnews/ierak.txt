1	6	No, it's not the surprise factor. Most human beings would feel renewed sorrow that so much pointless carnage has been done under the banner of a flag that so many we know have fought and died for but is being used now for only greed, empire and political careers.  You miss the moral point and the political point.  Wars are not supposed to kill civilians, it's basically illegal as attested to by civilized nations' promulgation of the Geneva Conventions and other protocols on war over more than a century.   Even worse you totally miss the point that killing Saddam Hussein and tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Iraqi civilians was not "a war" IT WAS AN INVASION BASED ON A LIE.   You do not feel outrage because you're cool with people losing their lives for nothing.  There is no real moral or political correlation between WWII and the US invasion of Iraq.  "My God"? You have a God?  Odin? Zeus? The Old Testament hairy thunderer? 
-	-	&gt;It wasn't the fall that killed him, it was the landing.
-	-	Opening up a ton of McDs and Burger Kings would have gone a lot farther to westernize those countries, truth be told. 
-	-	&gt;Haji  really?
-	-	Hatred? Last I checked the hatred was concentrated on dictators who run their countries to the ground, not us.
-	-	probably at least 3 or 4 times now.
0	3	You know they are counting the people that the terrorists and insurgents are killing in reprisal.  Also does not consider the number of people who were dying on a daily basis during the Saddam era (do you think he'd let this whole 'Arab Spring' thing just slide by?).   
1	6	Sometimes numbers are wrong.  What's your point, that it doesn't matter that tons of civilians are killed if we don't know exactly how many?  Are you saying America has done no harm to the people of Iraq?
-	-	It's the same method they use to count the dead after natural disasters and other such events.
1	4	&gt; It's an outlier in comparison to most studies done on Iraqi war casualties.  That's not exactly true.  The only other peer-reviewed study with a reasonably good methodology that was done on the subject was [*Violence-Related Mortality in Iraq from 2002 to 2006*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1056%2FNEJMsa0707782), which was based on the Iraq Family Health Survey.  The other "studies" you're talking about aren't actual studies on the subject, but estimates arrived at either through fundamentally flawed methodologies or through studies focusing on entirely different subjects.  Unfortunately, the Iraq Family Health Survey suffers from a number of fundamental flaws as well. One such flaw is that it used government-affiliated interviewers to gather data, leading to a high chance of biased reports, primarily from families who either opposed the government themselves or whose deceased family members opposed the government. Other major flaws include the fact that some 10% of planned samples were not taken due to safety concerns, and an inability to interview those families in the planned sample that had dissolved or fled due to violence.  That's not to say that the two Lancet studies were perfect - they definitely weren't, if only because gathering data in a war-torn country tends to be hard. But they were at least on par with the Iraq Family Health Survey, and a good argument can be made that they were better. However, one thing to keep in mind is that the relevant result wasn't the estimate, but the 95% confidence interval. For the 2006 study, this was 392,979 to 942,636 - a rather wide range.
-	-	Oh I don't deny such things may happen. Though I would deny any idea of you having expert knowledge of every single case. Unless you are some sort of wizard which would be awesome.  
1	6	I was surprised and depressed by the civillian casualties.  So many people who were just trying to live their lives have been killed because of these wars.
-	-	is it not 17 millions per person? Hollywood hit men are grossly underpaid 
1	4	The funny thing is how we (Serbia) are constantly blamed as a nation for committing horrible war atrocities in the 90s (which we did). We arrested Ratko Mladic, dubbed war criminal and genocidal man who killed several thousand muslim men, yet former and current US president are free despite the fact that they are directly responsible for many, many more deaths. 
-	-	hrm... the lancet study from five years ago put the number at 650,000.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancet_surveys_of_Iraq_War_casualties
1	6	Quarter of a million human beings dead, and for what? What have we gained? A hatred throughout the middle east?  Statist pigs.
1	4	I'm so glad I pay for murder.
1	6	I mean....how does this really surprise anyone? Wars cost money, wars kill people. The magnitude is actually lower than I figured it would be. Seriously, if you want some statistics that will make your head spin, look up Operation Barbarossa from WWII. My God.
1	4	Wait, just yesterday it was a million. Wow! 750,000 people resurrected in a day thanks to the power of Reddit!  I remember when the sanctions on Iraq killed a million children. Just how many people are there in Iraq, and how many times has each of them been killed by American atrocities?
0	2	Don't forget, they hate us for our "freedom"  
0	1	This is so fucked up, we should be killing people more efficiently.
-	-	Yes, because the US military never does house to house searches and even if they did, everyone loves an armed stranger with an automatic weapon in their living room.  You have quite an issue with denial sir.
-	-	You have quite the imagination sir.
-	-	[3 days ago no love. :-(](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/29/us-war-costs-3-trillion_n_886879.html). Have an upvote as it's an important message to spread.
-	-	crazy thing is... The war costs 4.4 trillion to our government, which we pay for as tax payers BUT someone makes 4.4 Trillion....   Hummmmmmmm
-	-	We should have opened up a lot of fast food franchises and called it a day. 
-	-	The overwhelming majority of civilians killed were by Iraqis of different religions. People on reddit always take the death toll and blame American death squads.  America did destabilize Iraq, but it the sectarian civil war is what killed most people. You remember the daily suicide bombings killing hundreds of people right?
-	-	Let us not forget that the bulk of the Iraq casualties are the result of haji-on-haji fire. The U.S. is not directly responsible for the sectarian violence. As soon as Saddam died, leaving a void of power, the country would descend into civil war anyways.
-	-	Pretty difficult for a  bomb to save lives, no matter how smart.     ( unless of course the payload is bananas )
-	-	The Lancet Study was a sample poll specifically made to affect US elections.  It was funded by George Soros.  Meanwhile it is over 7 times higher than other sample polls done at the time, and actual counting.  This is what is called a statistical outlier.  But enjoy your propaganda.  I'm sure 9 out of 10 dead bodies at that time in the war were being buried in unmarked graves in the desert without anyone noticing.  It's just so plausible.  FYI 225,000 is far more than enough to scream bloody mass murder, no need to discredit the argument with propaganda.
-	-	The Lancet Study has come under heavy criticism from a number of prominent statisticians and academics. It's an outlier in comparison to most studies done on Iraqi war casualties. But of course, this is reddit. And confirmation bias is okay provided it's against the war.
-	-	And the Lancet study was done before the worst year of violence began, mid-2006/mid-2007.  
0	2	The number may even be higher. During the bombing period of the invasion a lot of infrastructure was destroyed and much of the paper records have been lost.   These estimates of civilian casualties rely on reported deaths , that is people whose identity could be confirmed and were actually reported to hospitals and medics. Those that cannot be recognized are often left in a limbo of non-existence or if the description fits called enemy combatants. Also a great deal of deaths go unreported.   During the bombing campaing the estimates may have also been a lot higher as not a whole lot is left in the aftermath of a 1 or 2 ton bomb, those bombs leave craters the size of city blocks. Whatever gets hit by it gets pulverized.  The Army and government use those conservative estimates mostly to tune down the severity of the conflict but as it turn out reality has a darker hue. 
-	-	Try walking around Egypt, Iraq or Afghanistan with a US flag T-shirt.   In Europe you'll get sneers. Egypt, stones throw at you. I've not been to the others.  
-	-	Actually both. The Western leaders are screw-ups and corrupted in their own way.
-	-	We didn't actually give Osama bin-Laden guns and money, although I'm sure he ended up getting his hands on some of it. He was an independent operator, with his own source of funds.
0	1	Well maybe if we hadn't been giving Osama guns and money to kill soviets in the first place, that mother fucker wouldn't have been able to turn on us later.  Its gonna be the same Story in Libya. We are helping the "rebels" and they will turn out to be the same kind of "rebel" Osama was.   The U.S. has military bases all over the planet and many people don't want us there.  How would you like it if a soldier with an automatic weapon who didn't even speak your language kicked in the door of your home, put you and your children on the floor at gunpoint and then looked through your wifes panty drawer for guns?  I assume you would want to buy them a beer?
-	-	That's right, everyone in the middle east is a goat herder who wants to murder us...
0	2	Alright, you seem to infer a lot about my political beliefs based on very little. I admit that I'm a little jaded because I've been hearing similar statistics at various points over the last decade. They are absolutely appalling, and do not deserve to be so casually brushed off as I just did. Don't misunderstand me- I detest the Bush Administration with every fiber of my being for their decisions with regards to Iraq ALONE, not to mention every single blunder which surrounded it and all the fallout thereafter.   I apologize for not really thinking my post through very well, and offending you in the process. I genuinely agree with you, and I am not being sarcastic in the slightest bit.  In return, however, I would ask that you refrain from making uninformed and clearly anger-driven assessments of other people which you have no evidence to support. Indirectly claiming the person you are arguing against is a sociopath does not convince them of anything- it simply makes them more inclined to argue with you for the sake of arguing. Its a shame when someone makes a good point which is completely lost on its audience because they *want* to disagree.  Sidebar: I don't exactly know what you expected to add with your last couple sentences. I said "My God," for emphasis, and I think most people would get that given the context.
1	6	Why are we in Iraq? When did American involvement in Iraq start? Be specific.
0	2	Yeah, thats why these goat herders keep trying to blow stuff up in our cities. Because they hate their leaders.

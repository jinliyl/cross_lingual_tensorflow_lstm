-	-	Sudan invaded Libya and now holds over a 100,000 square miles of Libyan oil territory.  It's all about oil and always has been. Same shit different US president. Can you people be that dumb to believe all that  NATO bombing was about "democracy"?  Jesus f'n christ....duped again. 
-	-	I'd be giving the rebels nothing.   In the late 1970's when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, the United States gave all kinds of weapons and equipment to assist the 'resistance'... nearly 30 years later, my how the tables turned. They are now fighting that resistance... 
-	-	Libya has oil, so if and when they take the country they will be able to get pretty much anything they want regardless. Gadaffi has a significant air force, mechanized ground forces, and until recently an active nuclear weapons program.  
-	-	Um... Credibility?   Watch this: http://www.obamaslibya.com/ They are vid's of the "Rebels". WARNING:   These will be the most horrific vids you have ever seen in your life.
-	-	I think they aught to let things be and let it all self regulate. Libya risks becoming another Afghanistan in years to come. Except this time more accessible and less reliant of neighbouring countries.
-	-	Agreed on that, if there was oil in North Korea then we would have invaded long ago. In time oil will become a secondary energy and its value will one day fall. Until that day Governments will secretly fight for it.
0	2	We are facing the same problem in Libya as Afghanistan. We have a government in power that we know is repressive and will support international terrorism. We have a force trying to overthrow it that is marginally capable of running the country and will probably not be on our side when the dust settles. Help either side and we're going to be hated and reviled. Do nothing and we're going to be hated and reviled. 
-	-	Right, because we bombed Kosovo for the oil?
-	-	Do nothing and you do the right thing - it's none of our business.

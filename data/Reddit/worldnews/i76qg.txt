0	3	That's narrow minded in the extreme. There's a little more at stake here. 
-	-	[You are so right, that would totally "fix" the music industry.](http://www.joeydevilla.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/home_taping_is_killing_music.gif)
1	4	I'm actually FOR this!  I mean, I'll gladly start paying for music/movies instead of pirating them, if it means that online credit card fraud, child pornography, and the rest of unlawful activity are potentially stopped.   Does your privacy mean SO much to you that you wouldn't stop potential victims of crime, being victimized at all?!?!?  All the gov't would learn from my internet usage, is that I visit reddit far too often, and that I like internet porn. Fill your boots.   
-	-	Det er måske på tide med en lille debat om organiseringens lyksageligheder over i /r/Denmark? Nu er det kraftædemig snart lige stramt nok det her.  Edit: De [er allerede i gang](http://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/i76qo/forslag_du_m%C3%A5_ikke_l%C3%A6ngere_g%C3%A5_anonymt_p%C3%A5_nettet/).
1	4	And the police has also admitted they don't use all the EU mandated data that is logged about Internet traffic either. So this is just an example of bureaucrats being assholes. More interesting is that there is a good chance this is against EU privacy laws already and the Human Rights convention.
-	-	Working on it
-	-	And Danish musicians get KODA money they have nothing to worry about. In DK it's the writers, painters/sculptors and the like who are often the starving artists.
1	6	I'm saying that I was unable to find the "Politiken" article. I checked the page again and I still can't find it... If you see it, could you please link to it?
1	6	Of course the police want to ID you to use the net. They want ID on everything you do. They want to know what dead trees you read, what you buy, who you talk to, what you say, what (il)legal meds you take and more. NO is the only answer.
0	2	....shit.
-	-	Under the guise of anti-terrorist rationalizations.  Same with libraries then?  No prepaid cell phones right? No fuck you. Come on Danes - dont let this happen.
0	2	I had hoped this wasn't true, so I bought today's printed Politiken, and it's all in there. The headline translated: "Suggestion: All use of the internet will be registered".  The Politiken article includes a lot of critique aimed at the suggestion, and the one from computerworld is just a shortened version of it, sans the "expert opinions". Here's an example of the criticism (translated to the best of my abilities): "We have become democratically lazy, and do not imagine that this kind of of data can be misused. But of course it can. It's an unnecessary and effect-less intrusion in people's privacy. The ones who this means to stop, will find another way. The terrorists will always be one step ahead." I hope this shit doesn't make it past this so called "working group". It's very upsetting that our politicians are willing to sell out on people's privacy for the sake of fighting an illusory threat. On top of that, the danish police seem to be doing alright stopping terrorism without having to keep tabs on all our citizens. Idiots.
-	-	There is more to this than police wanting an easy life, this is because of a fundamental problem underneath.    The state always needed the possibility to enforce its laws; otherwise there would be no point in having them.  Now the internet is shifting a lot of things out of reach for the usual means of the state, and what we witness here and in countless other instances is the state trying to regain the power of prosecution it had a few years before.  This is not (only) because the state is all power hungry, mind you; it has the duty to enforce laws and to assure the means to do so, to a degree.  The problem of course is that private life and public action is so intimately interwoven in internet traffic that such brute force methods would mostly do more harm than good.    This will need a lot of shaping and balancing of privacy and defense of rights -- or a drastic shift in our perception on what the state should and should not try to enforce.  I think this is a fine example of society being three steps behind technology development.  It might take a generation or two to properly cope socially and legally with the internet.  
1	6	I didn't know Denmark suffers so much from terrorism.
1	6	This certainly sounds serious, but I've looked around and haven't been able to find any other sources for this: Google shows one other article which seems to be a word-for-word copy of this one; I don't subscribe to Politiken, so I don't know if it was in the print version for today and hasn't been put online yet (It's not on their site at any rate) and it's not on the ministry of justice's [site](http://www.justitsministeriet.dk) either.  My hunch is therefore that these are rumours/speculations which have been exaggerated. At any rate, until I see another source, I'm very skeptical. 
0	2	WHAT?  Ah, it's a recommendation by a working group under the justice department. The current set of Danish politicians - both in government and opposition - may be incompetents, but they ought to barely recognise a political suicide when they see one. If not, they can be made to learn what one *looked* like.  And if that isn't enough we'll see the bastards in the streets. And my axe.
1	4	Yeah good luck with that.
-	-	I'm going out to get some food and I will buy today's Politiken on my way home, to see if this is real or not. I'll post again when I get back.
-	-	...very factual article with many references and links.
-	-	They keep saying this, like the authorities cannot ID you already (without a lot of work on your part, re: Lulzsec) the desire is for you to ID yourself.
-	-	Don't you have a login and pass already?
0	5	This is disappointing.
-	-	Sounds like you need a Tor Bridge™.
-	-	I guess Denmark just got bumped a notch, the Netherlands takes the lead
-	-	The title doesn't really fit the article. The article clearly says this applies to open connections like those found in libraries and cafes.
-	-	Sounds like you need a Tor Bridge™.
1	4	Perfect, musicians might get to eat finally.
0	1	I'm danish, and FUCK EVERYTHING about that
-	-	Can't find anything on politikien.dk either, but JP/EPN's got it [here](http://epn.dk/teknologi2/computer/sikkerhed/article2470929.ece).

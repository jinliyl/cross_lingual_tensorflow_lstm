1	4	Type 2 diabetic here, former fat bastard. I went from 140 kg to 105 so far, and I did it nice and slow over 3 years. I've gone from taking pills twice a day to three or four times a week and my blood sugar has stabilised. As tempted as I am with the idea of ditching the condition for good, I don't think I could survive on 600 calories a day without wanting to bite the head off a passing vegan.

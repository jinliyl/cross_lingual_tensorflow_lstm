0	1	I don't know about driving or medical care, but saying they lack in weapons proficiency is BS. I've spent 3 months with volunteer forces in my country, to give you a perspective, the volunteer army is SHITTIER than their conscript counterparts. Everything from training to equipment. We probably went through maybe 200-250 rounds (maybe less) each, with shitty M70 rifles (AK variants) and people could still hit moving targets at reasonable distances consistently.  I can't believe that a professionally army would have trouble with weapon proficiency. I simply refuse to.

0	5	From conquering France to not even being able to use their weapons properly. What a sad decline.
-	-	Now for a different perspective.   I was in the US Army, stationed in Germany, and cross-trained on occasion with German and UK forces. After basic training was over, I fired my weapon for 100 rounds (50 practice, 50 to qualify) once a year.   Even the front-line infantry guys only shot that much. Only special ops guys regularly fired small arms in training. From discussions, things were similar in UK and German forces.  Troops about to combat-deploy should get extra work up time, including range time, but I don't know if the Germans do that or not.  Either way, range proficiency doesn't translate to the real world. As an example, none of the qualifying courses used when I was in required any shooting up or down hill.   When you are under stress (like being shot at) all the things you have running through your head on the range (stock tight, but not too tight, gentle forearm grip, breathe easy, both eyes, sight picture, then breathe in and hold for final sight acquisition, squuueeeze that trigger) have to be rote actions and muscle memory, because your conscious mind is too busy trying to pay attention to the entire situation.  And firearms proficiency isn't just shooting. It's taking care of your weapon in a hostile environment much different than one you are used to being in. (Which is why the world has so many AK variants, which hold up better to being under maintained in crappy conditions)

-	-	Maybe their goal is to have a stable currency and economy that isn't quite so impacted by the neighbors' fuckheaditude and financial asshattery?
0	2	I'm from Germany and this is just bullshit. Germany gave up the D-Mark for the Euro and is the strongest supporter of the whole One-Europe idea. But it does not work if Germany pays for all the mistakes and mismanagement of some EU members. So what's the solution, pay until the whole EU goes down or find ways to reorganize the "bad apples"? 
-	-	Here we go again...
0	2	Yep, every time that the Germans act in their own interests, or try to prevent others from ripping them off, they are Nazis. You heard it here first. 
-	-	Leopards... ...spots and all that, eh. 
-	-	They should bury the euro, it's a badly designed basked case. I don't see what it would have to do with "German hegemony" though.
-	-	Again with the "über alles" bullhockey.  C'mon, Germany, this is getting old.
0	2	This is such a hilariously retarded conspiracy theory, it should reach Reddit's top spot in no time   With the first 300 comments defending it feverishly and calling every one that disagrees a nazi, of course.

0	2	I agree, this article is bullshit. The cover of *Der Spiegel* is, as all magazines do, an exaggeration of a topic. The arcticle is written very subjective and gives very few actual sources, except its own interpretation of the article in *Der Spiegel*  &gt;The fact is that the Germans wanted to put an end to the “nightmare” of countries that are unable to help them along their imperial path.  Wow... just wow...  Care to explain, were that "fact" is coming from?  The end of the article is almost hate mongering against Germany.

-	-	&gt;Is China right for trying to bully its way into taking the South Seas?  You mean the South China Sea?   Anyway,  &gt;Part III, Section 2, Article 40 UN Convention on Laws of Sea “During transit passage, foreign ships, including marine scientific research and hydrographic survey ships, may not carry out any research or survey activities without the prior authorization of the States bordering straits.”  The Philippines and Vietnam have long claimed areas in the Spratleys, along with China; which claims the fewest of the three. The Philippines has been searching for oil and doing survey work without seeking authorization from China, which China in the past has not objected to, but has now decided to assert that right. China has also offered to have three-party research and survey missions, and have three-party mediation.   I'm sure it's a great opportunity for the US to make it's weapons industry pay a few more dividends and donate to politicians re-election campaigns, but it will be worked out without bloodshed. All three countries are way too inter-dependent to be goaded into a 'hot' conflict.  As far as the US 'making friends' in countries bordering China, I don't imagine many people in the Philippines want to become US-friends like Afghanistan, Iraq, or Vietnam was in the past. 
-	-	Before 9/11 the Bush Administration set it's targets on China. They were going to be the "new enemy" of America in a sense, because while past presidents had made good relations with China, under Bush the United States took the opposite path. Arms deals were made with countries surrounding China and for the first time in history, the U.S. agreed to a deal that would give Taiwan diesel-powered submarines. China began to panic. Of course, 9/11 happened, and reversed most of the negative feelings toward China. The United States now had a new, real enemy to fight, and China was not considered anymore, but with Bin Laden dead, the Chinese believe we will once again find a new enemy in them.
-	-	It's not quite that simple. The Chinese as well as the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia. Taiwan and Brunei all have disputing claims over a chain of mostly uninhabited islands that basically would extend anyone's EEZ throughout the South China Sea.  
0	1	Well, you are clearly forgetting that aggressive military expansionism is okay as long as you are not a western nation. God, what is it with people and not **always** blaming the United States. Don't they like, read books and stuff?
-	-	You mean the fight against the USA?
-	-	Someone should arm Al Qaeda and Cuba.
0	1	Wow... somebody has no fucking sense of humour
-	-	&gt; 1) creating pressure, 2) "making friends"  Right, China's stupid and doesn't do anything back yes?  Many of the comments here suggest a world politics in which the US is free to somehow sneak these kinds of things up on China as though the country is completely unaware of its own options in this.    China has already begun to have contacts with many nations that may be distrustful of American hegemony.  Out of the BRIC nations, the US may count, at best, India, to be a possible ally.  The rest of these countries all have extensive ties to China, and the emergence of these countries on the world scene is going to be significant in the long run.  Additionally, China's massive foreign reserves are now being directed at purchasing European debt, which makes China's cooperation for global stability all the more significant and which detracts from criticism that may come from traditional US allies.  Ultimately, what is happening isn't going to be settled by an issue of "right" or "wrong", but whether or not the assets of a nation might be secured.  We view things in the sense of morals because, living in a first world nation with access to an abundance of resources, there is no immediate exigency vis-a-vis where our next gallon of gas will come from, or when our next food shipment will be.   Yet I would have to say, without a doubt, that US policy would be *extremely* different regarding securing energy assets if Saudi Arabia and Canada either didn't do business with the US or didn't have stores of oil available to it.  In this alternate reality, where rolling blackouts might still be frequent even in post-industrial America as they are in industrializing China, the idea of securing oil supplies from, say, Cuba or even Brazil, may suddenly become attractive options.    Regarding the Spratleys, the same mentality is prevailing with China.  This isn't a case like Canada or Saudi Arabia where the oil is simply going to be exported anyways because of lack of domestic demand; China is surrounded by energy hungry nations that are all too eager to take those assets in the Spratleys for their own purposes.  If you were a Chinese policy maker facing the prospect of China's growth being impeded by lack of access to energy, I imagine your course of action wouldn't be too far from what China is doing right now.  Conversely, in a Vietnamese or Filipino situation room, the same belief can be rationalized.
0	1	I fucking lol'd.
-	-	This particular issue is quite simple. The currently disputed islands are clearly Filipino territory based on treaties the Chinese have already agreed to. There is a UN treaty that China itself even signed that they are violating here. China signed this treaty I believe back in the early 80s when they weren't as powerful as they are now. They are clinging to some document from the 1940s to claim the ENTIRE South China Sea as theirs.
1	4	lol.  there is no way we can properly outfit the AFP without spending a ridiculous amount of money considering most of their stuff is equipment we gave/sold them from the korean and vietam era wars.  I saw their airforce practice with f51 mustangs and I have pulled out KIA's out of huey helicopters after a gun fight with the ASG.  This is ridiculous.
-	-	didnt the Philippines have the same status that PR has at one point in time (US proto-state)?
0	2	Just routine cock-waiving between China and a U.S. vassal.  Neither one of them is dumb enough to set off a naval conflict.  Well, I hope not anyway.
1	8	The Philippines navy is very poorly outfitted, and not a match to the Chinese by any measure, they would be squashed in any confrontation. The US probably won't be able to supply them with any significant firepower.
-	-	I smell cash, only.
1	6	Nothing will come of it, we are too tied economically with China and we can't handle them militarily. (I mean we aren't going to march to the capital and put up stupid mission accomplished banners.)
-	-	It's high time ASEAN becomes a NATO of East Asia, except this time to deal with China. All of these guys combined (population, economy, military) can't even punch at China's weight so they need to pool resources and form a military alliance.  Imagine if France, UK, West Germany had to deal with the USSR on their own during the Cold War. They wouldn't last a decade.  "We must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately." - Benjamin Franklin
-	-	We've been supporting the Philippines for years... like 60 or so. They've been fighting the Abu Sayyaf, which is the Filipino branch of Al Qaeda.  Also, we should give them whatever they need to keep the Chinese on the mainland.
-	-	So they'll have the right to Panda-bear arms?
-	-	[deleted]
1	6	I think the U.S. should definitely provide military aid to everyone around China. Possibly provide them with terrorist training like the Al Qaeda predecessor in Afghanistan, they were great at fighting the Soviet Union back then. :)
0	2	Arming a foreign country to fight a proxy war; that policy never backfires. . . cough. . . Iraq. . . cough. . . Afghanistan. . .  cough.
1	6	For all the tens of billions in aid taiwan has received, military planners in the west have calculated that it would withstand a chinese assault for about 2 -3 days at best, maybe only 24 hours before it was occupied..  IN the case of phillipines, lol. This is a naval scenario and phillipines will never even have a hope in hell. It's piss poor, and us is broke, military aid is just to buy some influence in their regime.  Two million filipinos were slaughtered by the US during it's occupation of the country after they took over from the spanish.
0	2	Why would china want to invade the philippines?  Don't they have enough backwards peasants and ugly women already?  I mean, when the best your country has to offer is a bunch of malls, its time to just pack it in and admit defeat. 
0	2	There's a reason why the U.S. is arming up people around China. Forget about going in yourself, if you give arms to those neighbouring China, you're 1) creating pressure, 2) "making friends", and 3) ensuring that you have some reach into the area by being the main arms provider. This whole thing is a bit murky...is the U.S. right for arming these countries? Is China right for trying to bully its way into taking the South Seas? Both are probably no, but international politics is a cruel mistress. 
0	2	Yeah back in the 1930s. We used to have some huge military bases there until the 1990s. A volcano, Filipino nationalism, and disgust over US military patronage of local prostitutes were all factors in the closing of the last US bases there! 
1	4	The U.S. should attribute 2 trillion dollars to outfit Philippines with a military that can withstand China. I think that's a great idea.
-	-	The ASG isn't so much the filipino branch of Al Qaeda as they are seperatists.  In reality, they're more of thugs and fund raise through drug trafficking, extortion and kidnapping.    &lt;---former special forces support soldier deployed twice to southern philippines.
0	2	I'm sure people will see the US as the bad guys again for helping to enforce a UN resolution, just like what happened with Iraq. Did you know that China is trying to claim the entire South China Sea despite having even signed a UN treaty defining a nation's territory as extending 200 miles from its shores? The bastards are trying to build oil wells on Filipino territory! 
0	2	The US essentially does that with Japan and Korea already anyways.  The notion that it can afford to completely revamp the military of the Philippines, which still relies on remittances from overseas Filipinos as a principal means of attracting foreign money.  Its sovereign public debt is already pretty high at 75%.  In short, the US would essentially be paying for that country's military entirely, which is simply unfeasible.  
-	-	I'm not sure which treaty you're talking about. The Chinese (and Taiwanese) claim to the Spratly's is that they historically had a maritime presence there for roughly 2000 years. This is an iffy claim because a maritime presence doesn't carry the same weight as an official claim of sovereignty.  The Philippines claim is based on the legal principle of _Res Nullius_ basically the idea of that which has been abandoned can be claimed by whoever gets there first, more simply "finders keepers". At the end of WW2, Japan had to relinquish the islands as part of the peace treaty. At that point the French were making no moves to reclaim them. The Chinese and Vietnamese were making moves towards them at around the same time as the Philippines.  TL;DR: Power vacuum in the Islands after WW2. Several countries occupied different parts of them with legal claims the others reject.
-	-	&gt;what is it with people and not always blaming the United States  America happens to be the only country at war most of the time, while dragging its cronies along.
0	2	Well I suppose I'll have to wait and see what the result is here. I think I recall that The Economist's view was that China is picking on a weak neighbor to try to take something that isn't rightfully theirs. 
-	-	Depends. If there's another nation's coastline that conflicts with the 200 mile eez, in other words less than 400 miles away, the procedure is to split the territorial waters between the two as equally as possible. That's why everyone is attempting to get the most complete claim on the island chain as possible.
0	2	I think that the reefs in question are within 200 miles of the Palawan coastline. Am I wrong about the locations of the reefs or are the Chinese now disputing that Palawan's not a Philippine territory? 
1	8	I'm well aware of the UNCLS, but most of that deals with distance from coastlines. When said coastlines are in dispute (in this case the islands) the potential exclusive economic zones of the countries involved vary wildly.  
0	2	http://www.gmanews.tv/story/223862/nation/phl-pushes-rule-of-law-in-west-philippine-sea-at-un-meet  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea  You're trying too hard. No need to go back 2,000 years when there's a treaty from less than 30 years ago that the Peoples Republic of China signed. The land in question here is within 200 miles of Filipino coastline and is, by the very standards that China recently agreed to adhere to, Filipino territory.

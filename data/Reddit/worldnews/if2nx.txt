1	4	Actually, Israel isn't a signatory of the fourth Geneva convention (but it's probably jus cogens anyway) - however it does not forbid collective punishment it forbids punishing civilians instead of the military. In the wars of today where there's a hazy line between who's a soldier and who's a civilian (and they all dress alike) the Geneva convention isn't an easy thing to follow. There's is a distinction since humanitarian aid gets trough and military aid doesn't. Goldstone at least claims Israel did not attempt to harm civilians, see his article it the post from earlier this year.   There's also a question about the type of punishment. You can't impose criminal like punishments, and you can't argue a blockade is a criminal like punishment. You can impose a navy blockade of any state you're at war with, unless you control their territory - the division of Israel controlling the air and water of Gaza follows the Oslo accords, but Hamas controls the actual territory.
1	4	While I may not agree with any political motivations behind the ban on allowing the flottilla/ship to leave port, it is in fact illegal to leave port without the proper authorization, and there's a good chance leaving port requires having a port pilot on board to safely comply with local regulations.  Additionally, that ship is NOT equipped/designed to safely transport 100 people and supplies.  Now it may have had less on board, but ships capsize from being poorly loaded entirely too often.    When a ship leaves port they have to have file paperwork that states its exact loading conditions, and has to state that these conditions are within the ships safe design conditions.  Additionally, approval is required.  Allowing ships to leave port without being safely loaded, or without a port pilot to safely maneuver through a congested port is dangerous.  Had the Greek gov't allowed the ship to do leave, and it had capsized, we would be reading an article about how the Greek Gov't allowed the deaths of ~100 people, instead of how it brought them safely back to port.  Again, I don't agree with holding a ship in port for political reasons, and while that may be the case here...it is also possible that the ship was unsafe.  And, for the record, a ship leaving port without the approval of the port, is similar to an airplane taking off from JFK without air traffic controls approval.  It could end so poorly it's not worth doing. 
1	4	There are various reports by Human Rights Organizations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Physicians for Human Rights that have also come to the conclusion that Israel deliberately targets civilians.  So it's not just the UN.
-	-	imho, there is a difference between militants and civilians.
0	5	This is the list of items that are not permitted.  the post you cited is either incorrect or a lie. His sources are all outdated. At the end of June 2010 Israel significantly eased the blockade. His sources are all from before that.  This is the actual list of Items banned from Gaza.  http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/HumanitarianAid/Palestinians/Lists_Controlled_Entry_Items_4-Jul-2010.htm  Johnfpublics list is outdated, truly sad to see reddit cluelessly upvoting it.
1	8	I'm sorry, but the fact that Israel delivers cloths does not contradict the claim that cloths are banned? Here is a claim made by that post:  "At one time all of the following was either outright banned or restricted by Israel"  Here is what is actually said in the link provided for the post:  "crayons, stationary, soccer balls, and musical instruments have been, at times, banned for import"  It then goes on to say that other reports claim they are not banned. So how is it not a contradiction when the article used claims almost exactly the opposite of what the poster is claiming?  If you go even further you will see that the list of materials is based on what many Palestinian business men deem is being banned. Now I am sure many items are banned, but this list used is no way official. All one needs to do is claim that they were not allowed to have something shipped and it's on the list. It doesn't require any kind of proof for the reason. But somehow you already decided it was banned without even bothering to research the links. The reason for that is the real issue at hand.
-	-	Economic warfare is always collective punishment, by definition. The U.S. does it Cuba, the world does it to Iran, but when Israel does it to Gaza it's bad. You're a moron.
1	4	That's funny because the UN supervised the cargo from the last flotilla group. And when you say the UN, I think you mean certain parties in the UN? The reason it's hard to deliver construction material is because Hamas keeps taking that material and using it for military purposes. If Hamas would stop making its goal to attack Israel, they wouldn't have to put restrictions on building material.   As for your request I did a google search and came up with hundreds of links to examples. The biggest one as mentioned was the last flotilla which everyone was up in arms about, so here is one of the 100s of result pages:  http://www.humanistnewswire.com/2010/06/irin-middle-east-israel-opt-flotilla.html
0	3	Or if you ask Israel, ALL Palestinians are terrorists. See, not targeting civilians.   ;-) U Mad?
-	-	ummmm... source? proof? as far as everyone knows, israelis never fired missiles into civilian centers for the purpose of killing swaths of people. nor have they blown up car bombs or explosive vests on crowded busses. nor have they broken into houses and murdered adults and babies with a knife
1	4	Yea really.  Why should only one side be armed? Why should the israelis be able to shoot palestinians like fish in a barrel?
-	-	yarly
-	-	I would be for disarming both sides.  The question is why are you for arming only one side?
1	6	Yeah. Really. Why?
-	-	Jews aren't infidels, they're People of the Book.
1	4	&gt;The fact of the matter is that Israel provides more humanitarian aid to gaza than anyone else.  That's like a farmer feeding his animals.  Israel feeds the palestinians which they view as their animals who are kept in small corrals in order to keep them alive.  The point is to make their palestinians dependent on them and only them for their very survival.    if they allowed just anybody to deliver goods into gaza the people of gaza might eat foods israel does not want them to eat and might not be dependent on israel for their lives.  Israel can't live with that possibility. The Palestinians must be dependent on them for their very lives. 
-	-	So basically you have decided that there can be no peace so there's no need to even try.  How exactly do you see this ending?
-	-	Israel also doesn't want muslims on this land. Kinda goes both ways, except the Israelis live in better conditions and have guaranteed rights.   Not exactly sure how this issue fits in with socialism.
-	-	No, Israel is creating the very hatred they then have to defend themselves against.
-	-	&gt; I mean, instead of saying they want to do it again on 50% of their websites.  I think... you might be completely delusional?
1	4	It's a protest. You know like the protests in Syria and Bahrain.  Like Syria and Bahrain, Israel shoots at protestors and kills some of them.
-	-	I personally downvoted him because he is incorrect about why things are banned.  I encourage you to read what Israel has banned from the Gaza strip in this post:  http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/if2nx/greece_arrests_captain_of_us_gazabound_boat_over/c2396cy
-	-	thought this was mideastpeace  you don't do peace while firing at each other.  if anything you should call for the disarming of all parties: Hammas, PA and israel. 
-	-	That's completely untrue. Please back that claim up with something. The part about anything on that list not being allowed in is not only not in that PDF, but it is contradicted by the supplies that Israel brings in, most of which are not on that list.   If they wanted to ease suffering, they would simply bring the aid into the ports where they can then get to the Palestinians. They refuse to do so. If they wanted to bring aid, they would bring at least more than what Israel brings themselves to Gaza in a single day. The fact of the matter is that Israel provides more humanitarian aid to gaza than anyone else.   The fact of the matter is you are lying. You literally made up the claim that anything not on a list of some items that got through to Gaza is not allowed. Shame on you. 
-	-	They have stated their intentions are to commit a crime. 
1	6	&gt;Why should only one side of this conflict be armed?  really?
0	1	israel is doing what it needs to defend itself   good thing for greece for being level headed, a lot of blood could have been spilled violating a naval blockade. this shit happened last year, fuckwits never learn
-	-	&gt;Or, you know, Israel could try and make peace so that so that people wouldn't want to fire missiles at them.  The terms set by both Israel and the Quartet for the normalization of relations:  1) Renounce violence.  2) Recognize Israel.  3) Abide by existing agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.  I mean, if the international community has so much authority to order Israel around, why no authority to order Hamas around?
1	8	Hamas and organizations like it don't believe infidels have the right to live on any land that Muslims conquered at any point in history.   They'll never be content with just Palestine. It's just a cute rallying cry to garner sympathy from the Starbucks socialists. 
-	-	Or you know, Muslims can acknowledge their huge role in the Holocaust finally and we won't be so afraid of them??? I mean, instead of saying they want to do it again on 50% of their websites.
1	4	Because it's not true. This claim comes from an article that was reporting a temporary incident during a conflict. What they're trying to do is make you think that Israel has a policy on not allowing water or water purification systems when Israel in fact has been helping Gaza develop such systems. Right now they are working on pipelines between Israel and Gaza so they can help treat the waste while providing extra clean water. But that article being from 2009 wouldn't mention that. Nor does the poster mention the conflict at the time that was the center of the actual issue. All that is mentioned is Israel denies water purification. Is that very honest? What kind of crime is it to leave out important information in an attempt to mislead readers?  Sorta like how in March this year a flotilla full of weapons and missiles was stopped by the Israeli Naval blockade. But no one seems to have any problem with that.   I just really REALLY wish people would actually read the articles they are using for these claims. I wish they would follow the links to the very sources. Anyone can do this. You go to the article, you click on it's source, follow it's source, until you get to the original story.  And that's just assuming the direct article the poster read is being dishonest and leaving this information out as if they are getting it from a reputable news source, such information would have been included.   Should it not be important to note that Gaza now has treatment plants? They did just before that article was published too, but the battle at that time between Hamas and Israel damaged a lot of the piping.   Just to put things in perspective. In the 1st quarter of 2010, just before the big Flotilla incident Israel delivered 94,500 tons of supplies to Gaza. Including:  60 billion gallons of purified water 40,000 tons of wheat 2,760 tons of rice 1,987 tons of clothes and footwear 553 tons of milk powder and baby food 11,000 head of cattle into Gaza 4,883 tons of medical equipment and medicine  That's just in one 3 month period. The Flotilla that everyone loves to talk about brought a couple of tons of expired medical supplies.   http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/About+the+Ministry/Behind+the+Headlines/Israeli_humanitarian_lifeline_Gaza_25-May-2010.htm 
-	-	&gt;Israel won that territory fair and square in the six day war.  Israel does not claim ownership or gaza or the west bank.  You knew that right?
0	3	1) In the 6 day war Isreal was not attacked or invaded.  2) The Palestinian people were not one of the potential aggressors  3) Countries don't usually keep the land they gain in a defensive war, France didn't keep part of Germany, now if you want to model yourselves after the USSR then it does make more sense.  4) If you are going to talk about how many innocent Israelis have died (about 1,084 since September 2000) you should consider the 6,430 Palestinians, in fact more Palestinian children have died 1,463 than all Israelis put together. I'd also debate the no reason  5) It is important to remember that Zionist terrorism was used to help found Israel (for reference 996 innocent Brits died)  6) It should be noted that the only claim Jews have to Palestine is from a fictional book
1	4	&gt;they get to keep that piece of land.   Yes, in the 1800s, that was true. Two world wars later the human race realized that this wasn't such a bright idea, and it is very much illegal under international law to annex land by use of force.  &gt;To stop the missiles coming into the territory, they blockaded it.   So that's why pasta and musical instruments were banned from being imported? Too much risk of penne bombs being dropped on Israel? Or maybe flying guitars?  &gt; Put any other country's name in place of Israel's, like say the United States, and imagine what would happen?  Please. The United States has consistently been criticised for its foreign policy and for its involvement in several wars.   &gt;Don't you think that the U.S. would pulverize and "shock and awe" anybody who did that to them?  How would that make it right? Collective punishment is wrong no matter what the circumstances.  &gt;If you want to talk about warcrimes, how about you talk about how many innocent Israelis have had to die for no reason?  When Israel invaded Gaza in 2008, killing 1,400 people the majority of whom were civilians, around **10** had died in the span of 8 years as a result of rocket fire.
-	-	&gt; If you want to talk about warcrimes, how about you talk about how many innocent Israelis have had to die for no reason?  Put up a list of dead and injured Israeli civilians vs. dead and injured  Palestinian civilians over the past 20 years. It should be easy information to find.
-	-	Actually everything east of the Jordan river was designated to the Jews after WWI. The surrounding Arab population didn't agree with only getting 75% of Palestine so they attacked. 
-	-	The UN still considers it occupied territory. Or does the opinion of the body that created Israel not matter?
1	4	Yes.       Would you like some intellectual assistance in working out why it is still considered to be occupied? I have my explanations ready if the task is too much for you.
-	-	It's just hermetically sealed.
-	-	Do you believe in Santa Claus, by any chance?
1	6	It's also based on a single humanitarian group. That doesn't make the claims of that group wrong, but it's just the take of a single group who is known for being on one side. Their intention is to do everything they can to paint Israel in the worst light and Gaza in the best. And what aggregation? They don't explain any requirements for what goes on their list. All one has to do is be a Palestinian businessman who says they were not allowed to get an item. If one guy couldn't get some chocolate, it's on the list and now we can claim that Israel bans chocolate.   I am sure many of the claims on their list are legitimate and I wouldn't dismiss them simply because they have a bias, but at the same time, I cannot conclude that Israel bands all of these things using just their criteria. Especially when some of them have been demonstrated to be incorrect.    A major part of the problem is that Hamas does anything it can to launch attacks on Israel and as a result the innocent people have to suffer. Many items have dual uses and if it can be used for building weapons (many foods can be) then Hamas does it. All they have to do is stop attacking. Israel has made steps towards a peaceful goal such as easing up the restrictions when some of them were pointed out to be completely uneeded. They gave back Gaza because they agrees that it no longer qualifies as a buffer zone once you start building on it. They even gave all the buildings in tact to the Palestinians. What did Hamas do? It destroyed all of the infrastructure the Jews built in Gaza because it was built by Jews. So they destroyed that infrastructure, and now have to depend more on Israel. But to many here that's Israel's fault...
-	-	How is it "the most accurate" It is completely inaccurate. His "list" is all (deliberately) from before the blockade was eased.
1	4	So parts are counted as exports, and completed machines are exports, but not machines that are *almost* assembled from parts?    &gt; Personal experience.  The internet likes citations. Otherwise, the internet might think you're full of shit.
-	-	Nice one sociopath
1	4	He spent 20 years of his life in the US, it is a well known fact. You can call me a conspiracy theory for as much as you like but I am absolutely convinced that he likes the US/Israel alliance. In the case, he did not exactly commit treason, but he did took sides. In my opinion, Greece should probably remain neutral, as other countries around try to do.
0	1	I've actually upvoted you on all accounts for your efforts to commit yourself to a reasonable debate, which unfortunately for you, you are not bound to have with me. This is simply due to me being ~~bored~~ stupid and lacking facts off the top of my head to use as arguments. I have an opinion, which is comprised of my own personal experiences. My esteemed opinion of the USA is that it is a country full of loud mouthed buffoons who actually believe their cool-aid of being the greatest nation on the world. US capitalist foreign policies towards the third world are those of an imperialist vasall state economy that will tolerate genocide abroad, as long as it serves your own interests.I hate the bipartisan political system filled with constituents who are loud mouthed morons, appeasing loud mouthed morons while lining their pockets with corporate money. I hate feeling unsafe in the US. I hate the lack of culture and the way you abuse your poor. I hate your penal system... even though I am not a criminal. The USA was founded on some great principles which are today being abused and anyone who questions the course of action is quickly labled un-american. I fucking hate so much about the US but at the same time I love a lot as well. But if me hating on stupid loud mouthed americans can make them think about "why they no like us?" for just a second, I've had some small impact. Americans like to go parade around how great they are when most of them are poorly educated with a very narrow insight into world politics and happenings. This is not a matter of jealousy. Its pity. I'm from central Europe and have lived in the US as well.
-	-	I found the data elsewhere. It's 7.3%. See graph in here.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14003788
-	-	That said, if you're barely able to service your debt and someone calls in 6% of the principal...
0	2	It's a universal thing really, everyone hates Jews. Wonder why that is, because you're such glorious people? Or because you're the scum of the earth?  Stealing other people's land is definitely a move only Jewish character could stand behind. I applaud your shameless exhibition of zealotry and ignorance.   Turkey will wipe the floor with you should it come to blows; compare Turks' military history with Jewish. Oh wait, you've only been a country (if squatting qualifies for such an equivalence) for the last 50 years, you have no history. 
0	1	Don't get angry mate - it's just a simple conversation. Think of it this way, there is absolutely nothing you can do to stop us from boycotting Israel.  We do it because it works. If it did not work, you (and people like you) wouldn't be so fretful of the idea. I believe **anonymous-coward** already deflated part of your argument about the Israeli economy.  You're starting to bore me, so whatever you say next, make sure it worthy of a response.
1	4	Missles from Iran is the propaganda they tell you while trying to divide, demoralize and destroy the will of the Palestinians. You can try to create a nanny state to watch over the Palestinians to prevent them gaining arms, but you'll never stop them from getting around the blockade.  The flotillas are a spearhead of international goodwill to the Palestinians and their plight. The world supports them having basic rights. No group of people should be collectively punished. The way to increased safety and protection from rockets is to make peace with the Palestinians not confining them like a bunch of dangerous animals. And How do you make peace? Start by freezing the settlement (well you might need to get rid of Netanyahu) The world is at a time with many right wing governments in control, its easy to let fear guide us and dehumanize the people we fear. But we must recognize this for what it is. These hardliners aren't going to solve these problems, at best they'll keep the status quo.  
1	6	The patriots of '76 *hid among civilians*. What are they supposed to do, gather in an open field with targets on their backs?
1	6	&gt;These boats are not there to deliver humanitarian aid, they are there to violate a naval blockade...  Of course its not about delivering humanitarian aid. It's about the only effective weapon the Palestinians have, publicity. Its gets people asking:  Why is Israel Blockading Gaza?   Why is Israel so brutal?           From that that a question a whole host of awkward questions flow.         Why do the Palestinians fire rockets?    Why is malnutrition rife in Gaza?   What are the Palestinians upset about?   Why has this dragged on for 40+ years.    Whats Israel doing in the West Bank?           The flotilla is a legitimate way to garner publicity for their cause and raising awareness of the issues. This is what Israel fears, the worlds attention turning on the question of what Israel is doing to the Palestinians
-	-	I agree with you, the Israelis are extremely humane. They even allow lentils and pasta into Gaza since 2009, after the last flotilla. They even provide the Gaza inmates with minimum calories so they don't starve. I personally would nominate them for Amnesty's International humanitarian award.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_allowed/banned_for_import_into_Gaza  Comparing that to Warsaw would be unjust. The Germans never had a permitted foods list.  http://www.gisha.org/UserFiles/File/publications/Products060610_Eng%281%29.pdf
-	-	the blockade has been declared illegal by all international bodies, let alone inhumane (collective punishment of 1.5 million people). But I guess it's Israelis who are the concentration camp wardens now so we can't criticize them.
-	-	Israel has received hundreds of tons of missiles and weapons from the U.S. Are the Palestinians justified in trying to stop those shipments by any means possible?
-	-	It's an illegal blockade of an occupied territory. That's a warcrime, by definition.
0	1	Or, you know, Israel could try and *make peace* so that so that people wouldn't want to fire missiles at them.  Your argument is basically that you've locked someone in a room, and you are angry that people come and try to give him food without letting you inspect it, because someone might give him a gun that he'll shoot you with, and wouldn't it be much worse if you had to shoot him now to defend yourself.
-	-	The flotilla aims to do both. Deliver aid and break the blockade.  Last year the flotilla was vindicated, as Israeli restrictions on harmless items had to be loosened once the nature of the blockade was revealed.  I don't believe Israel gives any aid to the Palestinians, it merely allows the aid in.  Blocking these boats is also a publicity stunt, in the same way as breaking the blockade is.
0	1	Israels blockade is fucking atrocious - I deal with a company that tried to deliver a machine designed to clean water using solar / UV technology for the kids in gaza as part of a charity, and the Israelis blocked it. fucking stopping kids having access to clean water.. why aren´t the locals seeing common sense and seeing what they are doing? We have seen in the past what happens when you stand back and don´t step up and pressure the govnt....
1	8	I don't know what Israel is trying to do by flexing it muscles irrationally in this way. All it is doing is breeding more distrust and more hatred toward the people of Israel. I have nothing against Jews and I have nothing against the citizens of Israel. I know they are just people like every other people in the world and I try to defend them against unjust attacks that are made against them all over the internet. But my sympathy is wearing thin and I'm starting to feel inclined to join the growing uproar that is turning against everything Israeli. I look and see how they are waging battle against the most hungry most poor most destitute and I'm sorry but my empathy for the people of Israel has pretty much run out. It's time for Jews to overthrow the Zionists. 
-	-	Its a conspiracy! 
0	1	This is all due to Israel, and has absolutely nothing to do with the actual boats seaworthiness or endangering the passengers, because the freedom flottila is infallible and has no flaws. We all know that. It's because they're against Israel and for Palestine, so it's clear!  Evil jews at work again, I'm sure...  *sigh*  Fucking reddit.
0	1	Good. Fuck the Palies
1	4	Looks like Zeus is the more powerful god. Sucks to find out you wasted your life on the wrong religion. 
-	-	So at what point in their economic failure can we stop considering Greece a sort-of relevant nation?
-	-	PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, CAN WE JUST NUKE BOTH ALREADY AND BE DONE WITH IT.
1	4	Talk about piling on unrelated charges. It's not like they had enough legal footing to stop the sailors anyway.  Waiting on the second Turkish flotilla to head for Gaza, escorted by Turkish naval ships. We'll see what's going to happen then.
-	-	Germans,try to stop em´ 
-	-	Morale. Morale is low, not moral.
0	1	Please take your sock-puppeting elsewhere.  Gaza is clearly collective punishment of people A who are angry at people B about being systematically deprived of a homeland by people B.  People B have more force and have oppressive discriminatory practices, and have been perpetrating injustice for 40+ years.  Thousands of years of history of co-deprivation to the peoples who share this rock are irrelevant to current evil.
0	3	Yes, but it's quite curious how hard they're "going at it", like the captain is a wanted murderer or *terrorist*.
-	-	They did this in preparation, before any boarding. Seriously will people go watch it and educate themselves? The counter to Fox news bias isn't bias of the other side.
-	-	There are dozens of UN resolutions against Israel, and they fit to fail to comply with any of them. Except of course the resolution that created the country
0	2	A very small, specific group of Jewish sinners from the time of Moses. Do you think any of them are still alive today?  What about Matthew 7:6?  Look, just be open about it: you hate muslims. Don't try to rationalize it.
0	1	&gt;because the palestinians are waging war, not israel, dumbfuck,  Israel does not recognize this as a war.   &gt;unilateral actions of israel have probably saved hundreds of thousands of palestinian lives.  You mean they didn't kill as many people as they could have.  I wonder if that would work in murder trials.   See officer, I could have killed a dozen people but I only killed one so I am the good guy!   
-	-	Actually, Christians have been much worse towards Jews than Muslims have been, historically.  Most of the current anger Muslims feel towards Israel is due to the Palestinian situation. Remove that, and you've just solved most of the issue.
1	4	There are always exceptions.  Just like there are Palestinians who know co-existance with Israel is the only way to go. 
-	-	Well, no.
1	4	And this is a good reason to act like asses and make everyone even angrier, somehow?
1	6	What is Israel supposed to do?   Stop driving a wedge between Jews and the rest of humanity. There's no such thing as a Jewish *state*, anymore than a Mohican, Left-handed or Gay *state*.
-	-	they can stop and inspect ships if they want to and then let them continue if there's nothing on board.   However, *nothing* justifies banning food items, nothing justifies banning fishermen from fishing, nothing justifies banning exports, nothing justifies a death zone inside the strip. Does that  makes sense to you or are we on a different level?
-	-	It's not just the EU, it includes the IMF aswell...  Not to mention Greece owes America money directly aswell.
-	-	Last time I checked, it's "its" (not once, but twice), and who said blockades are illegal?
-	-	[Indirectly](http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/we_re_bailing_out_greece_NzQZTSIOLgxboJ6yyOWOpM)
-	-	Because everything bad is the US.
0	3	Failed policy? The security fence and the Gaza blockade have substantially reduced the number of terror attacks, and accordingly, the number of dead Israelis. It did what numerous negotiation efforts could not. In the long term there may be sustainability issues. But, from an Israeli perspective, you'd have a hard time making a case that the policy is failed. And since it is they who set policy, appealing to them rather than parroting the hivemind soundbyte is what you need to do if you care about change, not just comment karma.
0	1	It's like this, my foreign friend:  America is #1.  You being a foreigner are our personal fucking dog.  Our corrupt fucking politicians send your shit incompetent government our hard earned tax dollars every month so why don't you do us all a favor and shut your whore fucking mouth.  The American Tax Paying Citizen owns your bitch ass.....so kindly do us all a favor and go fuck your whore fucking mother up her asshole.  If you get out of line, and piss off Corporate America, our military will be sent to your country to *"bring teh peace and democracies"* &lt;&lt;snicker&gt;&gt; to your people.  Fucking piece of shit foreigner.  I as an American Tax payer own your fucking bitch ass.     So now I command you to sing for me.  I will stalk you on Reddit until your bitch ass fucking SINGS for my American amusement.  **SING ME A MOTHERFUCKING SONG YOU STUPID FUCKING SAVAGE!!!**

1	4	I'm not an Arab but I'd expect just this attitude from an ignorant Jew like yourself.
-	-	But see, that law applies only against the enemies of US and Israel...
-	-	Thought Greece was broke.
1	4	The purpose of the flotilla is to make a political statement. They are pointing out that the people of Gaza are suffering a collective punishment........a crime against humanity. They are being punished for democratically electing in Hamas.   Without very brave (fearless in my eyes as there is a very good chance that the brave brave israeli navy may shoot them dead) people like the flotilla organisers and the participants we would hear next to nothing about Gaza and the crimes that occur there on a daily basis. They are protesting peacefully against a brutal regime........Gaza and the treatment of the Palestinians is the world's shame. If you are one of these people that supports Israeli actions against the people of Gaza you should hang your head in shame.   The way that you paint Israel as the victim and the people of Gaza as the aggressors is breathtaking.
1	4	Wow, "Gaza is a prison, you can visit the prisoners but you will have to do it through the warden"...  Everybody should watch this - this is Israel's foremost history professor explaining Israel's policy in the territories:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufLAitMq3zI&amp;t=33m53s

1	4	not sure if /s or wow...
0	1	&gt; you really should read up on the flottila incident and how Israel was not the instigator or bad guy in that situation.  http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/04/gaza-flotilla-activists-autopsy-results    &gt;  A 19-year-old, named as Fulkan Dogan, who also has US citizenship, was shot five times from less that 45cm, in the face, in the back of the head, twice in the leg and once in the back. Two other men were shot four times, and five of the victims were shot either in the back of the head or in the back, said Yalcin Buyuk, vice-chairman of the council of forensic medicine.  The forensics are pretty ugly.  &gt; How the fuck can you people be so brainwashed by liberal media!?!?  Cobra8472 ... *FAIR AND BALANCED!* 
-	-	...Or maybe the fact they left port without permission and broke greek law.  buy keep gong with your conspiracy theory that has no merit at all other than what you think happens in washington and the political scene with no evidence or background. 
1	6	Why is that?
-	-	Can you verify that everything delivered to Ashdod will actually make it to the palestinians? From earlier reddit discussions on the topic, I understand some pretty insane stuff gets held back.   Edit: Actually there's data here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_allowed/banned_for_import_into_Gaza#List_of_items       I would support many of those items on the list reaching... well, any human that needs them. 
1	4	Israel's blockage is to keep Gaza at the brink of economic collapse:  http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/05/israel-planned-to-keep-gazas-economy-on-the-brink-of-collapse-leaked-cable-says/  You can claim it is about Iranian missiles but it is a about a lot more if you read the facts.  Here is a list of all banned items:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_allowed/banned_for_import_into_Gaza#List_of_items  At one time all of the following was either outright banned or restricted by Israel:  - books, candles, crayons, clothing, cups, cutlery, crockery, electric appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines, glasses, light bulbs, matches, musical instruments, needles, sheets, blankets, shoes, mattresses, spare machine and car parts, and threads  - fishing ropes and rods, ginger and chocolate, hatcheries and spare parts for hatcheries  -  Batteries for hearing aids have been restricted.[16] Wheelchairs, at various times, have been banned.  - cement, glass, steel, bitumen, wood, paint, doors, plastic pipes, metal pipes, metal reinforcement rods, aggregate, generators, high voltage cables and wooden telegraph poles are high priority reconstruction materials currently with no or highly limited entry into Gaza through official crossings  Israel's blockage is collective punishment unfortunately.  David Cameron, the current PM of UK says that Gaza is an open prison camp.  http://www.juancole.com/2010/07/cameron-calls-gaza-under-israel-blockade-a-prison-camp.html  You can defend putting one million people into a prison camp and denying basic goods.  But realize this is what you are doing.  These people have been living under these conditions for years.   Remember the main issue is that Israel has +3.5 M non-Jews in Gaza and the West Bank which is doesn't want to have as citizens (because it will threaten the Jewishness of Israel), but it also doesn't want them to have their own state either (thus pushing hard to prevent the UN vote for this in September.)  Thus Israel is running an apartheid system where millions of humans who are the wrong religion are denied the right to self-determination. 
1	4	Yes, they were so trigger-happy that they did absolutely nothing since the ships hadn't sailed yet.
0	1	&gt; Israel is imposing their "shit fanatical religion" on the "entire world"  Haha, *wow*...all I can say is if the average American is as dumb as you then America is royally fucked.  
-	-	&gt; The greek really do have a corrupt politician assigned to absolutely everything imaginable.   Exactly. And when we protest against those politicians, the reddit hivemind is quick to judge that Greeks are lazy and only care about tax evasion.
1	4	Aside from the fact that you've proffered zero evidence of Israelis seizing Palestinian-bound goods except as related to security considerations (like weapons), your point is absurd. After all, even if true, some of the aid would eventually reach the Palestinians. But, with a stunt like this, where next to no aid is on board, and you sail knowing that it cannot be delivered, you help nobody. 
1	6	*What?* You do realize you're just making up stupid conspiracy theories to fit into your delusional narrative right? Please show me evidence of Israelis stealing aid from convoys going into Gaza.
0	2	&gt;Israelis will take whatever they need or want from the load   Proof. Now. 
0	2	He said that Israeli corporations have American daughter companies. Whatever they make (mainly telco stuff), is labeled as "Made in the USA" and is not covered by the statistics you cite.
-	-	Really? Thats what your reading comp skills have deduced from, if i do say so myself, my very well argued retort?  But, yes. I stalk you all.
-	-	I dont play "video games" you moron.
-	-	No. It won't. Israel has been boycotted by one place or another since it's inception, it's doing just fine.
1	4	&gt; On June 24, an anonymous complaint was filed against the ship's "seaworthiness". The Israel Law Centre (Shurat HaDin), took responsibility for the complaint in the Israeli media.   It's funny.  The Israelis seem to vacillate between a profound concern for the health are welfare of the activists, and shooting them in the head.
1	4	**"You have, do, and will continue to buy Israeli products."**  You sound like a stalker.
0	1	Glad to see you are sufficiently concerned to post the above paragraph. Good. If you can avoid it - dont buy israeli. Simple. Fuck them.
-	-	Well we all know how kindly the Chinese treat their people.  .... shit.
-	-	&gt;  The Israeli economy is not based on name brand commercial products, but rather hitech industries that you use, and buy, unbeknownst to you.  Israeli exports to USA are based on diamond cutting and jewelry first.  High tech is 2nd.  [Link](http://www.suite101.com/content/top-israeli-imports-exports-a59994)  1. Gem diamonds … US$9.5 billion – up 10.5% from 2006 (**45.6%** of Israel-to-U.S. exports)  2. Dental, medical and pharmaceutical preparations … $2.7 billion – up 3.5% (12.9%)  3. Telecommunications equipment … $746.8 million – up 17.6% (3.6%)      
-	-	Downvoted for telling the truth
-	-	They'd probably not get any publicity or aid if they did
-	-	Apparently there are a lot of essential items that are not allowed: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_allowed/banned_for_import_into_Gaza#List_of_items
-	-	I'd love to see the guy stop playing video games, which hardware is largely based on Israeli technology.
-	-	&gt;We've discussed this so many times, monsieur jackal. The Israeli economy is not based on name brand commercial products, but rather hitech industries that you use, and buy, unbeknownst to you.  No but a boycott will still have a measurable effect and so will divestment.  
-	-	You really think Greece had a choice in the matter you sheep?

1	8	Sorry Mr.Hindsight but for one that was not racially motivated, it was monetarily motivated. Admittidly there should have been support, so to in the Holocaust but that's over now too. Our fellow humans need our help, regardless of the 'publicity stunts'. What's going on is very much real.
-	-	why are you being downvoted!
-	-	When you use the phrases "most people in the world" and "most people" please be more careful about what you are saying. It is absurd to use these phrases when all you really mean is Western (or probably just US) republicans.  If poor people in China and Africa have no idea about what Gaza is, then they probably have issues of their own to worry about and it isn't really an Israeli conspiracy.  I am not disagreeing with what I would guess your position on the matter is, but just urging you to have a bit of perspective.
-	-	Go up and read what malcontent has written.
-	-	Yes. Also they can prevent you from rolling your debt over by not buying new securities (technically).
1	4	And I was promptly downvoted, the posts have been upvoted a bit now, but not much.  Meanwhile, Johnfpublics lying post was mindlessly upvoted.  And as for your assertion that most people (on this subreddit) are "generally good" note the upvoting of antisemitic statements, that occurs regularly on r/worldnews.  *Collective punishment is immoral and illegal under international law.*  *Sure the jewish religion and culture sees nothing wrong with it* - (17 upvotes, 10 downvotes)  I made a post about it on r/shitredditsays which brought some downvotes, before that it was at 9/2.  I've spent a bunch of time on r/worldnews. Many of the people posting and upvoting in these threads are out pushing a racist (not just antisemitic) agenda. It's the same on r/politics and r/worldpolitics
-	-	Because Jews didn't cause it.
-	-	Because it doesn't serve their agenda.  Reddit is somehow mesmerized by Palestinians and how the evil jews are suppressing the sooo peaceful people of Palestine.
1	4	seriously, it's one thing to sympathize with the Palestinian cause, but if you support any of the actions of the "humanitarian" flotilla: you are either terribly misinformed or retardedly gullible.  Thanks, jonnyclueless, for providing this discussion with some facts and a rational perspective, reddit often gets too caught up in tonguing it's own collective asshole.
1	4	I do. But taking sides like this does not sound very moral to me.
0	1	What the fuck are you on about?
0	2	Sure everyone hates Jews; there's always a stereotype attached to Jews in every culture that has encountered them; greedy, filthy  Then you should stop bitching about Jerusalem being your own promised land.  Time will tell who's going to kick your ass, either the Turks or the someone else. I will be watching from the sidelines and laughing at you. 
-	-	Our government will do anything to favor the west.
0	1	Sigh. My tax dollars hard at work....first off to perpetuate the terrorism myth, second of all for israel to further fuck with their neighbors. So they can take their shit fanatical religion and impose it upon the entire world.  God Bless America, Happy 4th everyone, USA #1!!!
-	-	Well, they wanted the glory of being arrested by a commando unit, they got it.
-	-	well done greece, well done. 
-	-	Goverment corruption in Greece? Inconceivable!
-	-	Worst socialist party ever.
-	-	You know, this so called peace movement is starting to get on my nerves.    They continually draw attention upon THEMSELVES rather than the Palestinians.  Everybody and their mother knows that Israel isn't going to let the Flotilla go through, why do this instead of setting up massive sit-ins at border crossings or organizing Palestinians into peaceful protests?  Even setting up workshops to teach them about Ghandi and MLKJr.    There are ports blocking aide, then setup protests to the aide at the site.  If that aide is not delivered then set up a webcam to show the people of the world that the Aide is not getting through.   
1	4	It's like that time when that "unsinkable" "ship" hit that "iceberg".
0	2	First the irish came through, and now the greek, thank you, the hate mongering flotilla needs to stop, islamofascism is real
1	4	It kinda sounds like they wanna mess with tex.
-	-	I missed that clothes is contradicted, you are right. I also notice that johnfpublic states that items on his list are "at one time".    The reliability of the claims of Palestinian businesspeople would depend on whether they are singular or aggregate claims. I would trust claims by a government authority over singular claims, and I would trust aggregate claims over claims by a government authority. 
1	4	Sounds like you are clueless, Jonny
1	4	I don't think the upvotes are clueless per-se. So far the list Johnofpublic provided was the most accurate. Now your list is (possibly) more accurate and certainly more recent. Note that it comes from a single -government- source. It would still be interesting to see an aggregate survey to see what actually comes through, on the ground.   The list of things that are not allowed into Gaza indeed appears to have dropped somewhat.   There is still a lot of equipment that is not allowed into Gaza, however. It seems difficult to operate a viable economy there. (Deriving from the list of goods [incl. wassenaar]: construction, mining, farming, industry, IT are all restricted. )
1	6	Or a Muslim state (Saudia Arabia, Iran, and countless others). Why exactly do the Muslims get to claim their own states but not the Jews?
-	-	&gt;There's no such thing as a Jewish state  The Israeli Declaration of Independence says otherwise.
1	4	apparently there is unfortunately and the result is what you see on the evening news...   A racially/religiously oriented colonial supremacist state will always be at war with its neighbors. Once it becomes a state of all its citizens, its troubles will end and Jews, Christians and Muslims will be able to live once again in peace in the Holy Land like they did for hundreds of years.
-	-	&gt;they can stop and inspect ships if they want to and then let them continue if there's nothing on board.  The boat in question is refusing to stop for inspection.  That's the whole deal here.  EDIT- A downvote in the first 14 seconds.  Impressive.  Am I wrong?  Is the boat volunteering to stop?  Or am I just being insufficiently critical of Israel?  
-	-	According to the Economist, only 6% or something of Greece's debt is held by the US. It's mostly held by France and Germany.
-	-	Right. Based on that source alone, it could well be one of the few times where the UN supervised supplies entering Gaza. Certainly, the newspaper found it newsworthy to mention that the UN was doing so. Can you find other instances?
1	4	&gt; That's funny because the UN supervised the cargo from the last flotilla group.  Would that be the flotilla group that had nine of its members murdered by the Israelis, one of them a teen-aged American?  As I recall, two IDF soldiers were disarmed, held captive by flotilla members and let go alive after their compadres murdered the nine. It's pretty easy to see who the peacemakers are, eh what?
1	4	You can keep calling it bigotry all you like, but you'll still be full of shit.
0	1	because the palestinians are waging war, not israel, dumbfuck, unilateral actions of israel have probably saved hundreds of thousands of palestinian lives.
-	-	[deleted]
0	3	If this is based on some "zionist," agenda, why do the Egyptians fear terrorism equally and maintain the other checkpoint ...AND specifically bar the terrorist govt of Gaza from crossing when now..no one else is barred by Egypt, even under the revolution.
0	2	Jews have been hated since day one and as long as their cultural identity continues to exist the Muslim world will always want them dead. 
-	-	You realize there's Muslims not only in the Israeli armed forces but in their special operations units right?
-	-	I'm arming the side I'm ON. choosing sides is also something one can do.
-	-	Too bad the Koran compares Jews to monkeys.
-	-	actually if it is a us corp paying isralelis it would have an effect on imports.    that 9 billion in diamond exports is just a gross dollar number.  there are no diamond mines in israel that i know of.  there are mineral royalties to be paid to landowners / govts where the mines are, there are the actual costs of mining, etc, etc.  from the link:  Gem diamonds … US$4.9 billion – up 20.6% from 2006 (37.5% of Israeli imports from America)  so over half of those gem diamonds are coming from the us to be sold by israel elsewhere.

1	4	WTF are you talking about? Seriously, I have no idea.  The boycott is a joke, as is clear by the statistics of Israel's booming economy and next to nil unemployment numbers. All i am saying, is that i find it funny how gullible people are, and how self important they feel when they say retarded idiotic and naive statements with such conviction.  Like you for example.

0	1	&gt; So they can take their shit fanatical religion and impose it upon the entire world.   *The fuck??!* What are you even talking about??? 
1	6	Why is Israel Blockading Gaza? Because Hamas uses ships to have Missiles and weapons delivered from Iran and use them to attack Israeli civilians. Hamas doesn't hide this fact and they state it in their charter.  Why is Israel so brutal? That's subjective, but the reason is because Israel is under constant attack and the only way to prevent the violence to them from reaching the same levels it once was is to prevent the attackers from ever getting close enough to be able to do so. It used to be that Israel was being attacked from every neighboring country. And this was before the disputes that are now being used as a justification for Hamas attacks.  Why do the Palestinians fire rockets? Hamas has stated that it's goal is to eliminate Israel. Even long before Hamas came about this was still often the case. Do you remember the "Drive the Jews into the sea" campaign? Originally everything east of the Jordan was designated to the Jews and everything west to the Arabs, giving the Arabs 75% of what was then Palestine. But this wasn't good enough so they attacked the Jews. This was long before any of the current disputes, so maybe you should ask why did they do that?   Why is malnutrition rife in Gaza? Because Gaza's government spends all of its resources on trying to attack Israel instead of building its infrastructure. When Gaza was given back, Israel left large infrastructures in tact for the people to use. Hamas destroyed it all because it was built by Jews.   What are the Palestinians upset about? They are the only ones with legitimate gripes. They are victims caught in a war being lead by Hamas.   Why has this dragged on for 40+ years. Because it's based on religion and so long as people follow these religions, that will take priority over the good of the people. Hamas doesn't simply want to exterminate Jews because they are diabolical. They believe they are doing the will of their god and trying to get back their holy land for their god.   Whats Israel doing in the West Bank? This is an area that I don't agree with Israel on. However to be fair, this land was originally designated to them, not the Palestnians. It was taken from them by Syria and technically belonged to Syria not Palestine (which isn't a country). Originally when Israel was attacked again they used the land as a buffer zone to protect them from the ongoing attacks. Having that buffer made it harder for Syria to attack them. However building on it negates that use which is where I disagree with them.  Palestinians would get all the publicity they need if they would stop supporting Hamas. They would get more humanitarian aid than anyone in the world if it were not for Hamas. But because they choose a government who's goal is war, most aid provided to them would just be used for attacking another group of people. Israel doesn't fear attention going to Palestinians. Israel would love for Palestine to have everything Israel has. But so long as they choose war, Israel has no choice but to protect itself.
-	-	but the aid does get through.  Before the flotilla ships were boarded and 9 "civilians" were killed, they were told by israelis repeatedly that the aid could be checked and brought to gaza once they were proven to be clear of weapons.  These crews don't give a shit about getting aid to gaza, they just want another Israeli PR screw up.  If they did care about the aide, they could ship it all to ashdod, haiffa, or even egypt.
-	-	That was a movie, silly.
-	-	Israel is the worst thing that happened to Jews since the Holy Coast.
-	-	Violating a blockade with an unknown cargo and challenging the sovereignty of a foreign country... How is that peaceful? 
-	-	they want israel to end the blockade of Palestine.
1	6	What will happen is that Turkish ships will return home with their tails between their legs.
1	4	The Greeks deciding that a ship is not seaworthy?  Wow, never thought I'd see the day.  (context: grew up in a family that was heavily involved in oil shipping and got moved around a lot thanks to good ol' Royal Dutch...)
-	-	Actually, a number of the Israeli naval commandos had pistols in their thigh-holsters from the get-go.
-	-	Last I checked, (it's been a while,mind you) the blockade was illegal.  And I should point out that the USSR was moving it's own property from itself to one of it's allies. We illegally blockaded that ally, which is, in fact, an act of war, and it was most certainly instigating. That the USSR chose not to respond is immaterial.
-	-	bbbut they are the chosen people.
1	6	But Greece is being bailed out by the EU. Why does the US matter that much to them right now?
-	-	Butthurt Arab is butthurt.
-	-	it not going to happen as long as israel continues their 30 year long failed policy.
-	-	They were still in international waters, no blockade was broken.
-	-	A blockade itself is an act of war.  The US was instigating when they set up a blockade (but called it an embargo so that it wouldn't be considered an act of war). They were playing chicken with the Soviets and the Soviets blinked to avoid escalating the conflict.  During the Berlin Blockade, it was again a game of chicken, where the Americans were certain the Soviets wouldn't shoot down unarmed airplanes breaking the blockade to start a war.  You can't expect a nation 100% economically dependent on another to just take it up the ass forever? I say forever because it's been over 50 years with the ball in Israel's court for peace, and nothing.
-	-	Your citation does not actually say that all items were banned at some point and are now no longer banned. 
-	-	So what is Israel supposed to do when Iran actually sends weapons to Gaza?  [Washington Post Link](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/israel-intercepts-ship-it-says-carried-iranian-weapons-bound-for-gaza/2011/03/15/AByI6TX_story.html).  If Iran was shipping missiles and RPGs into the port of Miami, would that be ok with you?
-	-	Malcontent isn't the Left, inshallah.
-	-	The left simply does not share your moral values.  We think the occupation is wrong and that it's wrong to deny freedom to millions of people because you think your god promised you some land.
1	4	It's funny how you consider it a war crime when Israel responds to Hamas attacks. Yet you make no such argument about Hamas launching these attacks from Schools, hospitals, and using human shields. A bit of a double standard no? Israel used precision guided weapons to take out strategic military targets that Hamas intentionally put in populated areas, a direct violation of the Geneva convention. But that violation is not an issue to you, Israel trying to stop those attacks is. And what was Hamas's tactic? To blindly fire rockets into civilian populations. They didn't target military, they targeted civilians. Another breach of the Geneva convention.   BTW, the person who wrote the UN report upon reading all of the facts changed his mind and concluded that Israel was NOT guilty of war crimes, but only Hamas was. Of course other members of the UN don't agree with the author, but they also share your position which is that Israel commits war crimes when it takes out military targets that Hamas intentionally puts behind human shields.   I would actually love to see someone come up with a reasonable response Israel should have to the missile attacks. One other than just letting their people get killed.
0	3	secular Palestinian terrorists...
1	4	There was no murder. The militia on the boat attacked the Israeli soldiers. If you recall, several IDF soldiers were shot and stabbed. Several were thrown down decks. The only reason they survived is because they switch to their last resort of using guns. Their biggest mistake was not expecting to have to use force, hence being equipped with flash bangs and rubber bullets. But once it became clear that the militia on board had every intent of violence they had to defend themselves.   Many of them were recorded as saying that they had all intentions of dying as martyrs on that ship. They have stockpiles of weapons. Even as the IDF were repelling down they were beating them to death.   And guess how much humanitarian supplies were on that boat. ZERO. All of that death could have easily been avoided. They could have simply complied and let the cargo get inspected and it would have arrived and no one would have gotten hurt. They could have also followed Israel's suggestion before they left port, which was to deliver the goods through Egypt. But they had no intention of delivering humanitarian supplies. They wanted a fight, they chose to attack, and they are responsible for the deaths. Not the IDF. 
0	1	Right, I meant protocol I. Thank you for noticing that, I fucked up.  What I mean is that Israel controls the borders of Palestine not because of force but because of an international agreement between the representatives of both nations, which is the Oslo peace accords, which states that Israel should control the air above Palestine and the territorial water outside of Gaza. So after that one would argue whether they control the territory of not, and if they don't they could potentially have a sea blockade. From the Hauge convention occupied territory is territory which is under another nations military control. As far as I know there's two problems with this: (1) Gaza, and Palestine as a whole, isn't a recognized nation by most of the worlds nations or by the UN, meaning most international laws doesn't apply. This is why PNA needs to get their shit together and create a state.  (2) You could of course also follow prior international law which states that the entire British mandate of Palestine should be a Jewish state and that Jordan and PNA are occupying Israeli land.  What I meant with being difficult was that the GC was created for another type of warfare.   Goldstone was claimed to be just and fair, and not possible to influence when he agreed with Palestine, but is beeing pressured when he agrees with Israel. Give it a break.  No, it isn't a criminal like punishment, putting them in prisons would be. Searching and denying them the right to make weapons mainly aimed at hurting soft targets however is legal - and I have yet to see any evidence that they restrict anything simply because they are mean. Most of the things are either weapons, or have a dual purpose. Hardly illegal either way.  There's a lot of debate as to whether you can or can't occupy something which isn't a state in itself, which prior international law says is your's. Probably you can't and the UK only had the possibility to modify an agreement within the San Remo agreement and not amend it.  You say they maintain the right to place soldiers in Gaza. Why yes, they do. It's called self-defense and most states agree they have the right to self-defense, even through preemptive strikes (like the US strikes into Pakistani territory, but perhaps Pakistan is occupied...).  Israel probably maintains control over the West Bank, but not Gaza. Not controlling Gaza means the can issue a blockade. Could they excerice authority at will? Maybe, but probably not.  Israel maintains the right to stop delivering electricity when attacked, since a power station would be something they could attack if Palestine had been a state and had attacked them, I believe this to be withing reason. 
	um... ok, what is the lie?  i would love you to submit a source that demonstrated how the IDF ever targeted civilians. otherwise, i'm afraid it's you who is gurgling the kool-aid
	That's not really an official position of the UN. However I would still agree that the UN probably does consider it to be occupied. Mainly because whenever there are disputes, the UN sides with Hamas. The UN constantly criticizes Israel but then fails to hold Hamas to the very same standards. That's the primary reason why the US often refuses to agree to many of these UN treaties. Because they are completely biased. You have one side that makes it policy to use human shields, launch missiles from schools, use hospitals as weapons storage, etc, but the UN has no problem with that. 
	Richard Falk is not the UN and certainly not the **UN Security Council** which is the only body which has any authority or credibility. Richard Falk is an opinion writer for Al Jazeera with a hardon for Isarel.
	&gt; The only thing of importance is Israel will crush the Palestinians. They'll create laws and situations legally or illegally, and keep taking land, legally or illegally, until the Palestinians are no more.  I don't know how you can say this when Israel **pulled their citizens out of Gaza and gave the Sinai back to Egypt for peace**.  &gt;  controls all access to a territory, dictates events within that territory, and reserves the right to intervene militarily.  Also, Israel does not 'control all access' to Gaza. See: Rafah crossing.
	Except for when Egypt opens the border or the huge tunnels where anything/everything gets smuggled.  Hamas has no trouble getting weapons or the stuff to build rockets.  Whether or not what comes through the tunnels should be allowed over a boarder crossing is a moot point because stuff is still getting into Gaza and it disproves your hermetically sealed claim.  If Gaza is a prison it is the worst prison ever invented.
	lol, aka you have jack shit. 
	Yep.  The only way to defend the indefensible is to divert attention or keep it secret.
	this is just retarded.  Israelis don't fire missiles into population centers with the intent to kill civilians.  That is exactly what Hamas is doing from gaza.  If you can't understand the difference, then allah help you
	Since the Gazan government and Israel are at war, the Gazan government can take any action legal under the laws of war to stop Israel obtaining weapons.  That's fine and dandy, but of course the suggestion is not serious since, after all, war crime as a strategy is the only thing keeping Hamas from having to admit their crushing military inferiority.
	No it has not. But please feel free to cite your source. Something also isn't illegal because some people said so, it's illegal because a law was broken. Please show us that law or laws that were broken instead of using rhetoric such as referring to a concentration camp. And also please tell us who is preventing you from criticizing Israel? Has your connection been dropped? Has your account been banned? How exactly is anyone stopping you from criticizing anyone? There's a difference however between criticism and bigoted statements. This is why it's better to stick with facts instead of rhetoric.
	I am sorry, are you saying that Hamas is not attacking Israel? Are you going to claim that Hamas's charter does not call for the extermination of all Israelis? They are not being punished by Israel, they are being punished by Hamas. If Hamas is going to keep attacking Israel, Israel has a right to defend itself. The flotilla people had no concern for the well being of Palestine, they simply wanted to provoke violence. They came armed to the teeth and looking for a fight. You can read the last testimonies of the people that died claiming they wanted to fight and be martyrs.   So the treatment of the Palestinians is a shame. But not because of Israel. Israel doesn't attack the people of Gaza, it attacks Hamas. Hamas however chooses to use human shields, so they get much higher death tolls. Israel on the other hand calls everyone in the Gaza area before an attack so that the civilians have an opportunity to get out of the way. They drop leaflets as well letting them know an attack is coming. They do this because they know that Hamas intentionally uses human shields and the only way to take out these military targets means those civilian shields will get hurt as well. In many cases these human shields are voluntary. There have been cases where after Israel calls and wars of an upcoming attack on a building that 100s of people gather on the roof of that building. But many people here would then claim Israel murdered them.  What is breathtaking to me is how many people make these conclusions but know almost nothing about the issue at hand. So how do they come to their conclusions? Well one party has more deaths than the other and hasn't done as well for themselves so clearly the other party must be wrong. I wish more people would actually research the issue than using appeals to emotion to determine what is going on.
	Yes, the UN supervises this and of course all parties involved can as well. There are items that cannot be delivered and some that have to be done with UN supervision, such as construction material. The link from an earlier discussion uses links that actually claim just the opposite of what that discussion claims. If you find the discussion, click on the wiki article it uses as a source to see, don't take my word for it. 
	Since when is economic warfare illegal?
	Stating it's to cause economic collapse would be easily proven wrong by the fact that Israel delivers almost all of those things. The fact that even the links provided disagree with the claims you copy/pasted should make things pretty clear. Israel does not block crayons, books, candles, chocolate, clothing, etc. They themselves deliver these things. Here is from one of the links you use as a source to claim Israel doesn't allow clothing:  "As of May 2010, they have brought in, according to the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories of the Israel Defense Forces, 1.5 million liters of diesel fuel and gasoline, fruits and vegetables, wheat, sugar, meat, chicken and fish products, dairy products, animal feed, hygiene products, clothing and shoes.[1]"  So I think you may want to reconsider your position knowing that your own links disagree with your claims. 
	If you would read the wiki article more carefully you would find that Israel has lifted the import ban, this means that all of the items that you listed are nit banned anymore.
	Your post is incorrect and your sources are all outdated.  At the end of June 2010 Israel significantly eased the blockade.  This is the actual list of Items banned from Gaza.  http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/HumanitarianAid/Palestinians/Lists_Controlled_Entry_Items_4-Jul-2010.htm  Edit: Would someone who downvoted this care to explain why? Why would you support a link full of outdated and factually wrong information, and then downvote the truth?
	Not sure why you're getting equal downvotes to upvotes... Clean water is a fundamental human right and denying this is a crime against humanity. I admire the charitable company trying to do this.
	Israel won that territory fair and square in the six day war. In any other war in history, when a country wins a piece of land, especially when they're being attacked by multiple invading armies, they get to keep that piece of land. Instead, they gave some of it back to try to play nice, and when they did, they were attacked by those who lived there with missiles. To stop the missiles coming into the territory, they blockaded it. Put any other country's name in place of Israel's, like say the United States, and imagine what would happen? Don't you think that the U.S. would pulverize and "shock and awe" anybody who did that to them? The Israeli reaction is surprisingly controlled and moderate for all that has happened to them. Hamas is a terrorist group whose sole purpose is to destroy Israel, just look it up, it's in their charter. If you want to talk about warcrimes, how about you talk about how many innocent Israelis have had to die for no reason?
	&gt;It's about the only effective weapon the Palestinians have, publicity.  You admit it then: Hamas can't win its own war, so it's trying to cajole the international community into fighting for it.
	So not only did they refuse to let them sail, they *arrested the captain*. This is after two separate acts of sabotage (which Israel consul general Ido Aharoni refused to deny during his Democracy Now interview that he [abruptly ended](http://www.democracynow.org/2011/7/1/israeli_official_condemns_gaza_flotilla_refuses) when they started asking tough questions) and after the passengers were being *held at gunpoint* by the coast guard.  This is US/Israeli pressure at work.  When the Flotilla ships were unable to sail out yesterday I ran a [Twitter search on Γάζα](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%CE%93%CE%AC%CE%B6%CE%B1) and found that lots of Greeks were surprised and disappointed in their government for letting this happen.
	People keep posting this, so I will continue to ask what law has been broken? 
	Hamas, the political entity in charge of Gaza isn't part of any peace process. Instead, they've chosen to shoot missiles at Israel and wage war, hurting their own people in the process, and continuing it because they know the only way they'll keep power is by keeping the people of Gaza under their thumb in a war they could get out of. But then Fatah might take over Gaza, and Hamas would be out. It's self-preservation at its worst.
	Gaza is occupied?
	Gaza isn't occupied
	Hi, you lack context and a timeline. there were missiles and armed resistance before any blockade and before gaza had been occupied (its not anymore). 
	Israel has not locked anyone in any room. The reason for the barriers is to protect against attacks. You are talking about an elected government who's own charter has called for the elimination of Israel and the extermination of the Jews. If it were not for Hama's documented policies there would be no need for these inspections. In fact the blockade did not exist until Hamas took over the government of Gaza. Already several ships full of missiles have been caught, proving that the blockade is needed. Hamas will not be happy until Israel has been destroyed. This is not opinion, this is in their charter. They have documented this as their goal, and demonstrated it with countless attacks and suicide bombings. 
	Dont buy israeli
	Why can't these flotillas ever be put together to deliver actual humanitarian aid? they seem to always just be publicity stunts.   The article even quotes someone who claims this one will be a success even if it doesn't sail. Could they try telling that to the starving children in Gaza to see if they agree?   The politically-motivated publicity stunts are fine, and they should continue. But why not have someone with more than a 7-year-old's organizational skills put together a non-political aid flotilla and send that in? No activists on board. Media is fine to capture anything that may happen, but everyone else is there simply being paid to do a job of delivering aid.
	The flotilla should have used Turkey instead of Greece. 
	Is greece getting any bailout money from Israel?
	[HEALTH AND SAFETY'd](http://www.hrwiki.org/wiki/-d)
	Doesn't Greece have anything fuckin better to do?
	Well fuck Greece then.
	it was leaving without permission, and he was recklessly endangering his crew by sailing into a blockade.  agree with the blockade or not, he is guilty of those crimes. 
	Do the Zionists who arranged this arrest feel no shame?  It is a ship bringing humanitarian aid.....no matter how little.......to a devastated community and they want to block it?  And then they turn around and claim that they treat Gaza responsibly and humanely? These people aren't bringing in bombs or guns.....they're bringing food and medicines and at the same time making a political statement as any free person should be allowed to. But the Zionists cannot have any dissenting views heard........and why? Because they are so palpably, so obviously in the wrong.   Fuck them. Just fuck them all. 
	Yesterday an Irish ship to Gaza was allegedly sabotaged.  Allegedly   http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Irish-flotilla-ship-sabotaged-en-route-to-break-through-the-Israeli-blockade-of-the-Gaza-Strip-124821814.html
	Some Israeli propaganda demands people believe they must deal with their (racist) regime or face financial ruin.   It's a false dilemma.   You suck for supporting such an idea (tho your version was less ugly).  
	But you do browse reddit don't you.
	Oops you done failed
	&gt; Whatever they make (mainly telco stuff), is labeled as "Made in the USA" and is not covered by the statistics you cite.  And what makes you say that partially completed goods are not counted as exports?  Do you have any evidence?
	&gt;Aside from the fact that you've proffered zero evidence of Israelis seizing Palestinian-bound goods except as related to security considerations (like weapons), your point is absurd.  First of all you admit that they do steal personal property as long they claim they are doing it for security purposes.  Secondly I did provide a list on another post.  &gt;After all, even if true, some of the aid would eventually reach the Palestinians.  note the important words in your sentence.  "SOME", "EVENTUALLY".  &gt; But, with a stunt like this, where next to no aid is on board, and you sail knowing that it cannot be delivered, you help nobody.  It's a protest. Like a march on the syrian capital or occupying a square in bahrain.  Like syria and bahrain, israel will shoot at these protesters. 
	&gt;Please show me evidence of Israelis stealing aid from convoys going into Gaza.  Israel stole laptops, video cameras and digital and analog media from the convoy where they killed many people including a young american citizen.  The people who had their property stolen have never gotten it back.
	In that case you should have no problems with a boycott campaign.
	**HEY YOU DUMB FUCKING FOREIGN DOG, THIS IS JUST A NOTICE THAT YOU STILL HAVE NOT SUNG ME A SONG.**
	we were talking about the Mavi Marmara, where [israeli soldiers were attacked by these "peaceful activists"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYjkLUcbJWo&amp;feature=related)   there is only so much verbal pleas and EMP detonation before they need to place soldiers on board to tow the ships to ashdod.
	I can't help but notice how the voting on reddit seems to just be a tool for people to try to silence those they don't agree with. I can't in good conscience down vote a post just because I disagree with it so long as they make a legitimate argument of which there are many good arguments I disagree with in this thread. But the votes don't reflect that. You can see posts along the lines of "You're just smoking crack" get voted up a lot while other posts such as me simply asking which law has been broken get voted down.   It's a shame because the intent of the votes I assume is to increase the quality of the content, but people are using it to lower the quality. I really wish they would do away with that system as I don't see how it can be exacted to be used reasonably.
	I find your post to be very offensive. I am a radical leftist redditor, and I dont want you sticking your ugly facts into my ideology.  I have faith that the turkish flotilla was filled with peace-loving aid workers determined to deliver food and aid to the impoverished palestinians. It is not possible that it was a PR stunt approved by the upper echelons of the Turkish government with the sole intent of embarassing the Israelis. 
	That's up for debate, in that Hamas fires missiles into Israel from Gaza, creating a war-like situation, in which the blockade is legal, but it's never officially been declared a war, so lots of grey. Meanwhile, Israel needs to protect its citizens from getting hit by missiles.
	israel being a dick, how? there is a clear and distinct provocateur in this conflict, and they are palestinians and arabs in general 
	Could you tell us which law is being broken?
	if it were illegal, it would have been challenged and stopped in a world court, but it hasnt.
	what laws are they breaking
	In your opinion, if Greece thinks it is legal why should they not stop the ships?
	&gt; What was factually incorrect in their questioning?  The lady said that an Israeli govt inquiry found that Israel broke the ceasefire that led to the Gaza war of 09.  Then she asked him to tell her why Israel was justified in invading Gaza.  There is so much wrong in that question, it's difficult to know where to begin.  First of all, no Israeli govt inquiry found that Israel broke the ceasefire.  The only thing that the report acknowledged is that Hamas in general kept to the ceasefire right up until the incident which put in motion events that led up to the war.    The incident was that Hamas was digging a tunnel under the border with Israel (ostensibly to kidnap Israeli soldiers).  The Israeli troops discovered this and called in artillery which killed the folks that were digging.    &gt; because HE DIDN'T ANSWER THEM  Correct.  At first he said he didn't know and they persisted.  Then he went off to a different topic and they persisted.  Then he gave a general answer to a completely different question and yet they persisted.  He said he didn't know the first time they asked them.  How many hints do they actually need?
	&gt; Most countries in the world don't consider the blockade to be a legal  Source? 
	Dude you're completely brainwashed are you kidding? Get outside of your simple ZIONIST=BAD narrative and realize that humanitarian aid has absolutely nothing to do with this flotilla. If they wanted to deliver aid they could drop their foodstuffs, etc at the port of Ashdod.   Come on man. Use some fucking logic before you go spouting ignorance.
	International politics isn't like starcraft. You don't have a single person doing all the work. The people who stopped the flotilla probably don't have much in common with the people who are solving the crysis.
	they do, but they are procrastinating because saving their own country from bankruptcy is kinda hard and boring.
	We've discussed this so many times, monsieur jackal. The Israeli economy is not based on name brand commercial products, but rather hitech industries that you use, and buy, unbeknownst to you.   You have, do, and will continue to buy Israeli products.  Oh, and also, innumerable Israeli corporations have American daughter companies that have the finished goods shipped to them from the parent company, with only a few screws unsecured, maybe some labels, and the closing of the box left to be done. Then, we just stick a nice big shiny label that says: "Made in the USA" and sell that shit right to Saudi Arabia, and whoever else plans on boycotting Israel (at a markup of course).  Have fun with your boycott dummies!
	Yes, but keep buying Chinese.. it's cheap.
	they would have a hard time finding starving children in gaza to tell, there is no food shortage and this is confirmed by humanitarian organizations. 
	Nah, just a regular one. 
	dude, this has little to do with zionism.  and honestly, it has nothing to do with aid.  As it has been since the beginning of the naval blockade, all humanitarian aid can be brought to israeli or egyptian ports, searched, and transported to gaza via truck.  They simply do not allow shipments directly to gaza, because it is no longer occupied and thus israel cannot be sure there are no weapons.  The flotilla organizers are aware of israel's position, and proceed to attempt to bypass these security measures in hopes of further israeli PR fiascos. open your eyes.
	I can't help but notice the rating system on here. It's funny to see how many name calling posts or derogatory comments are voted up and posts of people so much as asking questions get voted down. It's almost as if people want to use the rating system to shut down opinions they don't agree with. You can see that the votes don't reflect whether someone made a reasonable comment or not, they reflect the side of the argument someone is on. Some day we humans will learn to have conversations without trying to shut other people up if they don't agree. 
	The whole blockade is illegal, if you didn't know.
	Actually, we don't even know if the blockade is a blockade in the legal sense...  Most countries in the world don't consider the blockade to be a legal one so the Flotilla technically wasn't braking any laws...  Not to mention the ships were heading to Eygpt where they would be transported by car but I can't understand why don't they cut out the ship bit and just drive everything into Gaza from the Egyptian side...
	What was factually incorrect in their questioning?      Also, they asked the same questions in different forms over and over again because HE DIDN'T ANSWER THEM. Maybe you could answer: Was Israel involved in the decision to arrest the captain and prevent the ship from leaving? Is Gaza occupied by Israel, meaning that Gaza's waters are Israel's waters?
	Yeah, America and Israel have such a great reputation around the world for not engaging in belligerent military invasions and genocide!  LOL!  It's a big reddit hivemind thing to describe humanitarian atrocities for what they are!  Reddit sux lol!
	That anti-American, anti-Israel stuff is really frustrating, isn't it? It's really distracting when one is trying to stand on someone's windpipe.
	&gt;DON'T YOU USE LOGIC ON ISRAEL BASHING REDDIT PARTIES!  Yes, because there is ONE and only ONE logical conclusion that can be formed on the basis of what we have read so far. /s
	You just responded to my criticism of American arrogance and self-righteousness by making fun of the Greek legal process.  
	good.
	Egyptian government officials fighting against Israel is the same thing as Democrats fighting against Republicans.    Fake.
	Pro-tip: try and use the same alt account for all comments in a thread it makes it easier to follow  1)Piling troops along a border is not an act of war, the fact that they had their air defence turned off due to internal unrest also suggest they weren't about to attack. Perhaps in your head Israel was attacked, but here in the real world Israel was the attacker  &gt;2) Yes they were. Technically though at the time they were not Palestinians, they were citizens of Syria, Jordan, and Egypt  And how many of them were armed and ready to attack Isreal? Oh none, really? It's almost as if Egypt and Jordan had chosen to leave Palestinian lands out of the conflict  4) Funny how you classify a human shield as a weapon, it's still Israeli bombs killing them.  5) https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/British%E2%80%93Zionist_conflict , but yeah pretend that didn't happen, because it's very hard to justify killing police to establish your right to some land while calling others terrorists for doing the same thing.  6) https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Aliyah_Bet and https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Zionism#History in 1946 Jews were 32.96% to over 90% in 1950 
	&gt;5) A completely untrue and hateful claim. Not really worthy of a response.  wow, talk about blissful ignorance and revisionist history. Nearly everything you say is made up zionist propaganda? how is it hateful to point out facts? especially the fact that israel was founded on the same exact kind of terrorism that they are now ironically so morally against. Not worthy of a response? more like you have no idea about what the hell you are preaching and can't find the proper retort to that fact in your zionism propaganda playbook.   http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Palestine/kidnap.htm
	Then why do they call it "the occupied territories"?
	Just because you're misinformed doesn't mean that others are lying.  &gt; The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs maintains an office on “Occupied Palestinian Territory,” which concerns itself with the Gaza Strip. A July 2004 opinion of the International Court of Justice treated Gaza as part of the occupied territories. In his statement on the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict Richard Falk, United Nations Special Rapporteur on "the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories" wrote that international humanitarian law applied to Israel "in regard to the obligations of an Occupying Power and in the requirements of the laws of war."[38] In a 2009 interview on Democracy Now Christopher Gunness, spokesperson for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) contends that Israel is an occupying power. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories#Gaza_Strip
	&gt;Actually, Israel isn't a signatory of the fourth Geneva convention (but it's probably jus cogens anyway)  Actually, it is. Israel is not a signatory to Protocol I, the vast majority of which is indeed customary in nature today and is binding on Israel.  &gt; however it does not forbid collective punishment it forbids punishing civilians instead of the military.  In the context of belligerent occupation, it most certainly does, and it is established under international law since the Nuremberg trials that a power can be considered to be an occupier even without having a ground presence within a territory and without its own military administrative system. See the Hostages trial. While your at it, read up on the ICTY's decision in the Naletilic case.  &gt;In the wars of today where there's a hazy line between who's a soldier and who's a civilian (and they all dress alike) the Geneva convention isn't an easy thing to follow.  Actually, it isn't all that difficult. The rules of engagement are clear - civilians may only be targeted for such a time they directly partake in hostilities. This is expanded in relation to civilians who are part of non-state armed groups, who are permissible targets. Otherwise, the principles of distinction and proportionality apply at all times. Derogation from these principles is quite simply not permitted.  &gt;Goldstone at least claims Israel did not attempt to harm civilians, see his article it the post from earlier this year.  Doesn't exactly do his credibility much good considering several other reports have shown otherwise, and seeing as he was pretty much pressured by the Jewish community in SA into retracting his statements. Goldstone was completely shunned by them.  &gt;You can't impose criminal like punishments, and you can't argue a blockade is a criminal like punishment.  Denying people the most basic goods, their freedom of movement and their ability to build up an economy isn't a criminal like punishment? Unnecessarily restricting construction material after the Gaza war, banning the most basic foodstuffs and completely restricting the freedom of movement of people is pretty much the definition of collective punishment.  &gt;You can impose a navy blockade of any state you're at war with, unless you control their territory - the division of Israel controlling the air and water of Gaza follows the Oslo accords, but Hamas controls the actual territory.  Except Gaza is not a state, it is still considered occupied territory. Israel maintains effective control, the main criterion for occupation, and what is required according to the cases I have mentioned above which are considered to be customary in nature is the ability to exercise authority at will where no ground presence is maintained - something Israel has done time and time again whenever it has felt the need.   It continues to monitor the territory through UAVs precluding the need for troops on the ground, and whenever it feels the need it does in fact bring in troops, a right it reserved in its "disengagement" plan. It also maintains the ability to stop Gaza's electricity and water and complete control over the population registry thus allowing it to decide who is a citizen and by extension who can come in and who can't.
	Used in that sense "terrorist" is non-sensical. It means the exact same thing, except conveniently allows for murder. Which proves my original point; that Israel argues semantics to justify their illegal and immoral actions.
	Keep drinking that kool aid. It obviously becomes true if you repeat the lies enough times.
	&gt;So once again, you admit it:   You seem to think you are scoring a major point here. I'm honestly baffled. Israel holds all the cards. economic dominance, military dominance, It holds all the land, it Has the ear of the world superpower.  The only way Palestinians can get any justice, or as you would frame it "win" is if Israel decided to show some mercy. &lt;heh I just had to pause for a minute laughing at that thought&gt;  or Israel is pressurized from outside, sanctions etc..
	The source is outdated. This is the actual list of items banned from Gaza  http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/HumanitarianAid/Palestinians/Lists_Controlled_Entry_Items_4-Jul-2010.htm
	[deleted]
	&gt;it's the same reason why israel's arab neighbors refuse to let palestinians out of refuge camps to assimilate.  I've taken control of my neighbors house and no one else will take them in so I can live in it undisturbed.   It's so unfair. They think its my problem. 
	&gt;  many us based companies have divisions in israel, and they only export ideas back to the us.   But surely they get paid for these ideas, and the wages they pay  in Israel using US money can be a proxy for exports.  And you can sum these wages up to get a true idea of exports.     Does this come anywhere close the $9.5B diamond exports?  In other words, we need numbers, not vague notions.
	Now *that* is a crime against humanity.
	Papandreou was born in the US.
	I recommend leaving idiocracy for 6 months or so. 
	It's actually a parody, not a straw man.
	He didn't deny to know whether Israel was occupying Gaza. He just avoided the question.
	So now that anyone reading malcontent's comments can see the incorrectness of your statement, what do you say?

	I live in Greece, Im 26 and I have gone to many rallies against Israel occupation and I have send support to Palestinians over the years.   Furthermore, Greece was the only western/christian country to vote against Israel.. And we paid for it diplomatically.  So your BS about morality elsewhere.    I know exactly how shitty Greece is..  and  I know exaclty how cool Greece is..  No need for your filtered televised opinion.   Edit: I like both Palestinians and Israelis, Im against brutality from both sides. 
	Damn that is one prejudiced and moronically overgeneralized statement. 
	&gt;Sure the jewish religion and culture sees nothing wrong with [collective punishment]  You're confusing the state of Israel with Judaism. It is not the same, not even close. Israel behaves exactly as the standard terrorist state behaves outwardly, and not even hugely different internally either. The Jewish religion is not responsible for Israel's terror campaign against Palestine any more than Christianity is responsible for it with the US being the real master here. Sure, some actions are carried out based on religious convictions but a) that's not what you were implying at all and b) said actions are not the same as foreign policy.
	If there's anything Europeans hate more than arrogant Americans, it's arrogant, self-righteous Americans.   The Captain sailed out without a permit and ignored the Greek calls to come back to port.
	So if I provided you a link to another government official who claims otherwise, would you find that convincing? If not, why would a person's opinion be of much value to me in this kind of situation? I would prefer to judge the situation by the facts at hand and not people's opinions. Especially when it involved an issue where there is so much hatred toward groups of people. Not just hatred towards Jews which has been ongoing since they originated, but also Muslims. I am not going to decide that Palestinians are bad because some government official things so. The real question should be why you find David's opinion more valuable than others? Is it because his opinion is the same as yours?
	I'm sorry, but your claims of people locking others in rooms does not seem to have any baring on this conversation. If you want to address the actual situation I am more than happy to respond. 
	Yes in the 1980s. Cool story bro.
	Yes, the vast Muslim world's hate of infidels and Jews perhaps?
	Israel is not blocking humanitarian aid with the blockade. It simply inspects the cargo for weapons as it has several times found 1000s of tons of weapons being shipped into Gaza by boat. So no law has been broken according to your link.   Israel actually arrests settlers. They have an ongoing battle with people who think they have a right to occupied land and those settlers fight with the Israeli government. Israel has to go bulldoze housing made by Jewish settlers. 
	 "HasbaraThirdShiftWeekendIntern" wouldn't fit.
	Except for the border with Egypt where all the stuff comes in.
	A blockade isn't an occupation.  If you wish to prove me wrong I'd love to see some facts.
	well, why didn't you just explain it to him
	"if israel was an occupying force, then there would be no blockade.   think about it for a second.   if israel still occupied gaza, they would be able to search goods coming into gaza ports. Because israel withdrew from gaza, they can no longer stop the importation of weapons without pressure on egypt and a naval blockade"  that is why some israelis regret ever leaving gaza in the first place.  Also, israel has asked egypt numerous times to take gaza, they don't want to get anywhere near it.  it's the same reason why israel's arab neighbors refuse to let palestinians out of refuge camps to assimilate.
	&gt;They took pieces of metal off the ship and said they would attack anyone who boarded the ship to stop them, the shooting starts after they were attacked.  That seems like a reasonable response to a hostile enemy boarding your ship uninvited.   
	The sheer fact that they boarded the ship is an attempted attack within itself. So Israel initiated the confrontation.
	Looks like jonnyclueless is looking at sources now, at least in the discussion with me, eg [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/if2nx/greece_arrests_captain_of_us_gazabound_boat_over/c239ehw)  . Those replies are also downvoted, to some extent.
	If the blockade were actually illegal, dont you suppose it would have been challenged in an international court.  The fact remains that no successful legal argument has been made to outlaw the blockade.  Furthermore, as someone else stated, not only does gaza not have a food shortage (and the only time medicine is in shortage is when hamas controls the supplies that come in daily), Israel is not occupying gaza, they are blocking the shipment of arms that we have repeatedly seen in the past.  That itself is more humanitarian the these flotillas. 
	None of those are laws have been violated. Gaza is not an occupied territory nor would the first link apply even if it were. With the second one, Israel does not prevent humanitarian aid from getting to Gaza. The 3rd one Israel does provide relief and allow relief from other countries and anyone who wants to provide relief. So  your argument is essentially that it's illegal because Israel is blocking aid from getting to Palestine. This is a completely untrue claim. So I ask again, what law is being broken?
	if israel was an occupying force, then there would be no blockade. think about it for a second. if israel still occupied gaza, they would be able to search goods coming into gaza ports.  Because israel withdrew from gaza, they can no longer stop the importation of weapons without pressure on egypt and a naval blockade
	I'm unsure, I know most of Western Europe don't view it as illegal but I can't be sure on Greece.   However they still stopped it on valid grounds --  they didn't have a permit and wouldn't return when asked.
	As if he didn't know.
	have you actually read the article, it's supports what I've said  &gt;Sovereign states have the right to defend themselves against overt external aggression, in the form of an invasion or other attack. A number of states assert that this principle extends to the right to launch military actions to reduce a threat, protect vital interests, or pre-empt a possible attack or emerging threat.  and here's an interesing tidbit, these are the reasons Egypt gives for the wars with israel &gt;The Arab position is that: The 1956 war was a result of a conspiracy between France, the United Kingdom and Israel in violation of Egypt's sovereignty. **Egypt claimed several legal justifications for refusing Israel use of the Suez Canal, including the right of self-defence.** The war in 1967 was an unprovoked act of aggression aimed at expanding the boundaries of Israel, and the territories captured during this war are illegally occupied. As a result, the territories must be ceded in order for peace to be achieved.
	How about you take just a minute or two and really educate us on how removing the "evil empire" USA would help the rest of the world? I know it is patently obvious to you, but some of us are just dumb and need your help. I appreciate the simplistic idealism of "just leave" but I am asking for a little more intellectual rigor from a Reddit scholar.
	excuse me Sir, but the continued perception of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza is the raison d'être for global terrorism, how dare you and this so-called red cross say bad things.
	Stop making the lies appear like lies!
	As far as I can tell from googling, the UN doesn't so much supervise as say that israel should lift the blockade and stop hampering UN efforts in the area. The UN is (or was until recently) explicitly complaining that it cannot deliver construction material. Can you provide any sources that state that the UN is (now) successfully supervising the import of construction material? 
	Dear Jonny Clueless, I doubt depriving the population of Gaza is "defending itself against Hamas".      Are you aware of the restrictions of items entering the strip? Are you aware of the illegality of the IDF boarding a ship in international waters and the right of self-defence? Are you also aware of the passengers in the flotilla including an elderly Holocaust survivor and many other peaceful activists? And if your claim is correct, what's terribly wrong with wanting to fight anyway in your opinion? Israel did and continually does for the sake of Zionism, a religious motivation, just like martyrdom is. "Armed to the teeth" is clearly a misguided representation, since they apparently defended themselves with makeshift objects.      Are you aware of the size of the Gaza strip and that pretty much any attack would guarantee to damage civilians and civilian buildings. And given that Hamas is a terrorist organisation, does that mean that all civil servants are terrorists too and all civilians that voted for the government and obey the government are terrorists?
	Really?  I scrolled to the bottom of the page and all of those comments were either "Fuck Israel!" or "Fuck Palestine!" or they were just unfunny jokes.
	They do carry aid, but it's true the primary job of the flotilla is to bring awareness to the issues.  I'd wager that most people in the world have no idea where Gaza is, what's going on, or that Israel is currently blockading it.  For most people, information on Israel-Palestine goes no farther than "A bunch of terrorists are attacking Israel".
	[deleted]
	the only reason they do this is for the publicity, they dont REALLY care about the citizens of gaza. if they weren't trying to be publicity weapons they would happily sail to israel and get searched for weapons first. 
	Your quote does not support the statement "Israel does not block crayons, books, candles, chocolate, clothing, etc" so for this, citation is still needed. If we leave this out:  Your list of items that *are* permitted does not appear to intersect with the list of items that johnfpublic states are not permitted. In short, as far as valid cited statements are concerned, your statements do not contradict each other so far.
	The question is...had they been carrying aid would they be allowed to sail?
	&gt; this means that all of the items that you listed are nit banned anymore.  Absolutely not. Israel has lifted the ban on some items, many are still banned from entering Gaza.   From the Wikipedia article:  &gt;According to the Haaretz, the number of items allowed into Gaza, since May 2010, is about 100. Before the blockade, some 4,000 items were allowed. Gisha states that a large Israeli supermarket holds 10,000-15,000 items.[17]  The article says the following as well:  &gt;Military. In 2010, Israel said it would allow all civilian goods into Gaza, but not "military items and materials that can strengthen Hamas's military machine".[4]  Which basically means that Israel can still ban anything under the premise of it being a "military item".
	You are correct and breakingbad8 is  incorrect. There is no list of items allowed into Gaza. Since easing the blockade, there is instead a list of items barred from Gaza. This is the list    http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/HumanitarianAid/Palestinians/Lists_Controlled_Entry_Items_4-Jul-2010.htm  The quotes he posted are out of date and no longer relevant. 
	When it is collective punishment.
	The Palestinians aren't dogs who have to wait for their masters to feed them.
	&gt;Stating it's to cause economic collapse would be easily proven wrong by the fact that Israel delivers almost all of those things.   Israel delivers these things (in very limited quantitites) in order to make the people of gaza dependent on them. It's a form of slavery.  Israel should stop delivering these things and let the rest of the world provide them through trade.
	&gt; So I think you may want to reconsider your position knowing that your own links disagree with your claims.  Lol, you're really new to reddit aren't you?   Abandon hope, all ye who enter here!
	you explanation assumes that jews go out and kill palestinians for no reason at all. You don't mention anything of collateral damage.
	So you think a ship should not carry protection in the event of hostile guests coming on board?
	&gt;They can't export goods or engage in proper trade, and as a result the people really are suffering.  Well then maybe they should accept the terms set by both Israel and the Quartet for the normalization of relations:  1) Renounce violence.  2) Recognize Israel.  3) Abide by existing agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.  I mean, if the international community has so much authority to order Israel around, why no authority to order Hamas around?
	I'm one of those crazy trolls always asking for facts and proof.
	Richard Falk is not the UN or part of the UN Security Council regardless of his opinions. That was my point. So, your argument would be a strawman.  Congrats.
	People are suffering because their leaders in Gaza, Hamas, are actively engaged in a conflict with Israel.  If that ever actually stopped I'd be the first one to say the blockade should be lifted.  But the problem is even when Hamas aggress to temporary cease fires they refuse to police the other terrorist groups.  There is a huge difference between a blockade and an open air prison.  Last april even deputy director of the Red Cross in the Gaza Strip admitted there [wasn't a humanitarian crisis in Gaza](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/red-cross-official-gaza-isn-t-experiencing-a-humanitarian-crisis-1.357268).  Now I'm not going to claim Gaza is some sort of paradise on earth but lets be real about what the conditions in Gaza are like.  Then maybe we can have an honest debate instead of exaggerations and false claims of occupation. 
	Care to prove that link? Or is this part of a conspiracy theory?
	every country in the world has a lobby in DC, are you saying that the jews through their crafty evil ways are pulling the strings, is that what you're saying? is it? I bet russia has a lobby in dc, I bet soviet union had a lobby in DC during cold war days
	GOOGLE IS AN ANTISEMITE!
	by that same logic, the USA has targeted and intentionally killed thousands of non-combatants in our two ongoing wars.  civilians die during war operations. that doesnt mean that soldiers are given direct orders to kill civilians, nor does it mean that they individually intentionally seek out and kill civilians.
	Hahahahahahaha!!!!! This is without a doubt my favorite response i have read to something i wrote on this site.  Ok, i have to think about what i can say that will be worthy of a response; you are putting a lot of pressure on me, which I think is unfair, but I will try my hardest.  If there is really a mutliverse, wouldn't it be reasonable to suggest that on another earth, on another reddit, i would be arguing against Israel, and you for it? Isn't that something?  Would you rather have your pinky fingers the size of your pinky toe, or have all your toes the size of your index fingers and be forced to wear flip flops forever? (Regular sized flip flops, so your super long toes would hang off the sides).  Do you think that this new obsession with cleanliness, specifically anti-bacterial soap and such, and the subsequent weakening of our collective immune systems will eventually come back to bite ass all in the ass?  Oh boy oh boy, I really do hope I get a response.
	Serious question: if you do it and it works, what are you not buying that is Israeli? Are you aware of what you ARE buying that's Israeli? How is it working?  I am inclined to agree with Imadeadman. No judgments either way, but boycotting Israeli products isn't very realistic if you actually look into what their products are.
	Well, I appreciate your honesty. I have made the same sarcastic request on Reddit before and am usually ignored or told I am brainwashed by the US media or some similar nonsense. I have learned that 90% of those bashing the US here are either foreigners who hate McDonald's (i.e., the "bad: aspects of America which is all they have ever seen), people who are jealous and wish they could live here, or pasty white American kids who need to get out more and stop listening to U2.
	I am sorry that I have to use facts and not join the anti-Israeli opinion parade. You calling it collective punishment does not make it so. The fact of the matter is that your claims are demonstrably wrong. You are against them because you claim they prevent humanitarian aid from getting through. This claim is 100% completely false. The last flotilla incident was delivering 2000lbs of expired medical supplies. Israel alone delivers over 6000lbs of this every single DAY. It sounds like the discrimination going on may actually be on your side. You have decided to use demonstrably incorrect claims against a group of people simply because of who they are. If you want to go only on rhetoric I cannot stop you, but you cannot expect a reasonable person to agree with something based simply on rhetoric. 
	No, that's the truth. Unfinished goods, that have the "final assembly" done in America, can be and is classified as "made in the USA".
	Don't you think that the most important thing for Greece is economical revival now? And the countries who take US/Israel side generally do better than the other side (I'm from Israel, and I love Greece, just been there few weeks ago).
	&gt;They did this in preparation, before any boarding.   That seems reasonable if the pirates are circling your ship and looking for boarding opportunities.  
	you're making it sound like jews go out and kill palestinians for hell of it, it's not a war because israel doesn't allow it to escalate through actions like blockades, and yes they didn't kill as many people as they could have you're finally seeing the light, that point contradicts your assertion that jews kill palestinians for shits and giggles
	You mean the resolutions which won't hold Hamas accountable for the very same things? The UN which also elects countries with some of the worst records on humanitarian rights to head groups to monitor human rights? An a UN resolution did not create the country, it only acknowledged it. Let me ask you this. If the UN were to do the opposite and write resolutions that would punish Hamas and not Israel, would you then cite them like you are now?
	[LOLUN](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1106/S00739/un-names-north-korea-chair-of-arms-control-agency.htm)
	Of course Israel will claim that the blockade is "against Iran"....  propaganda aimed at simpletons..... what else would they claim? That they are collectively punishing 1.5 million people with an average income of $1/day, 40% of which are children, in a strip the size of an airport in which they have created a 300 yard death zone? They need the Iran bogeyman to justify their war of starvation against a stateless civilian population who are mostly refugees of Israel's 1948 ethnic cleansing.  If only people knew the facts...
	&gt;At one time all of the following was either outright banned or restricted by Israel: books, candles, crayons, clothing, cups, cutlery, crockery, electric appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines, glasses, light bulbs, matches, musical instruments, needles, sheets, blankets, shoes, mattresses, spare machine and car parts, and threads fishing ropes and rods, ginger and chocolate, hatcheries and spare parts for hatcheries Batteries for hearing aids have been restricted.[16] Wheelchairs, at various times, have been banned. cement, glass, steel, bitumen, wood, paint, doors, plastic pipes, metal pipes, metal reinforcement rods, aggregate, generators, high voltage cables and wooden telegraph poles are high priority reconstruction materials currently with no or highly limited entry into Gaza through official crossings  If you read the wiki [citation](http://www.economist.com/node/16264970) none of these were ever banned as a matter of policy, in each case it was a one-off thing. 
	Because you know the world economy? It sucks...
	1.  The acts of sabotage were almost certainly committed at the behest of Israeli Intelligence (Mossad).  This is not a matter or conjecture or partisanship.  No matter what side you're on, this was mossad, to seriously suggest otherwise insults the intelligence of the reader.  2. Why has Greece taken actions against the activists? This is a question of conjecture.  Who knows, probably a combination of things.  Some possible reasons: Israeli and US diplomatic pressure (they clearly oppose) Israeli statements about terrorists being involved, blame terrorists and say Hamas is behind the flotilla, this helps with the diplomatic pressure:  "In Jerusalem Friday, Israeli military spokeswoman Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich cited intelligence information that claimed Hamoud Tareq, a son-in-law of Hamas leader Khaled Mashal, was among the flotilla organizers." [Source](http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1018237)  There's plenty of other possible reasons for the Greek response, but again it's all conjecture for the most part.  We don't need to rely on "Amereeerika told em to jump so they jumped", or much worse nonsense like anti-semetic ramblings.     TL;DR: The Greek government caved to outside pressure and it's not like they really give a shit about the flotilla anyway, they're broke. 
	&gt;keep going with your conspiracy theory  that everyone hates Jews?
	&gt; ...Or maybe the fact they left port without permission and broke greek law. buy keep gong with your conspiracy theory that has no merit at all [...]  Then what do you call [the blanket ban of ALL ships sailing to Gaza from its ports](http://www.hcg.gr/node/647)? A new law that was *specifically* made to stop the Flotilla from leaving, regardless of seaworthiness?  And what about this:  &gt; On Friday evening, Haaretz [reported](http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1233281.html) that Greece had promised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday that it would stop the flotilla. Israel, the report said, used its influence in recent months to help the Greeks in their negotiations with the European Union regarding the country’s financial crisis.  Source: http://972mag.com/flotilla162011/  What has happened here has never happened before. Yet to note the fact that Greece going out of its way to do *exactly* what's in Israel's interests is "a conspiracy theory that has no merit at all"?
	Also spraying the deck with automatic weapons fire prior to boarding? 
	They weren't boarding someone's boat, a boat breached a naval blockade. The only response to such a breach is to board the ship in order to take control and stop it. The captain of the boat was more than happy to, however the militants on board would not allow them to. So the boarding of the ship was a response to an act of war (breaking a military blockade). Clearly NOT instigating. That would be like saying that the US was instigating when they set up a blockade to stop the USSR from delivering nuclear missiles to Cuba to aim at the US. 
	Soldiers rapelling down first were only armed with paintball. Some of them had their SMG's taped to their backs.   After the "peaceful" flottila crew attacked and stabbed multiple commandos, the Israelis resorted to using firearms.  Sorry, but it's like attacking a police officer and expecting not to get shot.
	He was 19, no? Not a kid. Do you honestly believe that the commandos, legit super soldiers, just walked around shooting people for fun? I know you don't, and i also know you saw the many many videos of the Turks attacking the soldiers *as they were boarding*.   It's all simple logic honestly: if you don't want to die, don't attack soldiers. I get it, most Americans get it, most people get it, but reddit does not.  Edit: and the first commandos to board, were in fact only brandishing paintball guns. Once they were stabbed and beaten, they decided to do what had to be done. 
	and what about looking at what's happening first hand: http://witnessgaza.com/
	The UN does not consider Gaza occupied territory. You are lying.
	1) Yes they were. All the surrounding countries piled their troops at the border which is an act of war. It would be like me holding my hand to your throat and then me claiming you are the aggressor for trying to get out of the stranglehold.   2) Yes they were. Technically though at the time they were not Palestinians, they were citizens of Syria, Jordan, and Egypt. Those of course weren't the only countries that participated in the attack against Israel but they were the ones who had nearby land from which attacks were launched against Israel.   3) Yes they do all the time. Actually most simply took countries. This was standard practice in most wars. Israel didn't want to do that so they just made them buffer zones, or at least that was the original intent.   4) You can't use death rates because Hama's primary weapon is using human shields. The high fatality rate of Palestinians is not because Israel targets them, it's because Hamas uses them as shields. Israel on the other hand phones every house in a surrounding area to notify them of an incoming attack so the civilians can flee. Unfortunately many of them choose to stay in hopes they will die because they believe it will get them into heaven without judgment.   5) A completely untrue and hateful claim. Not really worthy of a response.  6) Of course completely untrue and absurd statement to make. This notion that Palestine was originally occupied by Arabs and then one day after WWII it was decided to move a bunch of Jews there is the biggest myth I have ever seen. There's no truth to it, but most people seem to actually believe this. 
	&gt;5) It is important to remember that Zionist terrorism was used to help found Israel (for reference 996 innocent Brits died)  It's only terrorism when Arabs and Muslims do it. You should know that by now.
	&gt;Just to put things in perspective. In the 1st quarter of 2010, just before the big Flotilla incident Israel delivered 94,500 tons of supplies to Gaza. Including:  That's outrageous.  Who are they to decide how much supplies gaza gets, when they get it and what those supplies are?  It's immoral and disgusting and the fact that you think it's some sort of an honor shows us how backwards your religion and culture are.   
	I don't think you should use a government source to argue against people questioning the actions of that very government.   EDIT: Deleted my other bit because I thought you were referring to the May 2010 flotilla, which had no missiles onboard.
	So once again, you admit it: Hamas wants the international community to win its unwinnable war for it.  Hamas is exploiting the international community as a stick with which to beat Israel.
	there's a difference between civilian casualties during a war combat operation, and targeted killing of civilians, dumbass.  and guess what, who do you think uses willie pete more often? [that's right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_phosphorus#Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_.282010-2011.29)
	Please explain to me exactly how Israel is occupying Gaza.
	nope, but if after this (and the situation in the past few months) you don't think that the greek government is corrupt and immoral  then you are one deluded angry 11 year old. 
	So is "sheep" the conspiracy theorists go-to name? Anyone who doesn't see the same way as you, or doesn't believe that every event is some massive conspiracy is a sheep?  *"OJ is the best juice you sheep!"*
	Ah, thanks for the info. I found the article you mention.  I have downvoted myself now.  :)
	put on your tin foil hats everyone, greece is now under US and Israeli control
	Zing.
	Yeah, taking us own a peg is sure to help all of those poor downtrodden folks around the world. I'm sure you can think of literally dozens of examples of how that will be true. Maybe just list a few for those who don't get it. TIA
	Excellent strawman, sir.
	I responded to your comment by saying that israel behaving like thugs is not helping their position.
	I'm not talking about any conspiracy, just that most people in the world, be they in the US or Africa either don't know or don't care.  They don't have to be Republican or dumb, or anything.  As you said, some people have bigger issues to deal with.  The purpose of the flotilla is to get attention to the suffering of a certain group of people.
	&gt;Reddit is somehow mesmerized by Palestinians and how the evil jews   Notice how nobody here has used the word "Jew" or "Jews" except the pro-Israelis.
	Israel is doing everything to becoming the 4th Reich.
	"I have not locked anyone in any room. The reasons the walls are there is to protect against attacks. You are talking about a guy who has kept yelling at me that he will fucking kill me if I don't let him out right now."

They said the damage can be repaired and that it will not affect plans to sail for the Palestinian territory toward the end of the week.
	Your username is a true reflection of you.
	Israel breaks all kinds of the Geneva Convention:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Geneva_Convention#Section_I._Provisions_common_to_the_territories_of_the_parties_to_the_conflict_and_to_occupied_territories  On top of the blockade, Israel commits a war crime with every settler it places in the other occupied territories.
	I love how 31 people downvoted your post because it's not sufficiently critical of Israel.  These are facts, people.  Hamas has not engaged in any steps towards peace.  They are absolutely part of the problem, not the solution.
	&gt;Hamas, the political entity in charge of Gaza isn't part of any peace process.   That's because israel and the US refuses to sit down with them.
	Actually Israel encouraged the growth of Hamas as a counter measure to the less Islamic groups.... if you want to talk about timelines:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Hamas#Early_Islamic_activism_in_Gaza

	Even David Cameron, the PM of UK, believes that Gaza is an open air prison:  http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jul/27/david-cameron-gaza-prison-camp  But you are free to disagree.
	And was there nothing *else* that would drive people to fight, either?
	If Palestine has no legitimately elected government (as has been claimed), then it has no organized armed services or police forces, then it stands to reason that ALL Palestinians are civilians.
	[Not what the UN says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Fact_Finding_Mission_on_the_Gaza_Conflict#Civilian_targeting_allegations)
	&gt;No it has not. But please feel free to cite your source.   How about international law? The collective punishment of a population is banned under Protocol I to the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
	You claim that it's better to stick to facts and ask for sources but you have provided none. Your argument is invalid. Israel is inhumane.
	This news to you?  You think HAMAS can suddenly reveal hidden Armored divisions, an Air force, A Navy, all capable of taking on the IDF?  I wonder about your deductive abilities. HAMAS route to victory will be to wear down, keep fighting with what they have, and make the Israeli people force their leaders to the negotiation table. That will be massively aided if they can get world opinion on their side. 
	are you retarded? seriously  &gt; "Israelis don't fire missiles into population centers with the intent to kill civilians" where were you last   Tell me what the fucking fuck is happening in that slide show then?  http://www.hrw.org/en/features/israelgaza-photographs-white-phosphorus-use  It is Israel flinging Willie Pete at civilians. Do you fucking see that little girl in slide before last with a bandage on her arm. That is fucking white phosphorus that can burn through skin and through bone. And is Israel throwing that shit at civilians. Or is that girl a terrorist now and deserves it?
	Only because they have better weapons now. When they didn't, they used the very same tactics. 
	&gt;this is just retarded. Israelis don't fire missiles into population centers with the intent to kill civilians.   Of course they do.  What makes you think they don't? 
	&gt;Why is Israel Blockading Gaza? Because Hamas uses ships to have Missiles and weapons delivered from Iran and use them to attack Israeli civilians.  If that was the case then the only item on the banned list would be missiles and missile components. But its not.      [**The Red Cross Report:2008**](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/chronic-malnutrition-in-gaza-blamed-on-israel-1019521.html) The Israeli blockade of Gaza has led to a steady rise in **chronic malnutrition** among the 1.5 million people living in the strip, according to a leaked report from the Red Cross. It chronicles the **"devastating"** effect of the siege that Israel imposed after Hamas seized control in June 2007 and notes that the dramatic fall in living standards has triggered a shift in diet that will damage the long-term health of those living in Gaza and has led to alarming deficiencies in iron, vitamin A and vitamin D.  [**Israels attitude. 2006**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/apr/16/israel) "The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet," jokes Dov Weisglass, Olmert adviser.   &gt;Why is Israel so brutal? That's subjective, but the reason is because Israel is under constant attack  And the only response to the feeble attacks is brutality. Negotiation? thats for the weak.      Look how the British managed to defuse the IRA calls for a united Ireland. Bombed, starved, and walled in the Catholics. Or did they?  &gt;Why do the Palestinians fire rockets? Hamas has stated that it's goal is to eliminate Israel.   Does anyone think those rocket can "eliminate Israel" Seriously? Home made unguided rockets? Have you heard yourself?  They fire rockets because not to fire rockets is to surrender. They place no premium on peace. they have many issues more valuable that peace. Some form of Justice being the highest. To address those issues would be very uncomfortable for Israel. Settlers, land acquisition, water resources, nationhood. Thus Israel will not address those issues but rather continue as things are  &gt;Why is malnutrition rife in Gaza? Because Gaza's government spends all of its resources on trying to attack Israel..  Nothing to do with Israel controlling the food resource then. Glad you cleared that up.   [**UN report:**](http://www.pcusa.org/middleeastpeace/pdf/middleeastpeace-fullreport.pdf) 22% of Palestinian children under five are suffering from **malnutrition**—a three-fold increase from 2000. * 9.3% suffer **acute malnutrition**—an eight-fold increase from 2000. 15.6% suffer **acute anemia,** which can lead to permanent impairment of physical and mental development. **Food consumption has fallen 30% per capita;** 60% of Palestinian households now live in acute poverty; and 50% are dependent on international food aid.        [**European Union Report 2004:**](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/palestinian-malnutrition-at-african-levels-under-israeli-curbs-say-mps-568896.html) The report said that Palestinian farmers had land confiscated, crops damaged and were “plagued” by problems in getting goods to market. MPs condemned the Israeli government for preventing the free export of goods from the West Bank and Gaza, and urged the EU to suspend Israel’s preferential tariff rates until they allow Palestinians free access to European markets. They said: **"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is a deliberate Israeli strategy of putting the lives of ordinary Palestinians under stress as part of a strategy to bring the population under heel"**. The report said movement restrictions on the Palestinians were justified by Israel as security measures, but warned that **“in reality they have been a mechanism to put pressure on the Palestinians by crippling the economy**”  &gt;Why has this dragged on for 40+ years. Because it's based on religion   Nothing to do with land then? I wonder if you believe yourself. Do you think if the Israeli and Palestinians were both Christian sect all would be hunky dory?   &gt;Whats Israel doing in the West Bank? This is an area that I don't agree with Israel on. However to be fair, this land was originally designated to them, not the Palestnians.  What?  
	I doubt Hamas would have gotten a single vote if it wasn't for Israel's refusal to make any compromises.  Israel has all the bargaining and military power.  They will never stop the occupation or colonizing the West Bank.  Look at the Palestine Papers...the PA was practically willing to give up everything to Israel and they still got rejected.  So naturally, once you have weakened all the moderates and demonstrated that you are not interested in peace but in territory..people are going to vote the other way just like Israeli's went more right wing when they felt frustrated with the Gaza situation.
	With absolutely no proof,  that statement is completely irrelevant.   But funny. Trust me, we are all laughing at the idea, just like when an [Egyptian Governer said that Israel trained a shark to attack tourists.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/8185915/Shark-sent-to-Egypt-by-Mossad.html)  
	On Reddit, the US always ends up being blamed.
	&gt;The Captain sailed out without a permit and ignored the Greek calls to come back to port.  That's because greece made it illegal for any ship to leave greece for gaza at the last minute.  
	&gt; Democracy Now interview that he abruptly ended when they started asking tough questions  I just watched it and you are describing completely incorrectly.  First of all, the interview was not ended "abruptly" - they spoke at great length.  Secondly, the interviewers asked factually incorrect questions about the events of the past.  Thirdly, they kept asking the same questions in different forms over and over again.  I can't believe the guy was as polite as he was.  
	sure, there was absolutely no political ass grabbing going on by israel to prevent the flotilla from leaving port right?  This would all just go away if israel would end their unjust blockade of Palestine.
	DON'T YOU USE LOGIC ON ISRAEL BASHING REDDIT PARTIES!  It will, I repeat, it *will* get you downvoted. The best way to proceed in such anti-israel discussions is to go with the rest and bash both America and the Jews.
	&gt; Israel consul general Ido Aharoni refused to deny  Just FYI.  It is Israel's policy to neither confirm or deny anything that may or many not have to do with their intelligence services.
	&gt;A report released Monday by the International Committee of the Red Cross is calling on Israel to lift a 3-year-old blockade against Gaza, saying "the closure is having a devastating impact on the 1.5 million people" who live in the Palestinian territory. ([cnn](http://articles.cnn.com/2010-06-13/world/israel.gaza.closure_1_gaza-strip-palestinian-territory-blockade?_s=PM:WORLD))
	I'm Greek and I am surprised and disappointed with this. This is what happens when you have an [American-born](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Papandreou#Early_life) prime minister.
	can you explain what's wrong with stopping the flotilla in it's tracks, they're looking for a confrontation, and then yell and print racist opinion pieces about all the supposed atrocities the israeli commandos committed on their boat. breaching the blockade is illegal, and probably announcing the intention to breach the blockade.
	Apparently both financially and morally. 
	&gt; This is US/Israeli pressure at work.  What do you expect?  Greece is for sale these days.
	Not sure why you're getting downvoted. Plus the BBC did a Panorama episode on the last flotilla incident with footage from on the boat with people basically saying they were looking for a confrontation. 
	&gt;Why can't these flotillas ever be put together to deliver actual humanitarian aid?  Why should they have to be?  This is a protest march in the sea.   It's to demonstrate to the world that the israeli govt will shoot and and kill protesters just like the syrian govt does.  &gt;The article even quotes someone who claims this one will be a success even if it doesn't sail. Could they try telling that to the starving children in Gaza to see if they agree?  Jesus fucking christ on a pogo stick. You admit childen are starving in gaza and yet you attack the protesters who want to bring attention to that instead of attacking israel which is causing the children to starve in gaza.  What is wrong with you?  &gt;. But why not have someone with more than a 7-year-old's organizational skills put together a non-political aid flotilla and send that in?  No such thing. Israelis wills top all aid and kill people attempting to deliver it. They proved that over and over again.  
	Israeli cockroach spotted. Someone throw a shoe.
	&gt;These boats are not there to deliver humanitarian aid, they are there to violate a naval blockade.  The boats are delivering humanitarian aid *by* violating a naval blockade. The two things are not mutually exclusive. By implying that they are you are being deliberately dense.
	&gt;Hello. First time poster. Finally felt a need to add a clarification. These boats are not there to deliver humanitarian aid, they are there to violate a naval blockade.  So fucking what?  They are there to shine a light on the immoral and indefensible blockade of gaza.  It's a protest march of sorts.  &gt;The purpose of the blockade is because many times Iran has been caught shipping hundreds of tons of missiles and weapons to Hamas.   So what?  Why should only one side of this conflict be armed? Why should israel be able to kill people like  shooting fish in a barrel in gaza without the gazans being able to defend themselves?  
	&gt;If they want to deliver humanitarian aid, then they can easily do so. They just need to bring them to port Ashdod. There the cargo can be inspected to make sure there are no weapons, and then delivered to the Palestinians.  I would believe you were simply ignorant, but upon reviewing your comment history, it's clear that you're intentionally lying. [This is a list](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/05_05_10_gazaimports.pdf) of items allowed into Gaza. Anything not on that list gets conviscated. That includes stuff like wheelchair batteries, concrete for building, and even chocolate. These people clearly want to ease the suffering imposed on the Gazans by Israel. Only a Zionist could turn people trying to get humanitarian aid to impoverished prisoners into an attack on Israel.
	An illegal naval blockade. Nice try, hasbara.
	&gt; Stating it's to cause economic collapse would be easily proven right by the fact that Israel controls almost all of those things.   FTFY
	All the flotilla give a shit about is attention. Israel is being a dick per usual. Hamas is playing a wolfs in sheep clothing. Sadly the average Palestinian isn't being affected by this either way, still living in deep poverty. If they spent 1/8th as much time as they do finger pointing, then I'm sure things would be more stable and people would be better off.
	I'll just [leave this here.](http://rigint.blogspot.com/2008/03/deep-ones-and-madness-of-crowds.html)
	How much do they pay you megaphone idiots?
	Nope.  It would continue to provide evidence that there is more than one side to every story, and that the side that the media talks to doesn't realize that much of the story is not being told.  If people found out how many groups labeled as "good" were actually causing harm through rhetoric or action, they would pull support from pretty much everything as they would fear similar levels of corruption in other groups that are claiming to be good and actually are.
	I don't need to prove you wrong. You do it everytime you post.
	That border is also heavily regulated. If it allowed "all the stuff" to come in, the blockade would be a heavy waste of time.
	I know, they are so bad on the weekend they are undermining their own agenda...
	Gaza is still recovering from Operation Cast Lead, another unpunished Israeli war crime. When Israel offers reparations for OCL, your pretty talking points might sound true.
	Stealing land, destroying people's homes, and denying access to build and infrastructure might have something to do with it
	Events that happened in the 80s still have ramifications today you say? Shocking!
	I would do research about what the actual definition of "infidel", the Quran refers to the polytheistic tribes that inhabited the Arabian peninsula at the time of Mohammed as "infidels", Jews, Christians and other Abrahamic religions were referred to as "people of the book" and are to be treated with respect according to Islamic law. The hatred of "Jews" is really the hatred of a western state that is present in the Muslim, and more importantly Arab world. There is a somewhat utopian vision of a united Arab/Muslim state in the Middle East, a vision that Israel interferes with. It is not the hatred of the Jewish religion, but the hatred of a western country in the Middle East that happens to be comprised largely of people who are members of the Jewish faith.
	It wasn't always about Islam.  Read about how Israel encouraged the growth of Hamas in order to weaken the secular Palestinians:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Hamas#Early_Islamic_activism_in_Gaza
	But they didn't stop the ships on those grounds, now did they?
	International humanitarian law, actually.  [Here's an article on wikipedia (yes, I know, "wikipedia") concerning the decade-long arab-israeli conflict and international law.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law_and_the_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict)  For your convenience.
	Actually the post you cited is either incorrect or a lie. His sources are all outdated. At the end of June 2010 Israel significantly eased the blockade. His sources are all from before that.  This is the actual list of Items banned from Gaza.  http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/HumanitarianAid/Palestinians/Lists_Controlled_Entry_Items_4-Jul-2010.htm
	I made no mention of why things are banned. I said it was to inspect for weapons. Your link is also out of date. Perhaps you should have linked to the links in your link instead. There are materials which have dual purposes. For example the materials for construction often times can be used to build bunkers to launch attacks from. These kind of materials have to be delivered with supervision to insure Hamas does not use them for attacks. Much of those things listed in the link you provided are no longer banned because Israel agreed that there was no need to restrict them. They changed. Of course none of the things listed are also much of a necessity either.   And lastly many of the things listed in the link you provided are flat out wrong. Perhaps one of the reasons why the articles have since been updated. If you are going to sit here and claim that Israel bans clothing and books from being delivered when they themselves deliver such things by the 1000s of tons PER DAY, then I can't really take your link very seriously. It's a shame that in this day and age we have this kind of bigotry that causes people to assume assertions are correct simply because of the race or group of people they are made against. 
	Just go watch the Panorama episode. They took pieces of metal off the ship and said they would attack anyone who boarded the ship to stop them, the shooting starts after they were attacked.
	You're getting downvoted because you're making claims without sources and then denying the posts that refute you with evidence.. Also, you're a bit of a hypocrite since you are belittling other posts for not having sources when you yourself have provided none.
	That's because the "world court" is toothless and because Israel and USA has such a huge saying in it.
	Israel and US are effectively immune from International prosecution.  EDIT: It seems people don't agree my statement. Why not?  The US voted against the creation of the International Criminal Court (along with China, Libya, Iran and Saudi Arabia).^1      &gt;The United States initially wanted a court, but one that would never work against the interests of the United States. The model preferred by the US, joined by China and France, was a court controlled by the Security Council, where they could use their superpower veto to stop any embarrassing prosecutions.^2  The US will therefore deny international prosecution.   This international legacy stemming from Nuremberg is also, ironically, not supported by Israel:  &gt; The Netanyahu government voted against it, as a protest after the Conference agreed to make forced settlement of occupied territory a war crime. Israel had settled over 200,000 Jews in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip after the 1967 Six-day War, but since the Statute is not retrospective, Israel's fears that its leaders might be put on trial were nonsense. Forced population transfers can be a potent means of ethnic cleansing, as Serb actions in Kosovo in early 1999 showed, and Israel's decision to vote against the Court merely because its statute included this as a potential crime was a betrayal of the memory of the Holocaust.^3  So, why not? Both are effectively immune from the court.     1. Robertson, Geoffrey QC. 2006. *Crimes Against Humanity*. 3rd Ed. Penguin Books. xxv-xxvi.   2. Ibid 421. 3. Ibid 424.
	Fourth Geneva Convention, articles 33, 55, 59, 60 (linked below)  http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebART/380-600038?OpenDocument  http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebART/380-600062?OpenDocument  http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebART/380-600066?OpenDocument  http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebART/380-600067?OpenDocument  Israel's argument against this (as I understand it, could be wrong) is that the people of Gaza are adequately supplied with their basic human needs and that they [Israelis] are not an occupying force. I believe that's where the "debate" comes in. 
	Is this only the trade between the US and Israel? Even if it is, i seem to be wrong anyway.  Regardless, I do not think the people buying diamonds are going to boycott, especially not from reddit.   Edit: my argument is still solid, naturally, because it's a real argument. 
	don't forget that some 'things' don't get exported because they are ideas.  many us based companies have divisions in israel, and they only export ideas back to the us.  israel has the highest per capita number of scientists in the world.   many of the ideas coming out of israeli labs are patents owned and held in the us by us companies.  that wouldn't show up in israeli export data, because the 'things' that come from those labs is us owned and china / mexico / whatever other place makes those 'things.'  the israeli scientists got to take home a paycheck though.
	PHP, for better or for worse...    
	Its not something you will see in export statistics  Alot of the newer Intel processors are designed in Israel  one of Microsofts biggest development centers is in Israel  Kinnect was invented in Israel by Israelis   Same with Google and many many many more International companies  Israelis are awesome at tech, (internationally) tiny Israeli banks have branches in Palo Alto.  You can't avoid it if you use technology   
	Yeah - and the US hand over billions for them to do it, and lend them political support in the UN. 
	I think you meant to draw some sort of analogy with the situation in Tibet. The situation in Israel involves one group of people oppressing another...
	Wrong.  Jews cause everything..
	Are you suggesting the blockade is justified or in anyway not violating human rights? It is a conflict of an eye for an eyelash.
	no reason to be downvoted other than the r/worldnews circlejerk.  sorry about that. 
	and this *isn't* a conspiracy theory?
	Keep telling yourself that. If you repeat the lies enough times, people might actually start believing you.
	oh just die already
	You sound like these guys who claim that Obama was born in Kenya.   "He's a dirty foreigner, must be evil".
	I boycott loads of Israeli products such as McDonald's, Coca Cola, M&amp;S, Pepsi because it's not that hard but stuff like Intel is impossible as it's in every computer basically. Viva Palestina! 
	&gt; You have, do, and will continue to buy Israeli products.  But any talk of Israeli conspiracies to rig markets is just absurd.
	&gt;Dude you're completely brainwashed are you kidding? Get outside of your simple ZIONIST=BAD narrative and realize that humanitarian aid has absolutely nothing to do with this flotilla. If they wanted to deliver aid they could drop their foodstuffs, etc at the port of Ashdod.  They have no guarantee any of the items they deliver in ashdod will make to the people who need it.  Israelis will take whatever they need or want from the load and then delay the entry of the rest for as long as they want.
	&gt; solving the **crysis.**  The greek really do have a corrupt politician assigned to absolutely everything imaginable. How big is this department and how far have they come in beating the game?   The rest of the world cant just stand idly by as they surpass us in this area!
	israel is on a religious war against their arab neighbors.  They are a terrorist nation and I'm pissed off that MY American Tax Dollars are being pissed away to support this shit fucking country and shit fucking leaders.  I would love nothing more than to tie the leader of israel down, force open his mouth and take a **MASSIVE AMERICAN SHIT** inside his mouth.  Here's Patriotism for you, fuckhead.
	&gt; they just want another Israeli PR screw up  And the Israelis, it seems, were only too trigger-happy to oblige.
	Ehh, that not going to happen with Hamas in charge of Gaza, not Palestine, Gaza.
	No, they want to look cool in the newspapers.
	&gt; Greece has always been pro-Palestine and anti-Israel.  Yes, and anti-american as well. 
	Wishful Jew is wishful.
	So its ok to arrest people for crimes they didn't commit so they don't commit a crime later?
	judaism is unique in not giving a fuck about converts, fyi
	Yes, you definitely sound not racist, enlightened non-Arab guy.  You might read about what happened when different Muslim countries attempted to erase Israel off the map. It might pinch a hole in your flotilla enthusiasm bubble.
	&gt; So not only did they refuse to let them sail, they arrested the captain.  Under International Law[1] they could have crucified him for piracy.  [1] See Caesar vs Pirates, [Plutarch Caesar 1-2](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html)
	Hello. First time poster. Finally felt a need to add a clarification. These boats are not there to deliver humanitarian aid, they are there to violate a naval blockade. If they want to deliver humanitarian aid, then they can easily do so. They just need to bring them to port Ashdod. There the cargo can be inspected to make sure there are no weapons, and then delivered to the Palestinians. These ships have no intention of doing this, they simply want to break a naval blockade and then use the humanitarian aid to make people think that Israel is trying to stop humanitarian aid from getting to Palestinians. The truth of the matter is that the amount of humanitarian aid that these flotillas bring is only a fraction of the amount that Israel gives to the Palestinians on a DAILY basis. The purpose of the blockade is because many times Iran has been caught shipping hundreds of tons of missiles and weapons to Hamas. The only way to prevent this from happening is with a naval blockade. It's far more humanitarian to stop shipments of weapons then to try to destroy those weapons once Hamas has placed them in civilian buildings with the intent of killing civilians should Israel defend itself from attacks by these missiles. 
	lol, you sir are funny.  Israel never wanted a confrontation, its clear that the flotilla activists brought it on themselves, as seen very clearly in the BBC documentary, news sources, and videos. 
	&gt;This is US/Israeli pressure at work.  Yes, I imagine The last thing Greece needs now is to disappoint the USA. A phone call to the Greek ambassador in Washington would have done the trick. 
	(Greek here) I am **completely** amazed that the authorities acted on an "anonymous complaint." Usually these are filed directly to the litter bin, because, as we have explained in the past, public workers are lazy. They only investigate eponymous complaints (because they are the only ones that require the authorities to file a report of the investigation).
	you really should read up on the flottila incident and how Israel was not the instigator or bad guy in that situation.  Bad things tend to happen when raving fucking leftist lunatics attack S13 commandos, who are only armed with paintball guns.  How the fuck can you people be so brainwashed by liberal media!?!?
	Putting yourself in danger to peacefully violate government regulations has often been considered an acceptable form of protest. Not disagreeing with anything you said in particular, just adding that despite the illegality of their actions, or the legal right of the government to detain them, the flotilla(ians?) aren't necessarily reckless or misguided.
	There's always someone who comes along and tries to rationalize the irrational. Today that's you. 
	Aww.  **Edit:** :(
	&gt; it is in fact illegal to leave port without the proper authorization   spend a few years in the shipping biz mate and you'll learn something
	The international red cross recently said that there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza. If these idiots wanted to actually make a difference they should go up the coast a few miles to Syria, where kids are being castrated. 
	Seriously this has what the "left" has become, just as stupid as the likes of Fox news? Burying your head in the sand and not listening to facts?
	&gt;you're making it sound like jews go out and kill palestinians for hell of it,  I am pointing out that for people who did not grow up in your religion and culture "I didn't kill as many people as I could have" is not an expression of virtue.  &gt;it's not a war because israel doesn't allow it to escalate through actions like blockades  Again from the perspective if judaism and the jewish culture I am sure this is seen as an virtuous act.    From the perspective of a modern, secular humanist point of view this is abhorrent.  You are not recognizing the vileness of your actions because you were brought up in a culture and a religion that taught you that it's OK to conduct an occupation, it's OK to subjugate millions of people to your will and control, it's OK to deny them anything you don't approve of in order to continue to make them subject to your will.  This is no different than a muslim cutting the clit off of their daughters or forcing their wives to wear burkas or flying planes into buildings. They think there is nothing wrong with what they are doing because they were brought up in a culture and religion that taught them that was the proper way to behave.  You are proud of the fact that you could have killed hundreds of thousands of people but you only choose to kill thousands and the muslim is proud that he could have killed the entire family of the person that had sex with his daughter but only chose to kill her instead.  Both of you think what you are doing is just, moral, and defensible.  It's not. 
	&gt; I would actually love to see someone come up with a reasonable response Israel should have to the missile attacks  At least you appear to imply that Israel's actions are unreasonable. That's a good start.  If Hamas got as much loot from the US as Israel does, I'd denounce Hamas every time I denounce Israel. Luckily, it's not incumbent upon me to denounce Israel's enemies. Israel and its enemies have no particular good will toward my people.
	Whatevs, troll.
	They can't export goods or engage in proper trade, and as a result the people really are suffering.  There's a reason that people don't use tunnels for trade unless they have to.  It doesn't work as well as having ports that ships can move in and out of, and borders that goods and labor can travel over.
	Yeah, They gave land back to Egypt. The only nation that could potentially give them a black eye.   Palestinians?. Poor fuckers. They are going to keep being fucked over. again and again. Thank God I'm not a Palestinian.   &gt;Also, Israel does not 'control all access' to Gaza. See: Rafah crossing.  Israeli Control over Rafah was stitched up in agreement with Egypt well before the pull out. I could post up the info but I have before. it didn't stick then and wouldn't now.     Be interesting to see what happens now Mubarak is gone. 
	By your own token, you can't be believed either because you're as pro-Israel as others are anti-Israel.  You can't have it both ways, but I'm sure you try.
	&gt; That's the primary reason why the US often refuses to agree to many of these UN treaties.  The primary reason is because Israel has a lobby that has much influence in DC.
	See ninjarob's reply to your earlier post.
	Ever heard of something called Google? Try it.
	If I were the leader of Greece:  "What debt? *Lolololololololololol*"
	Those aren't percent, but billion dollars. From that diagram:  Total Greek debt is $485B.  The French part of that is 56.7/485=11.7%  Germany's part is 33.9/485=7%  United States' part is 7.3/485=1.5%  The amounts in the diagram you linked only add up to about $130B. The big remainder of the debt is held by Greek banks ($70B), mutual and pension funds ($80B), insurance companies ($50B), private investors,...  *EDIT*: The numbers above come from your link and [this one](http://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/2011/06/15/who-holds-the-greek-debt/).  [Here](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2011/06/29/608786/restructuring-the-greek-pie/) from UBS are pie charts (in Euros now) that contain all Greek debt, but not split into the different countries' parts. EMF holds €62B, IMF €18B, etc.
	&gt; everyone hates Jews  You hate Jews. Because you're probably a scumbag. Don't refuse the responsibility for your attitude by saying that "everybody does it". They don't.   &gt; Stealing other people's land is definitely a move only Jewish character could stand behind.   Where are you from? Not that I care, but I'm sure that your country stole land from someone. There are no countries established without dispossessing the unlucky.  &gt; Turkey will wipe the floor with you should it come to blows; compare Turks' military history with Jewish  Who knows, they don't have the ultimate weapons that Israel has. Also, Turkey refused to let the flotilla sail from their territory, they wanna suck up to us again :)
	You can't just call-in your debt on govermnet bonds.  They are sold with a specific maturation time period, they will be bought back after that maturation period not before.  If a bond holder wants to get money for his bonds before they hit maturity they have to sell them to a 3rd party usually for less than they are worth.  
	&gt;A major part of the problem is that Hamas does anything it can to launch attacks on Israel and as a result the innocent people have to suffer.   Collective punishment is immoral and illegal under international law.  Sure the jewish religion and culture sees nothing wrong with it and in fact according to your culture it's the prefered way to continue the occupation but you must realize that the people who were not raised in your fucked up religion and culture it's wrong and should be stopped.
	Ok, so the source is based on reports by single people. Most other sources can thus be used to refute items listed in the source, provided such sources exist.  I'm sure that both Hamas and the Israeli government both attack each other, make concessions to each other, and make demands of each other.  In the mean time the population of Gaza suffers, of course. Wiser minds have tried to find solutions, and have so far failed.
	It was the most accurate list we had found in this reddit thread so far. Then you came in, and now we have a more accurate list.   Please assume good faith. Most people are generally good and don't deliberately mean harm. The original list came from wikipedia, and that article hadn't been updated. I've posted a link to the newer list on the wikipedia talk page. 
	"A major part of the problem is that Israel. "  Ftfy. 
	Are you for real ? Use google and please read through all sides of the story. Reading your replies is like reading Israeli press releases.  And switch off your pro Israel filter when you google please.

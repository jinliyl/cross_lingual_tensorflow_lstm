-	-	Because willful ignorance solves everything. 
-	-	Always fight ignorance with ignorance.
-	-	No, you’re right, no downright lies.   Unless it’s in a food scare story. Or a disease scare. Oh, or an immigrant scare. Or some ranty pro-Israeli nonsense, of course, a couple often creep in there. Or some anti global warming gibberish. Otherwise hardly any downright lies at all.
-	-	I don't think anyone here is making the joke that raping a prostitute is only theft. Prostitutes can and do get raped, but that may not be the case here. You're arguing against a straw man. 
1	6	Why would I bother? If it has some truth in it I will see it reported on the BBC or nytimes or some other well-reputed newssite.
-	-	Well, they had sex.  That's proven by physical evidence.  You think she threw him a freebie?
1	4	Those jokes are always made when the idea comes up. I'm not trying to argue that the article is suggesting it or that the defense will suggest it or anything silly like that, I'm just trying to head it off at the pass because reddit's full of people who think it's hysterical.
-	-	Hey, it’s working for Fox.
-	-	With an opportunity for extortion? I’d say that was well inside a reasonable doubt.
-	-	It's possible. Possible enough to cast doubt on a solicitation charge.
1	4	Here's one possible narrative:  Strauss-Kahn solicited a prostitute who decided afterwards to blackmail him. Being French and perfectly okay with soliciting prostitutes, he likely rebuffed the blackmail. She then came up with the story about how he had raped her as a means of revenge and possible restitution. 
-	-	And we all know you can't rape a prostitute.
-	-	So, Strauss-Kahn solicited a prostitute...  Lemme check... Yup.  That's still illegal in New York.  See also:  Eliot Spitzer
-	-	…according to a source about as credible as the Daily Mail.
1	4	We already have misogynists on reddit assuming that it probably didn't happen because he could afford to pay for better, now she's alleged to have worked as a prostitute so I imagine we'll see people taking this as fact (because "a source close to the defense" is known as a reliable guy) and assume she's a vindictive hooker looking for a big score while making the occasional joke about raping a prostitute only being theft.  I haven't been following this case so I don't know a lot about it, I couldn't have less of an idea if this dude is guilty or not and the article mentions some things from the District Attorney that certainly damage the woman's credibility assuming they're true. But the alleged prostitution rumour being published without any corroborating evidence is lazy, prejudicial faux-journalism that reinforces the misogyny inherent in a lot of these kinds of cases involving rich, powerful men and will only serve to bolster the sort of people who immediately dismiss an accusation like this as the work of money-grubbing attention whores.
-	-	Possibly interesting... but it's on foxnews. I have no reason to believe anything they write.  So, I didn't look at the article and no upvote from me.
1	4	The Daily Mail may have a very right wing stance, but they are nothing like Fox News. At least they report the truth horribly spun rather than downright lies.
-	-	That's exactly the point of this unsourced, blatant hit piece (getting people to speculate wildly about her being a lying, conniving whore).  No evidence, just a guy who said it.  Let's also not forget that the entire "theory" of her being a "big earner" is based upon her being in a union which claims she isn't a member.  BULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLSHIT.
-	-	Stupid New York.
-	-	NYTimes has already uncovered her phone calls, which are rather incriminating. "I know what I'm doing. He has a lot of money," she said.   Try putting two and two together. The answer isn't "5."

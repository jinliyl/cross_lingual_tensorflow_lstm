0	2	I accept your unconditional and cowardly surrender. Off you go.
0	1	&gt;In prison communities there's a lot more gay partnerings than gays.  I think that's called rape, but whatever melts your butter kid.
1	6	What are you babbling? Teaching kids that, "When you have sex with someone, you automatically get whatever disease they have and any disease anyone they've had sex with had." isn't about aids and homosexuality, it is about scaring people about the dangers of all STIs. STIs are a serious health problem, and it is true in a sense that when you have sex with someone, you can catch whatever sti they have, which they got from previous partners. While one can question the legitimacy of trying to scare kids instead of just teaching them the facts, it isn't about being politically correct about AIDS and homosexuality.
1	4	Thank you; this is what I was trying to say.
1	8	Understood. What a devastating way to contract HIV. Not to say that it's not all unfortunate, but damn.
-	-	Yea; 'oh hey I'm gonna live! ... wait'
-	-	&gt;Even if the MSMs were actually gay, one reason I can think of why they don't identify is because society,  Fear of what society thinks is irrelevant. You are what you are regardless, all the cutesie acronyms in the world can't change that.
-	-	I see what you did there...
-	-	Only in the heat of the moment.
-	-	Apparently highest transmission rates are actually through blood transfusion and childbirth, if you check out the transmission sub-heading on [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV#Transmission) wiki page
-	-	TIL when a guy has sex with another guy, it's not considered gay.
-	-	The problem with the condom starts *when it's not really that hard*...
-	-	If it wasn't hard, the condom wouldn't work. 
-	-	[might learn a bit here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation)
0	3	I read claims that it's well over 20 times higher, the risk that is, than what this article quotes (18 times). I don't know if it matters much, since the general consensus should be that it goes with a much greater risk.

-	-	Really? So Tom Cruise is straight because he says "HE'S IN LOVE!!!!!" with Katie?  Now who's being naive.
0	2	So a man can have sex with another but they are not gay or bisexual apart from rape how does this work.  So a person who rapes cats is not into beastiallity as long as they say so, no matter how many cats they rape.
-	-	&gt;That really isn't true. There's a big difference between behavior and identity.  Its called being in denial. Try not to overthink it.
1	6	&gt;Actually, the highest infection rates are in men who have sex with men (MSM),    Ok I'm with you this far....   &gt;who don't necessarily identify as gay or bisexual.   lol. Whether they "identify" being gay or not, they are gay. Being in denial doesn't make them straight. They don't get to choose or "identify" what they are. I think your love of over-catagorization and worthless acronyms is clouding your thinking.  This also seems like a convenient means for the gay community to disown the problem of HIV transmission and blame straight people, as they so often like to do.
-	-	Over here a condom!
-	-	The wiki transmission stats I was referring to were just for the chance of contracting HIV through those means (blood transfusion etc.), not the overall occurrence. So the rate of transmission through blood transfusion may be reduced (I'm not sure about the US statistics), but the (estimated) chance is not reduced. 
1	4	I'm glad I was able to teach you something.
0	2	|Anal sex is seen as a cultural loophole ಠ_ಠ
0	3	&gt;Duby presented the findings of her study, which interviewed almost 400 people in **Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya**  I just want to point out this statement is meant to apply to people in these areas.  As a heterosexual I clicked the link expecting to find an article claiming my middle school education was wrong, and that anal sex was somehow not more dangerous.  I imagine that these statistics would be quite different in other regions of the world.
1	6	We should start a rumor that sex with a condom doesn't count (and it would almost be true).  Then the cultural loophole would be the condom. Tada!
-	-	&gt;thigh sex, even armpit sex - people have sex in lots of ways  &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;  
-	-	Geez people. Don't you know you can even get AIDS by seating on the toilet seat?   Especially if the previous guy is still there
0	1	The first symptom of HIV is a pounding sensation in your asshole.
0	2	Always where a condom! is it really that hard?
-	-	Its obviously misunderstood by gays even more so as they are the ones with the highest infection rate.
-	-	Haaaaaaaaay gay guys, chicks have butts.
-	-	This is the problem with sex education in the United States.  I was taught "When you have sex with someone, you automatically get whatever disease they have and any disease anyone they've had sex with had."    I suppose this was based on either a politically correct desire to not acknowledge that AIDS was and is primarily a gay disease in the United States, or alternately, the desire to promote abstinence as the only solution.  Sadly, I see a parallel in our laws that falsely equate marijuanna with heroin and cocaine, and the school taught doctrine that they are similar.
-	-	&gt;where a condom!  There a condom!
-	-	Everywear a condom!
1	6	the other people who replied to your comment are missing the obvious.  male/male sex = homosexual sex = gay.  heterosexual people do no have homosexual intercourse, by definition.  EDIT: to the people downvoting this - why don't you break out a dictionary and look up the definitions of these words.
-	-	I tried to read it but I'm on an hdtv from across the room so I have to zoom into webpages to read. Try zooming on that page (everything gets bigger, text almost seems to get smaller! wtf)
0	2	Anal sex is shitty
-	-	this needs more upvotes.  
-	-	Yes. For the record unprotected anal sex is more dangerous than unprotected vaginal sex because it isn't naturally lubricated and lacks the many layers of skin inside the vagina resulting in a higher chance of tearing which aids (NO FUCKING PUN INTENDED) the transmission of HIV to one's bloodstream. 
-	-	Deserves a megusta, really.
-	-	More like a cultural poophole, amirite?
-	-	Actually, the highest infection rates are in men who have sex with men (MSM), who don't necessarily identify as gay or bisexual. Oftentimes these men also have risky sex with women, which is why it spreads so easily and readily through groups of people who assume they and their partners are heterosexual. I believe the second highest infection rate is in black men; HIV/AIDS has been absolutely devastating to the black community.
-	-	I've lost six girlfriends this way.
-	-	Yes
1	4	Ah, thanks for the information; I actually meant the rate of occurrence for new infections, which is slightly different than transmission rate. Though haven't blood transfusion transmissions been cut down to almost zero in the US? Maybe the data on the Wiki page is from worldwide information.
1	8	That's exactly what it's for... and personally, I despise it.  It's become a very difficult psychological challenge for me as an adult. 
-	-	Everywhere a condom! 
-	-	Sexuality ≠ behavior. People are free to identify as bisexual, for instance, whether or not they've ever had a same-sex partner.
0	2	That really isn't true. There's a big difference between behavior and identity. Refusing to acknowledge the fact that there are plenty of men who have had risky sex with other men who are not gay and go on to have risky sex with women or other men in the future is to cabin the scope of our consideration of the HIV problem and denounce responsibility. If it's just seen as "their" problem, mainstream communities feel entitled to shirk their duties to practice safer sex. 
-	-	&gt;This also seems like a convenient means for the gay community to disown the problem of HIV transmission and blame straight people, as they so often like to do.  Can you elaborate what you're saying here as HIV/AIDS doesn't distinguish between gay/straight. So it's rather difficult to put any weight on anyone putting "blame" somewhere.
-	-	In prison communities there's a lot more gay partnerings than gays.  I had a neighbor who got infected this way (in a Haitian prison though).
-	-	Reddit is a place of learning.
-	-	People like clean little labels, don't they.
-	-	The CDC [backs me up](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/msm/index.htm).  And, yes, sexuality is based on how one identifies.
1	8	I think you missed the point of my reply. And I can't tell if you're trolling or earnestly believe what you espouse; so I'll just let you stew. Bless your heart.
-	-	[deleted]
1	7	Even if the MSMs were actually gay, one reason I can think of why they don't identify is because society, as you do, looks down on the LGBT community, particularly cultures of machismo. And btw, as a member of the gay community: no, I don't "disown" the problem of HIV transmission. It's a huge public health concern within my community that I'd like to ameliorate.  &gt;Try not to overthink it.  Try to think. k thx bye.

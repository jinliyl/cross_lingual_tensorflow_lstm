-	-	Actually, the blockading state has an obligation to *stop* every ship and only allow through cargo (not the vessel nor the crew) that is considered vital for survival of civilian population. A lawful blockade must be effective (in that the blockading state has the capacity to enforce the blockade) and indiscriminate (in that nobody may pass through the blockade period). 
-	-	So Gaza can impose a blockade on Israel? Oh, right, Gaza isn't a state. How convenient.
-	-	My sincere apologies.  I forgot that Israel owns the Mediterranean Sea.  (By the way, I notice the same cast of characters citing to the same nonsense and cutting and pasting the same materials, including this MikeSeth who replied to your post...do you all operate off the same "Zionist or Dummies" handbook, or is this some bizarre coincidence?)
-	-	&gt;same cast of characters  Fools. They think they can pettifog, split hairs, create diversions: "Look at Syria!", and those of us who can see and add will just shuffle off and not notice what un-regenerate swine they are.
0	2	A dangerous message now being sent by the international community courtesy of Israel, Greece, and the United States: "Peaceful protests of Israel will not be tolerated, even when that protest includes sending humanitarian aid to a country that isn't Israel, but merely borders it." So what now? Shall the Palestinians in Gaza commit mass suicide to satisfy the needs of the international community? A self inflicted genocide? Or would that be perceived to be an attack on Israel as well?    I am utterly disgusted.
-	-	&gt;"Pursuant to a decision by the Minister of Citizen Protection Mr. C. Papoutsis, the departure of ships with Greek and foreign flags from Greek ports to the maritime area of Gaza has been prohibited today."  I wasn't aware a ship that's registered in a different country can be detained, unless its guilty of breaking that nations laws. Presumption of future illegal actions unconnected with your nation is a strange precedent to act on.  Is this normal and legal?
-	-	Good. These flotillas are just creating unnecessary tension on the issue.

-	-	Economically bankrupt, now morally bankrupt?
-	-	Wait, wasn't Greece a recipient of a significant amount aid themselves recently?  I'm not going full on tinfoil hat here but it seems a bit odd that all of a sudden they're doing Israels bidding here.  Where did that money come from?
-	-	Attempting to break a military blockade is not a peaceful protest.  You can believe it is legal, and that it is the right thing to do, but it is not peaceful.
-	-	"Normal" and "legal" doesn't apply to Israel. 
1	4	Until now we were supportive of the Palestinians and, although unofficially, we were sending aid, allowed the flotilla to use our ports and there were Greeks participating. I suppose that since in the last incident Turkey/Israel diplomatic relationships took a hit, either the Greek or Israeli diplomats started cooperating. IIRC yesterday Netanyahu called the Greek PM a "good friend".

1	4	Breaking laws =\= non peaceful.  It's called civil disobedience.  Unarmed non-violent actions like the flotilla can certainly be considered peaceful.
-	-	The IMF and the ECB.... But yeah, I suppose since they are "owned by the Jews" it came from Israel right?
1	6	What does docking in Egypt have to do with any of this? 
0	3	Sending food to starving people is not inconsistent with "peaceful protest" nor is it inconsistent with "non-violent" protests.  You've heard the term "civil disobedience?"   By your logic, Rosa Parks was committing a violent protest by insisting to sit at the front of the bus because the "law" restricted her from doing it.  This is a cop out.  It's an excuse by Israel (as it was by Southern racists) to play victim and decry those on the flotilla mission as terrorists.  
0	1	Nobody in Gaza is starving. Seriously. People in Gaza are wealthier, healthier, and better-fed than most people in the non-oil Arab states. Their life isn't awesome, for sure: the serious travel restrictions and the attacks brought upon them by Hamas/Islamic Jihad provocations are awful. But they're not starving, and people in Cairo and Damascus are. The "human rights" crowd has their priorities way fucked up.  As for the flotilla: if they're just delivering food, why wouldn't they just agree to let Israel inspect it first?
-	-	Malnutrition - maybe. [Starvation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation) - not a chance.  There is no way in hell these flotilla yachts could carry enough food that would suffice even for a single day.  This is a protest flotilla not an aid mission.
-	-	This is a flat out lie: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7191359.stm  As for your final absurd point, what right does Israel have to inspect the contents of a ship not bound for its shores?    
-	-	nvm
-	-	Dude, newest article you could found is 3 years old?
-	-	"Starving" implies that people have died because they did not get enough food. This is quite simply not happening in Gaza, and to say so is lying. Even that article you linked never said anyone died from lack of food.  Any state has the right to inspect the contents of a ship trying to pass through a blockade it has imposed on any other state. Blockades are a totally legal, expected, and accepted aspect of war, and adhering to them is an expected part of customary international law. Look up the San Remo Manual for a brief introduction to how blockades work in international maritime law.

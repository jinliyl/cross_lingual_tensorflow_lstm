Ahmed Abdul-Aziz [...]  &gt;Another Beirut-based activist, Omar Idibi, said the Hama governor was respected by residents for trying to avoid further bloodshed [...]  Not to worry - I'm sure SANA will announce that they suddenly discovered that Mr. Abdel-Aziz is a secret Mossad/CIA/Al-Qaeda operative after a few days, maybe he might even have an 'unfortunate accident' or perhaps he'll suddenly commit suicide by shooting himself in the head six times or more. People who fall out of favour with the Syrian regime tend to have a short life expectancy and often die under mysterious circumstances.

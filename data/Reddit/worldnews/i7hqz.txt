0	1	Crying shame that was.
0	5	Yes... "tragic accident" .....
0	5	Total coincidence. It was all just a sad coincidence. Not looking at you Iran.   /tinfoilhat
1	4	Good. Iran don't need nukes.
-	-	These people who help Iran seem to run into some interesting accidents.
-	-	Mossad at it again?
1	6	So the Israelis are the only people in the Middle East allowed to have nuke??  Why??  They WILL use them at some point, it is just a matter of when.
0	2	It was a Tu-154.  It is quite possibly the worst aircraft in civil service today.  They are horrible pieces of crap.  I felt safer on a bus in Bolivia and a train in India than I did on a Tu-154 in the Ukraine.    Fun fact:  The NATO designation of the Tu-154 is "Careless".  
1	6	What's tragic about it?
0	2	People die in a terrible accident and the top comment is some ridiculous conspiracy theory?  You guys are fucking insane.  Get a grip. 
0	5	riiiiiight........plane crash....
0	1	This is just too much.... does anyone seriously believe this was just an 'accident'?
-	-	Right, that's it. Next time I book my flight ticket, I'm checking the passenger list to see who's on it. Does Ryan Air offer that service? Probably, but would have to pay extra to see the list, though.
-	-	A camera captured the incident on the ground:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEx7HL4H5yk
0	5	Oh, the _other_ people and the crew? Yeah, that's tragic. I thought you meant that the death of _techs who were helping the oppressive dictatorship in Iran to get nukes_ was tragic.
1	8	Of course, this was almost certainly an accident (as there is no evidence at all to suggest sabotage) but if it were an assassination, it can hardly be said to be carried out by people who don't care about the lives of anyone who is not like them.  The 5 scientists were using knowledge they had to give a known madman and violent murderer of civilians of his own country the power to threaten, oppress and kill many more.  The death of others aboard the plane is tragic, the death of these five men is the silver lining to the tragedy.

The 5 scientists were using knowledge they had to give a known madman and violent murderer of civilians of his own country the power to threaten, oppress and kill many more.  If they were killed, it was by people who care a lot about the lives of innocent people all over the world.  The death of others aboard the plane is tragic, the death of these five men is the silver lining to the tragedy.  Now, the kind of people who actually do the kind of thing you're incorrectly suggesting was done here, like people who fly planes into buildings, or carry explosives into public places like subways and coffee shops, those are monsters who don't care about the lives of anyone who doesn't accept that they should be the totalitarian masters of the world.    But you have to get your facts straight as to who the bad guys are (the ones who initiate force to kill innocent people and/or empower monsters to commit their crimes by supplying them with weapons) and who the good guys are (innocent people) and who the heroes are (the innocent people who kill bad guys, especially before the bad guys complete their evil deeds).
-	-	Some billionaire who is wholly good like batman, who will only use them in case on alien invasion.  
1	4	Came here to say that. I flew in one once, and besides the odd noise, felt fine.
0	2	Mossad: Getting shit done since 1949.
-	-	Probably Russia really, the Russian Government is very divided about Iran due to them training and arming rebels in Chechnya. It also wouldn't be the first time they used this method for assassination.
-	-	I wouldn't be so sure about that. There are people who do it, people who plan it, people who give money for this - all of them have something to say. I agree that those who choose such a scare tactics are mean motherfuckers; capture&amp;prosecute is the civilized way.
	don't be a troll
1	4	ha ha! 
-	-	Cool reply Moshe.
0	2	If morality is determined by how many innocents get in the way, I guess america has to take a second look as well. being intentionally obtuse doesn't suit either of you.
1	8	I used it once man, whatever though, I can tell by your comment history that you are a sad lonely person. Try being a little less negative and you might have friends. 
0	2	&gt;fundamentalist fuckwits  Only a delusional paranoid Israeli can believe this.
1	4	Nice straw man.
-	-	So you do think the situations are similar.  This must be something in the jewish culture or religion.  Thanks for the insight you have given me about the jewish cultural thinking process.
1	4	So, let me get this straight.  This is your thought process: "He and I disagree. Therefore, he must be failing at life, because anyone different from me can't possibly be successful, or that would mean I'm not the special snowflake mommy said I was."  Wow.
-	-	So which type of antisemite are you? The nazi or the anarchist version?
-	-	go blow yourself up mohammed
-	-	Coincidence?
-	-	Iran......naw that shit was probably the U.S 
-	-	That crash was because of pilot error: the pilot tried to force his plane down through fog without knowing where the runway really was. 
0	1	Plausible deniability!  Those damned diabolical geniuses!
-	-	Mossad.
0	2	The world of government spying, assassination, and espionage. Crazy shit.
-	-	Yeah, they took out some folks who had something to do with Poland the same way.
1	8	It's looking unsafe to supply the middle east with nukes.    What a shame...?
-	-	It also seems to me that there would be much surer ways to take a plane down than disabling its lights and counting on fog and the pilot to work together and produce a crash.  It *must* be possible to land on instruments alone, even in Russia, and even in a crappy old Russian plane, right?
-	-	People who do stuff like this generally don't care about the lives of anyone who is not like them, and people who care about the lives of people who are not like them are not like them.  They already think they did it properly.
0	2	naw shit? June 24, 2011: The day Reddit was overrun by wannabe rappers.
1	4	Thanks Israel!
0	2	I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic.  You're being sarcastic, right?
0	1	killing scientists after the fact and also murdering 45 other people in the process  for revenge is getting things done right?  I guess that's jewish morality.
1	6	killing scientists after the fact for revenge is getting things done right?
0	2	Not everyone who calls out  trend-slave posers is doing it for attention. Some of us just really hate trend-slave posers.
-	-	I would think that stuff like this is done under the guise of "national security", so the usual system of prosecution (the one not involving pitchforks) would be out.  As for the people who are involved in planning and execution (the people who give money is us), they have historically had families to feed and bills to pay. That they haven't done anything for that reason *should* change, and indeed might be changing, but so far it hasn't much. That's assuming they can overcome the propaganda.
-	-	What you're talking about is pre-crime enforcement, of a nuclear *power* project, not necessarily a weapons project. I wonder what the headline would have been had the scientists on the manhattan project been murdered. All of the nations that are doing the enforcing already have their own nuclear weapons, and some of them, who don't exactly have the best human rights track records, are still denying that they do.  And the bad guys are most certainly not the ones pointed out by the perpetually pro-war corporate media. They may be assholes that most likely belong in some type of work camp, no doubt. They're politicians. But they are not the ones who have as much to gain from having planes flown into buildings (*one day* after announcing that up to 2.3 **T**rillion dollars in penta~~gon~~gram spending cannot be accounted for), and continuously throwing the world into global war.  Good guys, bad guys, heroes and villains might work in the Marvel universe. What we have are central bankers, their minions and the rest of us.
-	-	Like other countries with atomic weapons aren't oppressive. 
-	-	We have to forgive belch_ew he got such a Zionist rush from the death of the Russian scientists that he forgot about the other people on the plane.   It happens...in Israel.
-	-	You _are_ aware that [Poland blamed Russia for the death of the Polish president](http://rt.com/news/russia-blamed-kaczynski-crash/), right?  If the present air crash was sabotage, it's more likely to have been Israel. 
-	-	America wiped out two Japanese cities in order to destroy a couple of targets that were "probably" military factories.  I guess we've got them beat.
0	2	Yes, of course there's someone behind it all. A very quick google search will reveal TONS of iranian nuclear deaths. Use Google news with "iranian nuclear physicist killed" and you have a lot of reading.  * 1 Dec 2010 - [Iran Calls Nuclear Physicist's Killing Terrorism, Notes Western Silence](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-01/iran-calls-nuclear-physicist-s-killing-terrorism-notes-western-silence-.html) * 29 Nov 2010 - [Iranian 'nuclear scientist' killed](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/11/201011297228879910.html)  * 12 Jan 2010 - [Iran nuclear physicist killed: Iran sees US, Israel behind the attack]( http://www.csmonitor.com/World/terrorism-security/2010/0112/Iran-nuclear-physicist-killed-Iran-sees-US-Israel-behind-the-attack)  * 4 Feb 2007 - [U.S. website: Mossad killed Iranian nuclear physicist](http://www.haaretz.com/news/u-s-website-mossad-killed-iranian-nuclear-physicist-1.211920) * 25 Jan 2005 - [Geopolitical Diary: Israeli Covert Operations in Iran](http://www.lebanonwire.com/0702MLN/07020407STR.asp)
0	2	&gt;'leading conspiracy theorists'  That's like saying 'distinguished crazies'.
0	2	wow you took that awful serious I musta struck a nerve
0	5	Not Jewish. Sorry to burst your anti-semite bubble.
0	2	I don't believe you. 
1	4	[ha ha!](http://www.reddit.com/user/JSIN33) in-fucking-deed. Quite an obsession you got going there.
1	4	Thanks Brother.   
1	4	Haha... I have a feeling that if every time someone was surprised at how self-centered you are, they got "awful serious, shucks!" your entire little township would probably be at a constant standstill.
-	-	KILLUMINATI!
0	2	This is one stupid conspiracy theory. There were even survivors. Who would leave survivors???
-	-	In Soviet Russia... Karma downvote YOUUUUUUU
-	-	Never fly on a TU-154. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Polish_Air_Force_Tu-154_crash
0	1	First of all scientists don't help with "secrets"  It is a secret if it is unknown to the public.   This is known to the public.   Not sure what the fuck you're talking about dailymail.  Why you use such weird wording?    Next,  WHY the fuck would there be a conspiracy involing russia?    These are some very well educated scientists.   Losing them is a problem for russia (and Iran as well),  even the article makes this point.  Please stop tinfoiling your head and stop with the ridiculous conspiracy theories that make NO sense.    I will concede that if anyone,  the Israelis would be the most likely assassins in this,  though even that, is a jump.  
-	-	definitely a coincidence .  edit: already said.
1	6	Anyone remember [the plane crash that killed the President of Poland](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/2010_Polish_Air_Force_Tu-154_crash), Lech Kaczynski? Apparently, [something suspicious occurred on the ground](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEx7HL4H5yk).
-	-	[Seen exiting the scene](http://i.imgur.com/oyUwb.jpg).
-	-	What's that bit about the Iranian plant being built over a "join" of three tectonic plates?
-	-	all according to plan. MUAHAHHAH
-	-	Planecrash, a perfect way to afford plausible deniability to accusations of removal of political opponents.  Senator Stone. You will be remembered.
1	4	Through pilot error? Wow! 
0	1	The fact that 45 people died you fucking asshole.
-	-	Wait, you're saying _Russia_ killed them?
1	8	What a great loss to militant Islam.
-	-	Who does?
-	-	Actually, it was a Tu-134, though they are apparently [retiring both models now](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/eu_russia_plane_crash)
-	-	I was outside at the Moscow airport a few months ago and heard what sounded like a full afterburner takeoff of something big &amp; heavy - like an F-15 or even a B-1.  I looked over and it was a Tupolev, of all things.
-	-	And by Tu-154, you actually mean Tu-134?
-	-	And bullshit gets upvoted because it has the tone of 'Russian technology is crappy."  As noted below, this plane wasn't a Tu-154, it was a Tu-134, which actually has a better record than a Tu-154.  That said, the Tu-154 has an average track record when compared to Western planes. I couldn't find the total flight hours (though I think it is smaller than the flight hours for the Tu-154) but a total number of 1025 Tu-154s were built. A total of 39 had fatal incidents. The Airbus A310 had 255 built, with 9 fatal incidents. That's 3.8% vs 3.5%. Keep in mind that the Tu-154 had was released in 1968. The Airbus 310 was released in 1982.  Wikipedia notes,  &gt;Since 1968 there have been 39 fatal incidents involving the Tu-154, most of which were caused by factors unrelated to the aircraft itself but more to its extensive use in demanding conditions.[3][4]  &gt;The Tu-154 is described as having an average (or better than expected) safety record considering its length of service and heavy use in demanding conditions.  &gt;  
-	-	Yeah, they flew into a mountain... on top of a bunch of bullets. 
-	-	In an unrelated news, Israeli Defence Force spokesman stated "The Israeli state does not condone any nations nationals assisting Iran with nuclear research. While this may have been a tragic accident, it is not appropriate for IDF to confirm or deny whether they died as a direct result of IDF or Mosad activities."
1	6	45 people... Disregard of collateral damage during enemies assassinations - it does happen pretty often around the world. Time to stop it. IF YOU CAN'T DO IT PROPERLY, DON'T!
-	-	Dude, I think you need to get out more - do you even remember what outside feels like?
0	1	&gt;"dude you could be slightly retarded"    Nice sentence structure.  &gt;", how is spelling a word a cry for attention. fuckin' hipster"  Nice comma splice. Oh, by the way, questions end with... a question mark!  &gt; fuckin' hipster  You keep using that word...
-	-	You really think the situations are similar?  
-	-	"Someone has done or is doing something similar or worse in the past therefore Israel's every action is justified."
0	5	Well, the news wasn't reported as "45 people killed in plane crash", was it.  If people who are helping fundamentalist fuckwits get nukes so they can more effectively kill more people wind up dead in a fire... well, pardon me for not crying about it.
0	1	&gt; Like other countries with atomic weapons aren't oppressive.  Yeah, that's what a clueless fucking child might say. No one who knows anything about Iran would, though.
-	-	No, but they're less likely to say "Allah will protect us!" *beep*  EDIT: At least until Michelle Bachmann takes over the U.S.
0	1	trend slave posers? dude you could be slightly retarded, how is spelling a word a cry for attention. fuckin' hipster
-	-	Do you think that maybe they wouldn't feel the need to obtain nuclear weapons if there wasn't a hostile. nuclear armed country in the vicinity, or another hostile, nuclear armed empire expanding on either side of them?
1	6	I know!  Your excitement about the death of the Russian scientists is perfectly understandable...you got such a Zionist rush from the headline that you typed your comment before the reading article.  This is only normal...in Israel.

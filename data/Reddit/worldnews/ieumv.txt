-	-	There has been rioting in Belfast in nearly every decade of the 19th and 20th centuries. The 21st will be no different however, these pale in comparison to what happend 30- 40 years ago, simply because Norn Iron is no longer the sectarian state it was, there is no fuel( at present) to ignite that sort of conflict.  The legacy of the troubles has strengthened sectarian divisions somewhat, especially in inner city Belfast, but overall the country moves slowly forward.    Once the marching season finishes it will quieten down. Dissidents may remain and loyalist gangs might flare up but there is no real Ian Paisley type figure to fan the flames or mass protest groups that  are protesting against sectarin policy or gerrymandering and thus creating a sense of impending war.  These will be small and localised but depending on how the economy goes, they will get worse or cease.  Joblessness is a major issue for Norn Iron.

-	-	Well, a lot of Americans associate "Christianity" with "virtue" and "love" and so forth.  The rest of them are either moronic Christians that associate it with war and so forth (~4%, maybe less now), or people that associate it with the Crusades, Catholic priest child molestation, and imperialism ("atheists").  Not to mention members of other religions in the U.S..  But the extent to which we believe "Christianity" should affect government - or just "religion" in government - is a very very vague question, just like you say.  I think politicians, if they're doing anything at all, should put goodwill and compassion into it, but irrationality is a whole different question.  The same thing is true there.  People associate Islam with peace.  That's why you always hear people saying, "Islam is a religion of peace," even if there are passages in the Koran that say things like "you go to heaven if you die defending the faith," and the more violent ones (not coming to mind right now).   There are passages like that in the Bible too, especially in the Old Testament, but that doesn't mean they define every part of Christianity.  I don't know if I would vouch for the numbers they give in that NPR piece, though.  2% for atheists seems very low.  Pew says 13.2%:  http://www.freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/Percentage_of_atheists#Atheists_In_America  but we've already talked about why Pew is not trustable at all in this thread.  This one says 15%:  http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/a/atheism/index.html?inline=nyt-classifie  Could be higher.  Who knows?  There are a whole bunch of Christians in this country.  But on an issue by issue breakdown, you really get to the meat of the question of what people want.  In America it's the same as it is there, people want freedom, and they know that the government doesn't give it to you - it only takes it away.
1	8	&gt;Campaigners fear the existing post-Mubarak transition programme – which would see September's ballot held under an amended version of Egypt's existing constitution and then allow members of parliament to oversee the writing of a new constitution – may cede permanent power to the Muslim Brotherhood and other religious groups, who are expected to dominate the pol  &gt;"I'm not expecting an outright Brotherhood victory or the creation of some kind of Iranian theocratic state, but clearly if the new parliament does not have adequate representation from the movements that played such a key part in sparking the revolution then that's a cause for concern."  This is worrying.    I agree that the last sentence might have some truth to it, but you can't simply dismiss it as a distraction, certainly not until the Egyptians have gone to the polling booths. You have to be mindful of coalitions and coalition agreements. In the UK, the Libdems, the third largest party are now in government with the Tories. This might occur in Egyptian politics. I'm not claiming it's going to be like the Taliban, but just that it's not quite the future everyone was hoping for.   The truth is neither of us know for sure if the concerns are founded until they've gone to the polls. 
0	1	Of course it matters. Human rights and just treatment of people should be important to us. 
0	2	It's because the "Islamists" are backed by the West.  Just like during the Iranian revolution, the U.S. is dying to put a dictator into place that'll quell any popular resentment of multinational corporations who will come in and strip all the natural resources from the country.  You know how "political scientists" have all that theory about "democracy" and how this is the "nth wave of democracy" in the Middle East?    That's all propaganda.  It's a platform for major European nations and America to export their brand of exploitation to countries they want to take the resources from.  The same thing is happening in Libya, except in reverse.  The U.S. didn't like Gaddafi, so they took whatever popular resentment they could dig up against him and tried to convert it into a coup d'etat against his government.  They lifted the sanctions for oil trading so that the revolutionaries could get rich, sent arms over there, and then bam, the revolutionaries set up a central bank, and already had a U.S. style McGovernment in place.  You still following me there, Fukuyama?  
-	-	A poll is data, which is more than the 'it will all work out nicely' crowd have. 
-	-	Irrelevant?
1	6	I totally see your point, especially from this part of the article. But the important part is the use of the words "may cede", especially when the MB themselves say: &gt; The Brotherhood's new political vehicle, the Freedom and Justice party, has vowed not to contest more than 50% of parliamentary seats and will not run a candidate for president in an effort to assuage concerns at home and abroad over a potential Islamist takeover of the state.  I guess I tend to agree with Wael Ghonim: &gt; "This is a waste of time," tweeted the pro-change campaigner and former Google executive Wael Ghonim, who argued that the constitution debate had descended into an ideological point-scoring contest in which neither side was willing to back down.  If the Left was serious about this, they would have started to write a constitution already, right now it's a lot of people trying to get a piece of the cake while their country is still under Military rule!
-	-	Well since zero muslim countries are at war with each other and the united states is sending its military against four muslim nations they might have a point.
1	4	Yes.  It is.  How much more proof could you possibly ask for?  You have two polls.  One of them says Egypt hates the idea of Islamist government, the other one says it loves it.  The second poll comes from an organization founded by the heirs to one of the largest oil companies on the planet.  Egypt has received 60 billion dollars in [U.S. military "aid"](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/29/us-egypt-usa-aid-idUSTRE70S0IN20110129) while Mubarak was dictator, for the last 40 YEARS.    Or do you just think all those brown skinned people are savages?  Is that your theory?
0	1	Poll rigging has been going wild for the last few months.  Support for Obama has disappeared, support for Ron Paul is what replaced it.  The media is dying to cover up this fact.  Literally, dying.  FOX News cannot survive in a free society, nor can MSNBC or CNN.
-	-	You cant in one breath say human rights must be guaranteed in egypt and then claim that the human rights violations of your own nation is irrelevant. Don't demand from others what you are unwilling to do yourself.
-	-	In your Gallup poll, 60% of Egyptians couldn't care one way or the other about the Muslim Brotherhood and 69% wanted religious leaders to have an advisory roll in governmental affairs.  The two poll results are not necessarily in conflict, just that the Pew one seems to be far more thorough in evaluating attitudes regarding the specifics of Sharia without touching on the politics of a specific organization.
1	6	All I said was that every country should be concerned about human rights and the treatment of people in other countries. I didn't say anything about the U.S. wars. Why are you conflating the two issues? 
1	8	Yes, when we are talking about Egypt, lets bring in the U.S. war in other nations other than Egypt.  He never said the U.S. was right, just that Egypt isn't exactly a hide out for reasonable non religious people.  he never said he agreed with our wars nor that they are just or humane  Stay on topic Asshats
-	-	I didn't. baldick did. You then dismissed them as irrelevant to the issue (Of concern for human rights) and I took issue with that. You can never say that war is irrelevant to the issue of human rights.
-	-	Then stop the unjust wars, kapische? 
1	7	i sort of agree with one sentence and disagree, strongly, with the next. throughout your post, that is.  i can't decide whether to upvote or to downvote (r/firstworldproblems)
-	-	&gt; a fact that most Redditors seemed to think wouldn't happen in a country that holds rather extreme religious views according to Pew polls.  This is naturally where your logic breaks down.  According to this poll support for the Muslim Brotherhood is only 15%:  http://patdollard.com/2011/06/gallup-15-of-egyptians-support-muslim-brotherhood-69-want-religious-leaders-to-have-advisory-role/  While only an astonishing 1% want Egypt to have an Islamist government:  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jun/5/poll-less-than-1-of-egyptians-favor-iran-style-isl/  They are sick of pseudo-moral pseudo-Islamism just like we're sick of pseudo-moral pseudo-Christian government.  They went out in the streets and protested because they wanted to be free.
-	-	You and the Pew polls. Stop with the propaganda. The Egyptian people didn't like the way they were governed, took to the streets, and now they are democratically electing their new leaders. What we think they should, or shouldn't, have is irrelevant. 
1	7	i hope not.  i hope the radical right doesn't exploit the religious to keep power in their hands by framing the debate of fair representative democracy, that's been so hard-fought for by progressives, to one of  gaining power over the masses by claiming moral superiority.    i hope they "don't get fooled again"... no, no.
-	-	People take notice of polls and surveys?
1	5	How can You hijack protests? By winning democratic elections?
-	-	dont count your chickens
0	2	Exactly, and that was my point, if you read the article carefully you'll know that the MB has not chance to take over Egypt, they will be part of a government just not the majority. The MB is used as a distraction from the current Military control of the economy. 
-	-	If you ask Americans if they think Christianity should have a role in government, [a lot of them](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4694428) will agree as well. If you then get more specific and ask if say, the Southern Baptist Convention should have an influence on the government, they will object.  You'll notice the same gap between the generic question about Islam having a role in government, and specific possible implementations.  It's fairly difficult to gauge people's views on highly emotional issues as the wording can effect things [tremendously](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-6198284-503544.html).
0	2	You're right, "terrorism" has replaced "communism" as the constantly changing, deathly horrible enemy that we supposedly need to raise taxes to defend ourselves against.  But in reality nothing has changed in the system itself.  In fact the military spending is still growing, despite the global call for peace that ended the Cold War.  I actually have huge reservations about Fukuyama.  The end of history is free market cryptoanarchy, not representative democracy.  What we call "democracy" is only a path towards the utter destruction of mankind.  Growing income/material inequality, militarization of the government against populations, suppression of all dissent, disease for profit, you name it.  When you give a group of representatives the power to reshape an economy, they WILL find people to sell the economy to.  If the people in charge oppose auctioning off the economy, and can be killed in secret, they will be, and always have been.  Above all the bullshit "left/right" "communism/fascism" theories in political science, that's the real truth.  The U.S. government absolutely wants an "Islamist" state in Egypt.  Not only does it keep the myth about "primitive Muslims" in the public consciousness, it allows the resources to keep flowing, as soon as they find some greedy people to take the reins.  That's why the military retained control after Mubarak resigned.
-	-	Please read the article before making such comment.  
-	-	You thought my point was that none of those things actually exist in Egypt?   Internet, your supply of aspies is neverending. 
0	2	&gt; Arab Spring Leaves Egypt In An Economic Slump  tourism has dropped, wow i wonder why.  could it have anything to do with the [secret police](http://the-classic-liberal.com/hosni-mubarak-agents-provocateur/) Mubarak sent around to terrorize his population?    &gt; Egypt's Political Transformation Moves Slowly  because the military is trying to choke the shit out of the country, mubarak stepped down but nobody else in his administration did.    why don't you take your head out of the U.S. media septic tank (NPR is better than MSNBC, CNN, and FOX, but not that much) for five minutes, go back to the top of this thread, and read what "petstorehero" wrote?  &gt; I just got back from visiting my family in Cairo. They were shocked when I talked about how American media portrays a "well now what do we do" feeling about what was going on over there.  &gt; On every corner my father was talking about the new shops that had gone up and the growing economy. Maadi especially, but places like Attamayah also and how still 5 months after the revolution there is a surging sense of civic pride.  new shops going up.  think about america.  what is the thing that's always stopping new stores from opening?  zoning laws, health permits, liquor licenses, taxes on businesses.  the government.  maybe in some places if you're unlucky, the police will just come to you and tell you they're going to shut you down without a bribe.  who's going to stop them?  "internal affairs"?  pfft.  there's such a crystal clear lesson we could all learn from Egypt about what a government actually it is - a group that lies about being beneficial for a society, when in reality it's strangling the society to make itself rich...
-	-	The political movement has already happened.  Now they are just separating into factions and trying to come up with a constitution/structure for their government.
0	2	the 504 is really fucking annoying, isn't it?
1	6	Wow. I can't believe you're getting upvotes. Pew are *very* reputable. Your arguments don't make any sense whatsoever. They consist entirely of [non-sequiters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur).  The lobbying isn't important: the question is lobbying in *what*.   On explaining the difference between the Pew attitudes poll and support for the Islamist parties poll: ultra-conservative attitudes *don't* necessarily translate into support for fundamentalist parties. This was observed in [Pew's Pakistan poll a few years ago](http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/07/30/pakistan_in_polling_vs_pakistan_in_practice).  &gt;..**the aforementioned findings seem to be contradicted by the reality on the ground**...Pakistani Muslims overwhelmingly welcome an Islamic influence over the country's politics, citizens continue to "consistently reject religious parties at the polls." **The alliance of Islamist parties** in Pakistan, the MMA, **was trounced at the 2008 polls**, managing to win only a miserable 2.2 percent of the vote.  &gt;**The framing of survey questions can help explain contradictory quantitative data.** In the case of the results generated in Pew's Religion, Law, and Society section of the survey, respondents were asked black-and-white questions, like, "Do you favor or oppose making stoning people who commit adultery the law in Pakistan?" According to Moeed Yusuf, a South Asia Advisor at the U.S. Institute of Peace, much of the so-called "Muslim World" find it difficult to go against anything seen as ordained by Islam. He added, "At an abstract level, Islam remains important to even the most secular of Muslims -- remember Islam is very candid about state and religion being an integrated whole (at least in the classic narrative) and so such questions would elicit such responses."  &gt;When faced with a choice between what they are supposed to say and what they actually practice, respondents tend to match abstract questions with equally abstract answers.  You are advised to read the entire article for a good rundown of why the results in Egypt might seemingly contradict support for fundamentalist parties. In fact, Foreign Policy's analysis explains the aberration that only 15% of Egyptians would vote for The Muslim Brotherhood but 69% want religious leaders in 'advisory roles' for government. Not your mish mash of non-sequiters.
1	4	The difference between you and me is that I'm dealing with facts and extrapolating from that, and you are simply hoping that what you would wish to happen, happens. This article is by a left wing paper and is stating that it seems likely according to liberals that the MB will gain power. I'm not sure where your argument is.  Oh and for the last time, I'm pro Arab spring. I think it's a good thing they got rid of the despot. I'm just a little concerned how it will turn out, as are the liberals in Egypt.

0	2	You've given this a little bit of a spin in the title (whilst being factually correct), focusing on the million strong protest rather than what it's actually about which is the likelihood that the Muslim Brotherhood will indeed get into power; a fact that most Redditors seemed to think wouldn't happen in a country that holds rather extreme religious views according to Pew polls. 
-	-	Im fairly conservative and I write for a fairly liberal peer reviewed academic political science journal. You would not believe the amount of heat I got when I dared suggest that Islamist could hijack the Egyptian protest. This is the biggest I told you so I've ever given.

0	2	Great news. I felt really uncomfortable with how prominent the Muslim brotherhood was in the protests. This revolution is for the people, not for Islam. 
0	1	I have a bad feeling Egyptians will soon have me making a U-turn and wishing they were still being oppressed rather than have to deal with yet another theocratic and/or religious looney bin like Iran, Pakistan, Saudi etc.

Muslims in Pakistan and Egypt are also the most supportive of ***whippings and cutting off of hands for crimes like theft and robbery***; 82% in Pakistan and ***77%*** in Egypt favor making this type of punishment the law in their countries, as do 65% of Muslims in Nigeria and 58% in Jordan. When asked about the ***death penalty for those who leave the Muslim religion***, at least three-quarters of Muslims in Jordan (86%), Egypt (***84%***) and Pakistan (76%) say they would favor making it the law; in Nigeria, 51% of Muslims favor and 46% oppose it.  They don't just have "extreme religious views", they're out of their fucking minds.   [Also, 95% of Egyptians think Islam should have a large influence in government.](http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1814/muslim-public-opinion-hamas-hezbollah-al-qaeda-islam-role-in-politics-democracy)  Just because "only" 15% supports the MB doesn't mean they're not all hoping for a goverment of religious maniacs. 
-	-	No its not relevant. We are talking about whether one country should care about how another government treats its citizens. We aren't talking about the US in any way. 
-	-	I'm pretty sure that people who support human rights in Egypt don't support the wars, *hevanta*?
1	6	The last paragraph of the article is actually the most interesting part: &gt;Some activists though have labelled the entire row an unnecessary distraction from the more important job of formulating new policies that tackle Egypt's many socio-economic problems and improve the condition of over 30 million Egyptians still living below the poverty line. "This is a waste of time," tweeted the pro-change campaigner and former Google executive Wael Ghonim, who argued that the constitution debate had descended into an ideological point-scoring contest in which neither side was willing to back down.  Love the use of the words "some activists", this really reinforces how unimportant these people are, therefore why should anyone care what they have to say.

0	1	that doesn't make sense!!! Islam is the most peaceful, loving, tolerant, religion. Furthermore, Muslims in Egypt have never ever engaged in any acts of violence or wide spread systematic discrimination against non Muslim Egyptians in the entire history of the country. If there should be any religion involved in the egyptian government its definitely Islam!!  silly egyptians 
1	4	I quoted the poll, but I have to admit that's a good bit of digging, and the bias of a source should always be taken into consideration. 
-	-	This shows how unorganized and divided the Left is. If they were really serious about establishing a Party, they would not be wasting time on trivial matters. Instead they should be writing a Constitution and run on it to win the upcoming elections.
-	-	From the article: &gt; The Brotherhood's new political vehicle, the Freedom and Justice party, has vowed not to contest more than 50% of parliamentary seats and will not run a candidate for president in an effort to assuage concerns at home and abroad over a potential Islamist takeover of the state.  It looks like the Army is going to push back the election as long as they can, and the MB is a great distraction, it's an easy political ball to throw around internally, and more importantly oversea. 
0	2	There have been a lot of crackdowns by the army and accusations of gross human rights violations. What can you tell me about that?
0	1	Sensationalist, agenda-driven, American media at its best.  They are attempting to portray any act of civil uprising as being a "bad idea" in the end.  They need to keep Americans complacent.  
0	1	Really? Would you consider NPR in this fashion? I've never known them to be sensationalist or agenda-driven. And despite petstorehero's anecdotal evidence, here are some recent articles from them that don't give such a rosy picture:  [Arab Spring Leaves Egypt In An Economic Slump](http://www.npr.org/2011/06/13/137008515/arab-spring-leaves-egypt-in-an-economic-slump)  [Egypt's Political Transformation Moves Slowly](http://www.npr.org/2011/06/13/137008515/arab-spring-leaves-egypt-in-an-economic-slump)  And NPR does good reporting, so I'm inclined to believe them over a single account. But I'm open to reading any well-sourced articles that say otherwise.

1	6	The global paradigm has shifted. Were not fighting the rooskies anymore. Secular states are the most important interest to the US democratic or not. The us wanting an Islamist state is absurd.  Edit: Fukayama is brilliant.

0	2	Well, a lot of Americans associate "Christianity" with "virtue" and "love" and so forth.  The rest of them are either moronic Christians that associate it with war and so forth (~4%, maybe less now), or people that associate it with the Crusades, Catholic priest child molestation, and imperialism ("atheists").  Not to mention members of other religions in the U.S..  But the extent to which we believe "Christianity" should affect government - or just "religion" in government - is a very very vague question, just like you say.  I think politicians, if they're doing anything at all, should put goodwill and compassion into it, but irrationality is a whole different question.  The same thing is true there.  People associate Islam with peace.  That's why you always hear people saying, "Islam is a religion of peace," even if there are passages in the Koran that say things like "you go to heaven if you die defending the faith," and the more extreme ones (not coming to mind right now).   There are passages like that in the Bible too, especially in the Old Testament.  I don't know if I would vouch for the numbers they give in that NPR piece, though.  2% for atheists seems very low.  Pew says 13.2%:  http://www.freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/Percentage_of_atheists#Atheists_In_America  but we've already talked about why Pew is not trustable at all in this thread.

1	5	There were lots of discussions about the recent rape tests that were given to a group of women, in the same manner that we might discuss the most recent political sex scandal.  I can say that there is not a sense of fear among the general public, or if there is the excitement far outweighs the trepidation.  
1	4	Ah so it's a sinister conspiracy, is it? Good to know. 
0	3	Strange that there's such a big disparity between our polls, huh?  Something's off here.  I'm so used to rigged polling organizations I started looking up Pew.  The first thing I noticed is that the "Pew Charitable Trusts" have 5 BILLION dollars in assets, and are spending 5-20% of that money on LOBBYING efforts;  https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Pew_Charitable_Trusts  The only lead I got was to this webpage:  http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/funderProfile.asp?fndid=5213  which is broken, as you can see.  So I went to the Google cache of it (here's a copy):  http://hpaste.org/48247  and found out that the Pews who started the foundation were the heirs to, you guessed it, Sunoco Oil:  http://everything.explained.at/Sunoco/    Alarm bells should be going off in your head at this point.  Why would a polling foundation founded by the heirs to an oil company spend 5-20% of its money on lobbying?  Or ANY of its money on lobbying?  And why would it also lie about the source and nature of political instability in Egypt, an oil and gas-rich country?  I don't know.  Oil?  Maybe gas, too?   http://www.biggamefishingjournal.com/pew_hutch_article.html  Everything in this country unravels if you look at it closely enough.  Everything.  Sunoco, as you can see from the "everything explained" link, has purchased the rights to Mobil and is the official fuel of NASCAR.  The article also notes:  &gt; Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have identified Sunoco as the 55th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, with roughly 1.7 million pounds of toxic chemicals released annually into the air.[2] Major pollutants indicated by the study include nickel compounds, naphthalene, aniline, and benzene.

1	4	That's rather alarmist.
-	-	your statement makes it sound like we currently have faith in government and social institutions. I honestly believe we (Americans) are too lazy/a tad bit ignorant to revolt.
-	-	We are currently perched on an energy precipice, and not the good kind  Cheap oil is running low and the alternatives are rather lackluster  
0	2	Maybe from now on we should just get updates on days when there *aren't* mass rapes in the congo.
0	1	Ah, Africa! So majestic, so beautiful........so fucked up. 
-	-	Business as usual in Congo, say aid groups and local media
-	-	This isn't really new. This has been going on for many years there.
0	3	what is wrong with people? this breaks my heart... where is the UN? where is help for these and so many other people? 
0	3	Maybe we should just mass ship to these women the sort of one-shot wonders we supplied the french maquis with in WW2 and see how rapists rape with a sucking chest wound.
0	1	And America isn't invading like they did in Libya, why, NO OIL!  FUCK AMERICAN IMPERIALISM!
1	6	why is this news? This is a daily thing in many African countries. no one will ever be able to do anything about  it

0	5	a sad, ugly world we live in, huh?
1	8	Rebels need love too.
-	-	DRC is extremely mineral rich with Oil, gold, diamonds and timber. With Libya there was a clearly defined opposition and a clearly defined aggressor. When we intervened in Libya it was clear who would be in charge after the dust settled. In the DRC, it isn't so clear and because of that it is hard to intervene without committing yourself there for a LONG time. 
-	-	I had to look up french maquis thinking it was a weapon, but as it turns out, they were [armed resistance fighters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maquis_%28World_War_II%29). TIL
0	5	I weep for Africa, but kind of assume we'll be in the same place in the next twenty years, or so.
0	5	HELL YEAH. This is what I've been saying too! When there are so many atrocities in the world that have been going on for so long, it is hella deceptive and self-serving for us to claim moral superiority by attaching some kind of ethical imperative to our invasion of Libya. 
1	6	who is we? and what would cause it?
-	-	I take it you're not a DS9 fan
-	-	*We* would be most of the computer using world.  And the what will be economic collapse, loss of faith in government and social institutions, followed by mass chaos.
-	-	deep space 9?! I'm not sure I follow...

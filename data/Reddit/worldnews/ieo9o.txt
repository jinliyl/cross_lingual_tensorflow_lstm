They're not hamstrung by short-term election cycles and think 20, 30, or 40 years down the road. Economic and political opportunities are being bought on the cheap.  They're investing in Africa for this reason, too. They're locking in land and resource deals now, while it's cheap.  Our governments? Not so forward thinking.

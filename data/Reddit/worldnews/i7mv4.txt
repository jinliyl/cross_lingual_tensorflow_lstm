1	6	It's hard to take, I don't wanna believe it either.  Wish I knew why they were doing this, and who "they" is....
-	-	I'm in Beijing right now (Chaoyang District) and there is absolutely no flooding today. At all. Anywhere. Beijing isn't really THAT huge of a city, and it's a clear day right now - and has been for a while.  Given that this was posted up yesterday, I will say that, yes, there was a crazy storm here, but that degree of flooding would have shut down the subways and hit news all over the place. And some of those pictures have really, REALLY deep water - they look more like they're from the southern provinces and the flooding they recently experienced.  So...what the hell are you talking about? I don't think I could miss news this big.
0	5	im in beijing right now. It was really crazy. at 3pm, the sky was the darkest ive ever seen, completely black. The rain was so intense that parts of the office roof collapsed and water got everywhere. big fuckin mess, ive never seen such a flood in a short time like this. it lasted about 30minutes
0	1	From the pictures it look as though no one seems to give a fuck.

1	7	My heart goes out to everyone out there. Keep strong.
-	-	Story from China Daily about the rain in Beijing: http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-06/24/content_12764690.htm  Another article with videos and photos: http://storyful.com/stories/1000004793  More photos: http://www.chinasmack.com/2011/pictures/torrential-rains-flood-beijing-subways-and-forbidden-city.html   For the skeptics, see the pics of the cars with the äº¬ license plates. No self-respecting Beijinger would take their superexpensive cars all the way south.
-	-	Where is the video? 
-	-	China's rapid industrialization has come at a severe environmental expense. It appears it is a bit too late to try any remedial measures. China's desertification is happening at an alarming rate and coupled with its deforestation rate, there are lesser trees to absorb the water. This will be normal as time goes on.
-	-	Where is the video?
-	-	Frash frood?
-	-	my dad is filming in beijing right now... are you all safe there?

1	6	&gt; I don't think I could miss news this big.    [Apparently you did.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i7mv4/flash_flood_hits_beijing/c21m9mh)  Even the Forbidden City got inundated.
1	6	huh? so where are all the pictures and videos from... ?
-	-	Frash frood.
-	-	This doesn't say anything about Beijing - the story was filed there, but it's about Haima hitting South China. Beijing is in northern China.
-	-	i dont believe in this but the first thing i thought when it happened was that! 
0	2	it smelled like shit for 2 days as the sewers overflowed but that's about it. you couldnt tell it happened now.

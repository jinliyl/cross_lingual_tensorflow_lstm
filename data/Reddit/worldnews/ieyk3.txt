1	4	As long as you give me a battery as well. I like going outside when the sun shines. :)  Now, get in that HazMat suit, Poindexter.
1	4	Exactly. They weren't designed to withstand exactly what was very likely to hit them. Cutting corners to save money.   Not so bad with a wind turbine, deadly with a nuke.
-	-	Really? Was it not clear? Probable death by radiation or certain death by bullet. Choose one.
1	4	Hell, I'm a multi-millionaire in yen.  I could even buy, like, a small car with my savings, maybe.   
-	-	well, they're paying $400 a day - what are you offering?
-	-	&gt;certain death  O hyperbole, though striketh again!  But Tomohiko Suzuki is a pretty cool guy.
-	-	not too difficult to be a millionaire in yen.
-	-	artistic 
-	-	Probable death by radiation? Hyperbole much? They're still bound by the radiation limits.
1	8	Sorry to be crass, but SOMEBODY has to do it. I don't think it's realistic to expect other countries to send their workers in, because no one in their right mind would want to go near there. I'm not saying this is right, but at this stage ANYBODY will do. I've been in the army. They say... "We need some volunteers... You, you and YOU!" Chernobyl was fixed in the same way and maybe this is what is required here. 
1	6	What happened to the retired engineers who were offering to go in?
-	-	That is a great use of poor people! Remember people are not an endangered species!
-	-	Japanese nuclear power companies have a long history of using glow-slaves supplied by the yakuza
-	-	$400/day?  Where do I sign!!!!
-	-	*can't...take...name...seriously*
1	6	What do **rights groups** know about anything?
-	-	This is where the directors, managers, and other responsible people should change into HazMat suits, get a crash course in customs regarding handling nuclear stuff and go in themselves. This is their responsibility, this is why they got paid millions, now they have to show why they were worth that much.
-	-	From what I've read about the working conditions, someone in their 60s or 70s would not be able to cope. Massive heat and humidity being the biggest problems.
1	4	well those who are poor are more likely to work in such dangerous conditions than someone who could work for more money in a safer environment. i dont see a problem
1	4	Yah, and they're being excellent pay in a country with excellent medical care...This a good option for these people.
1	4	People who should be doing that work before a vulnerable minority group does:  * TEPCO management * TEPCO board members * Japan's nuclear regulators * Japan's elected officials  Once you run out of those people, TEPCO shareholders -- the real owners of the company -- are much more appropriately next in line to face consequences for what their company did. They took the dividends and capital gains in the good years - now gypsies die to clean up the mess?
-	-	In a fair and sane world those execs (and complicit engineers) who decided to cut all the corners that caused the catastrophe would be forced in to their HazMat suits - at gunpoint if necessary.  And if I was World Emperor, I'd round up a bunch of nuke shills from reddit who are still yapping that nukes are clean and safe and send them in as well.
-	-	they got paid millions?  
-	-	LOL... Fair enough... I can go with that. 
-	-	Governor Wallace, is that you?
-	-	I think he doesn't understand that Japan operates differently than America.
-	-	Except you know, the certain death angle, and not being able to take advantage of that excellent pay when they're dead.
-	-	Cut corners?  They weren't designed in the first place to survive an earthquake of that magnitude AND a tsunami.
-	-	If I was world emperor, I would cut you off the electricity grid and gave you a solar panel. So you could spread your vile stupid shit on the internet only when the sun shines.

-	-	And we all know that if wasn't for China and Russia on the Security Council that NATO would be in there kicking ass. When did NATO become such a club of weasels?
0	1	Hey look, 4 comments!  This is still not as interesting as the Israeli government being so horrible as to link to a hoax video about gay rights.  Not nearly as interesting as a link about Israeli traffic lights supposedly discriminating Palestinians.  The number of "Fuck Israel" calls every little anti-Israeli article makes /r/worldnews is staggering, and pretty ridiculous that none of these people seem to care about real humanitarian crisis when they happen.
-	-	Let's be honest here, NATO is pretty stretched thin here with the most important members of the alliance using their resources to fight elsewhere. I doubt even if china and russia became pro western democracies tomorrow we still would'nt be able to drop any bombs.
-	-	Can we send in the AC130s now for some humanitarian action?  
-	-	Are Russia and China dropping bombs anywhere? Those two have some pretty nice arsenals. I am sure if they joined the party there would be some significant dropping happening. 
0	1	It's doing a great job in afgha...oh wait. And the libyan intervention has spiralled out of control. Nato is now arming the same groups it is fighting elsewhere. A real clusterfuck, lets make it flare up even more!

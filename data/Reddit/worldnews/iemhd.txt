-	-	Excellent article.   Another reputable Japanese authority lending credence to what most Japanese people seem to feel: the private power industry and its political lackeys for the last 40 years have sold out Japan.    From the article: “Japan, with its history of having suffered radiation exposure from the atomic bombs, should have the most [direct] knowledge of radiation, but in fact, in the approach to the nuclear accident, has simply fallen into confusion.”  He places blame on a number of groups:  TEPCO executives, who he accuses of having hidden the truth and prioritized the survival of the company over public health.  Bureaucrats who were unable to put together an accurate body of information about radiation effects from which to formulate policy.  A prime minister and cabinet lacking both leadership and an appropriate sense of urgency.  Politicians who sought to use the crisis in intra- or inter-party struggles.  Nuclear industry lobbyists and “academic flunkies” (goyo gakusha) of the government who built up the myth of nuclear safety in the first place."  Japan will have a Green Party soon.   It will find more support than in the U.S. only because of one calamity.   
1	4	And such a calamity it is. I find this relieving. There is a huge shortage of people willing to actually consider the potential severity of this disaster, however, this is an article addressing only the human cost. I would also like to see some authority figures address the environmental cost as well. I can only hope that the consequences of this disaster won't be buried in time and controversy. 
1	4	I've gotta wonder, though: why sour on the whole concept of nuclear power? Ok, it seems that due to a culture of cronyism and respecting authority over being right, the earthquake and tsunami caused very severe problems. But there are other, newer, more secure nuclear power plants that survived just fine. The current disaster throws light on government incompetence and corruption, it's not like nuclear power is "evil" or inherently more dangerous than burning hydrocarbons (environmental degradation), hydroelectric power (earthquakes can damage dams and cause catastrophic flooding), etc. The problem here is an incompetent, corrupt, self-serving government, not how Japan is powered. The fact that it happened to be through neglect of nuclear safety that Japan's government screwed its people seems incidental, if it hadn't been this it would have been something else.
1	6	The whole thing is really just tragic. What's even more tragic is that, here in America, there is absolutely no coverage of it on TV. Barely anyone here even knows whats going on over there. I'm afraid that no one here will learn anything from this. I can remain hopeful, but it looks as though nothing is going to change. 
1	4	Japan has such a rich and diverse geography that more native species of trees are found in the relatively very small Japanese archipelago than in the rest of the northern non tropical hemisphere.  It is so naturally abundant that the indigenous Yayoi people were the first people in the world to develop pottery.  Why that's surprising is because like North America's Pacific northwest the indigenous people developed complex civilizations without agriculture. I own a very small piece of that land.  You can dig down with only your hand easily for meters and find only rich loam.  That the LDP allowed that rich natural heritage to be irradiated by incompetence and corruption, contracting with GE while at the same time taking millions of dollars from the CIA, is an ecological crime of historic proportions.  Such betrayal by corporate interests is not unique to Japan and that to me is really what Americans should take away from this and what hopefully the Japanese people will find an arena in which to find some justice and recompense.

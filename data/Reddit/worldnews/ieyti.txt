0	1	&gt; Here, for this case, there is no need for anonymity, nothing is at stake for the informant.  the source has said "the maid got the job at the Midtown hotel because her union “saw her as an earner.” "  so basically he accuses his bosses (and the whole fucking industry, basically) of running a prostitution ring and you're saying nothing is at stake. are you fucking crazy??  &gt; Secondly, even if she worked as a prostitute, that is no reason to disregard the rape charges.  yes it is, especially if it's a "he said - she said" situation and she discussed how she's gonna cash in on it because "he's rich and I know what I'm doing"
-	-	you called me a retard?.... did you get that info from an "anonymous source?"
-	-	[deleted]
-	-	My point was that the source is unidentified while the refutation is on the record.  For all we know, this reporter made the source up. We have no idea, and considering it's the NY Post, I take what they say with a grain of salt.  The fact that the rest of the media is repeating a story about an unnamed source making outrageous accusations blows my mind.
-	-	my comment was "idiotic?"... is that biased?   or is that factual?
0	1	&gt; My point was that the source is unidentified while the refutation is on the record.  and my point is  that you have no point. their statement means absolutely nothing (unless you're so fucking naive that you expect corrupt criminal organizations to fucking indict themselves)  &gt; For all we know, this reporter made the source up.  well, everything they're saying makes perfect sense and fits into the bigger picture.  but others will be looking into it and I'm sure there will be a publication with enough credibility for you. 
0	1	&gt; it's from a single source   man, I'm sure you could find more than one knowledgeable guy from that hotel who would be willing to talk. the management would just hand you over the list of employees and you would make those people expose their bosses and risk their careers for fucking nothing because **you** are so fucking awesome.   please report back to us tomorrow about your progress!  &gt; which provided no corroborating evidence.  like pictures of other powerful world leaders getting blowjobs from her? or signed, official pimping contracts? that would help? man, I guess I'll just email the UN and they'll start collecting corroborating evidence for you!  I'm kind of getting tired of the stupidity of /r/worldnews :/ 
-	-	&gt;well, everything they're saying makes perfect sense and fits into the bigger picture  That's actually what makes me suspect it as being false. It's the way it's presented and the fact it's from a single source which provided no corroborating evidence.
-	-	Ok, I missed this detail about the defense investigation informant, I'll give you that. (even though DSK's attorneys have the best reputation and wouldn't risk it for this, IMO)  But the shoe still fits and, as I said, other people will look into it now to confirm it. Meanwhile, let's not set impossible standards for journalists. 
-	-	They didn't quote someone from the hotel. They ran the story on a single, uncorroborated source who, supposedly, is a DSK insider and therefore an extremely biased source.  That's not journalism. How do you take that at face value?
-	-	So here's what I remember ahaving heard about her:   * talked on the phone to someone in prison shortly before the incident  * received 100K from him   * worked as prostitute  * illegal immigrant  * exploiting her own people  * demon horns under her wig  I don't know if all that stuff is true, but it's almost comical what is piled upon her.  
-	-	Anonymous sources attacking her, as published in the *New York Post*.  That has even less credibility than she's alleged to have.  Subby, do you get your news from You-tube comments?
-	-	haha! perfect comment!....  i am thinking of becoming an "anonymous source" myself!.... i feel i could flip turn the world upside down with some of my "info"
1	4	this and the taped phone conversation with her pimp where she discussed the possibility of cashing in on the situation settles it for me   she also returned to clean this and another room before reporting the "crime" to her supervisor, and then lied about this.  and i'm glad i don't have to reevaluate my judgement of people, because [this guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIODU4nQZA)'s not a rapist. 
-	-	I agree her credibility is shot, but this reeks of a hit piece. She doesn't even belong to the union that's supposedly her pimp.  If you actually read the whole article (not just the headline), you'll see it's an unnamed source who's contradicted by an on-the-record union official.
-	-	yes, this is how quality journalism is done. the best journalists have always been relying on insider informants and protected their identities.  and why would the New York Post defend a leftist Frenchman by fabricating information, you brainless moron?  
0	1	Stop calling the people at the NY Post "journalism." It's a fucking tabloid.
-	-	first you gotta convince a journalist that you know what you're talking about, retard.  because journalists are protecting their sources' identities but their sources are known to them. 
0	1	&gt; She doesn't even belong to the union that's supposedly her pimp.  that's irrelevant. the accusation is that somebody had selected her as an "earner"  &gt; who's contradicted by an on-the-record union official  why, what the fuck did you expect??? "yes, sir, we're hiring and promoting personell that's willing to suck cock. that's what we do. that's how the system works."  
-	-	It should definitely be investigated, and frankly, my first reaction to this whole thing was that it sounded fishy. Still, I just got the overwhelming feeling that the Post article was a hit piece.
-	-	Yes, no. In extraordinary cases, it makes sense. Most of the time, it is sheer laziness. Here, for this case, there is no need for anonymity, nothing is at stake for the informant.  Secondly, even if she worked as a prostitute, that is no reason to disregard the rape charges. Just because prostitutes accept money to have sex at times is no reason to assume they do so all the time.

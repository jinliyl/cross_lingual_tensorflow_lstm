1	4	Ahhh, thank you for clearing that up  :)
-	-	No, that would be Mexican Policia.
-	-	In the US it's called the war on drugs.  A sleazy metaphor for needless investment in endless law enforcement and spying on our citizens.
1	4	I don't believe you understand *context* or have reasoning.  If I say good work as I did in the sentence, I would assume people would think I am saying good work to the good guys, not the bad. So, "Good for them" translates to, "Good for the marines, no deaths and the message is sent." The marines had no deaths and they sent the message, which I think is crystal clear. You might have a little trouble, but I'm willing to help you out if you need it.
-	-	Can't tell if trolling.. or naive... 
1	4	I figured that "good work" would mean they could arrest the suspects without violence.  This is just "work."
-	-	People shouldn't be congratulated for doing the job they are expected to do.  They should be congratulated if they somehow perform *above* expectations.
-	-	TIL there are Mexican Marines.
-	-	15 high paying job openings created, right there.  Mexico's recovery is underway!
-	-	Good work for them, no deaths and the message is sent.
-	-	They probably used stim packs.
-	-	I dunno man, I hear them pension plans can be cut short
-	-	Now that's what I call a drug war.
-	-	Mexican Marines = rival cartel members.
-	-	They say Oooolleeeeee instead of Hooooraaaah.
-	-	It's what everybody calls a drug war.
-	-	Fifteen people died. Or does "kill" mean something different nowadays.

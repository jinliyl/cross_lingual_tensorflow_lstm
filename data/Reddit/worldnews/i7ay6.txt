0	2	Does 'nuke site' mean 'nuclear missile site' to just me?  Seriously, calling a nuclear power plant a 'nuke site' seems to indicate a level of bias.
1	4	Oh yeah? Well... COAL !!! Also, bananas! By the way, causation is not correlation. I don't know what that means but I saw someone say it on /r/science and I thought it was a good argument.
-	-	&gt;calling a nuclear power plant a 'nuke site' seems to indicate a level of bias.  or it might indicate a desire, or need, on the part of the headline writer to come in under a specific number of characters.
-	-	And 100% of coal mines. so?
-	-	Difference being the radiation from coal pales in comparison to the radiation from nuclear power plants. I quote:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel_power_station  &gt;The collective radioactivity resulting from all coal burning worldwide between 1937 and 2040 is estimated to be 2,700,000 curies or 0.101 EBq.  2.700.000 curie released by coal in its global history.   But now Fukushima and Chernobyl:  &gt;ROBERT ALVAREZ [former senior policy adviser to the U.S. Secretary of Energy]: Yes. As you know, the Japanese government, in its report to the IAEA, said it had underestimated the amount of radioactivity released to the atmosphere during the first week and that it amounts to roughly 40 million curies of radioactivity. What they failed to mention is that they discharged an equally large amount into the ocean, about 20 million curies, and that the—what they’re counting here is the radioactive iodine and radioactive cesium.  &gt;*[T]he Soviet Union and Russia basically have claimed that about 50 million curies of radioactivity were released to the environment*  In other words Chernobyl alone released 20 times the amount of radiation all coal plants globally will released until 2040.    **TL;DR: The "coal is radioactive too" argument is bullshit.**

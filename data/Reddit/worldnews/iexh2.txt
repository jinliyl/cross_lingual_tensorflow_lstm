-	-	this wasn't slavery. they were paid. upfront.   now they go back to their village and go to bed hungry. at least they had work.  
-	-	"The owner of the brick kiln was held and released."
-	-	I have $250,000 for you, upfront, to come work at my brick kiln.
-	-	made his payment then
-	-	i can feed myself. if i was a married guy and could not feed my kids, i'd happily work there. what else is a man to do?  i am from india.
-	-	So the fact they can't live isn't a violation of liberty ?  Do you suppose that children can enter into labor contracts on their own, seeing how they had children working in the kilns.
1	4	&gt;maybe the children were living with their parents...  Even better, just like the old Libertarian Confederacy.  Your parents were slaves and so will you be a slave.  It's a shame the Federal government of India interrupted such freedom.
-	-	maybe the children were living with their parents. the report never says that they were made to work. its written for maximum propaganda without without telling an absolute lie.  
-	-	You misunderstand me. If the workers wanted to go free, they should have the freedom to do so. But why should the kiln be closed? If they were beaten etc, there is no reason why the owner could not mend his ways and stop doing that. In any case, as I said, this is being used for propaganda purposes.   
-	-	owner didn't pay his bribes on time I see
-	-	I think if someone had said "500 slaves rescued from _working_ in brick kilns" it would be a less sensationalistic headline.
-	-	B..B..but libertarianism says that slavery isn't economical...
-	-	By some measures, there are more slaves on earth than there ever have been before.
-	-	Slavery was only abolished in Mauritania in [2007....](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/06/the-country-where-slavery-is-still-normal/241148/) Plenty slaves still there. Since it was abolished (again) there have been [no prosecutions for slavery.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Mauritania)
-	-	there was a UK documentary recently about slaves labour at brick kilns in China. Much of it followed a father trying to find his physically strong but mentally impaired son who had been kidnapped to work in a brick factory. It was heart breaking. i cant find a link to the full programme bu [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmBHNwD_nRg) is a clip, and [here](  http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/documentary) is an article.
-	-	I think you're giving CNN too much credit for effective editing. They probably didn't even realize the double entendre. 
1	4	Forced bonded labor? Sounds like a Libertarian paradise to me.
1	4	Exactly. The entire clip was about how good the government was too. 
-	-	"500 slaves rescued from working in a place where they used kilns to make bricks"

1	7	I hope the jury that found him not guilty can sleep at night.  BTW - When a link shows random facebook posts, you really get a look into the wacky world of humanity.
-	-	I knew it!
0	1	I fucking knew he did it.
-	-	Bunch of black activists crying racism back in '94 gonna be looking at their shoes and avoiding interviews today...
-	-	Now it says Oprah's rep has denied the report.
-	-	No, he didn't.  http://www.nesn.com/2011/06/oj-simpson-confession-reports-denied-by-oprah-winfreys-representative.html
-	-	wtf is this doing in /r/worldnews?
-	-		&gt; Simpson claimed he stabbed Nicole in self-defense.  * yea right ...
0	2	Yeah, we all knew he did it, but the news here is that he finally admitted to it. What bothers me, though, is that he's probably going to make money out of his admission by appearing on shows and selling the story.
0	2	We're all innocent in here, didn't you know that ?
-	-	More importantly, OJ stays true to his promise to find the killer at all costs.
-	-	And in other news, sky is in fact blue, water wet.
0	2	So the cops framed a guilty man?  
-	-	I've known that since 1994...
-	-	This belongs in r/noshitsherlock
-	-	Reported to be false http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/23/oprah-oj-simpson-confessi_n_883066.html
1	8	To be fair, this article says he claims he stabbed her in self defense which isn't exactly him admitting to murder.
1	8	American Justice.
-	-	suddenly a lot of people owe me back money on a bet... IGNORE ME!!!
0	1	Clearly the poor guy is being framed again. Why can't he just get some justice?
1	6	&gt;Simpson confessed to a producer for Oprah Winfrey, and he will reportedly repeat the confession to Winfrey during a televised interview.   He's probably going to make money out of it. 
1	4	He must need money for commissary.  I hear Top Ramen is getting pretty expensive in the joint.
0	3	He did promise he'd find the killer. Nailed it.
1	6	Self defense? Then why did he kill Goldman?
0	2	&gt;Simpson claimed he stabbed Nicole in self-defense.  Cue scumbag meme: Confess to crime; Keep lying about it
-	-	But he can't be tried again, even after a confession, under the protection of the fifth amendment, right?
0	1	&gt;Simpson claimed he stabbed Nicole in self-defense.        Fuck that shit - her head was almost decapitated!  If you've ever seen the pictures or read the description of the scene, it was a vicious murder.
0	5	I'm sorry, did I miss something? I thought Oprah retired and the show went off the air?  Wasn't that what all the hoopla was about, a month or so ago?  There was a great deal of it, the hoopla.
-	-	This only happened in Oprah's dreams.  Quoted [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/oprahs-goal-for-own-i-have-a-dream-of-oj-simpson-confessing-to-me/2011/06/16/AGUvorXH_story.html).
-	-	[Hollywood Reporter is refuting the story](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oprah-hasnt-landed-oj-simpson-205028)
-	-	Yes, but she has her OWN channel now.
1	8	He'll have a hard time keeping the money he makes.  He still owes the Goldman family for the wrongful death lawsuit as well as any monetary penalty he received for this robbery.
0	3	The jury was sequestered and not allowed to see the same evidence we saw.  The prosecution did a horrible job. 
1	4	Yea, right. Like there was ever any doubt.
1	6	&gt; I hope the jury that found him not guilty can sleep at night.  Why shouldn't they. The prosecution failed to **prove beyond reasonable doubt**...

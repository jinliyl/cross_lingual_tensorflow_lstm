1	4	&gt; However it would explain very well part of the 100,000$ found on her account and her telephone bills.  There are lots of other ways to explain the $100K.   The evidence so far is that it is drug money laundered by others into her account.    She seems to be uneducated and naive and, to put it succinctly, an amoral bottom-dwelling survivor.    It does't make much sense for a maid to continue working as a maid if she had actual access to the money, rather than simply had an account opened in her name.  &gt; Well specific isn't the word as during the interview, she is extremely vague about the circumstances of the alleged assault attempt.  Doesn't sound *that* vague:  &gt; Banon: "For my first book I had to interview people about their biggest mistake...he didn't really answer but suggested we meet again. He asked me to come to his hotel... he asked me to hold his hand while recording the interview, and then he kept on trying to touch other parts of my body... I was wearing a black turtle neck... we fought on the floor... he sent me an sms after saying: do I scare you?" ... It ended really badly. We ended up fighting. It finished really violently." "We fought on the floor. It wasn't a case of a couple of slaps. I kicked him, he unhooked my bra, he tried to open my jeans." He acted like a "horny monkey." "I said the word 'rape' to scare him but it didn't seem to scare him much, which suggests he was used to it."  .  &gt; Okay, so let's wait for the trial before talking of "evidence", then.  Why shouldn't we talk about it?   We can mention the source, and the fact that it isn't confirmed by the prosecution (who have some obligations to stay out of the media to avoid tainting the trial).  
-	-	&gt;Her history is fair game to discredit her,  Her STORY, and the physical evidence available is fair game to discredit her.  Of course her history is fair game is she's mentally unstable.
-	-	No, that's evidence of sex.  Evidence of rape would have to somehow show that the sex wasn't consensual.  Neither semen nor bruising do that. On top of that, the bruising "evidence" was found weeks after the incident. There is no way to prove that she did not receive that bruising sometime between the incident and the time the evidence was discovered.
-	-	No, it's physical evidence of sex. And for the bruisings, they have not been examined in court yet. Nothing says they were caused during the alleged rape.
1	4	Well, all this shows is that many people were happy when the news broke out, and were enthusiastically spreading it. No surprise here.  And even the prosecution must have seen this as an easy opportunity for a career boost.  Still, no right wing conspiracy. Way too amateurish; the lady was just way too stupid (she was cleaning two other rooms after the alleged rape, for Peter's sake!)
1	4	No, my point was that just because she has a history of lying does not mean she was NOT raped.  Just because DSK has been accused of rape in the past does not mean he's raped anyone here.  Her case is falling apart, and you're still beating the drum for his head.  Quit being so emotionally invested in his guilt and admit there are no lines between which you can magically read and determine what he's likely to have done or not.   Innocent until proven guilty you communist.
1	4	Sure, this is a valid approach if you have a data set as input to build your chain, and another data set to validate your approach. Where will you get such a (known good) data set?  As I said previously (although not very prominently), there is no way to verify the validity and as long as humans will lie to avoid punishment, there will never be a way. A good approach would be proper characterisation, i.e. full psychological profiling with an accuracy etc that is beyond today's techniques and understanding.  Let me clarify my beliefs here: that there is nothing wrong with Bayesian methods, but there is a problem with implementing it in this case. I agree that there are many problems with how law is applied, what the courts consider to be logic etc. We should strive to make the system better, and I don't see how statistics can work in this case.
1	4	&gt; Eyewitness testimony is hideously unreliable  Yes, this is well known and has been for centuries, not just since someone compiled statistics and drew a graph.  &gt; As for physical evidence, this too can be faked  Absolutely.  Sometimes the forgeries can be exposed.  Sometimes innocent people are convicted on forgeries.  And sometimes, the defence can use the spectre of a forgery and a wrongful conviction to create reasonable doubt.  Or the prosecution can use the spectre of a slimy crafty defence lawyer trying to fool everyone to get his guilty client off the hook to shore up problems in its case.  &gt; The fact that the accused has had previous accusations conveys more statistical knowledge.  I'm not saying that it isn't probative evidence, but it derails the object of the trial.  The question isn't whether he did it before, but if he did it this time.  A serial car thief may not have stolen *this* particular car.  There's a human desire to punish bad people.  If the accused is shown to be a bad person, then a jury is more likely to convict, regardless of direct evidence of the particular crime in issue.
-	-	That's how the system is supposed to work. Burden on the prosecution and all that. And with rape cases usually being he said/she said, the prosecution needs to be able to show that the alledged victim is trustworthy.
-	-	[link](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/world/europe/17fund.html)  &gt;  A person with direct knowledge of Ms. Nagy’s version of what happened and her view of the I.M.F. investigation said that the affair — which was conducted at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland — was consensual, but that she had felt coerced because Mr. Strauss-Kahn was so forceful and so senior to her, making it hard for her to, in effect, say no. ...  she went on to say that Mr. Strauss-Kahn was “a man with a problem that may make him ill-equipped to lead an institution where women work under his command.”  [link](http://mobile.salon.com/news/feature/2011/05/17/imf_head_assault_2/index.html)  &gt; An employee who had a brief affair with IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn warned the organization about his behavior toward women [plural] in a letter sent three years ago, a person close to her said Tuesday. ...

[link](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/16/dominique-strauss-kahn-tristane-banon) [in addition to Banon]  &gt; Thierry Saussez, a former adviser to Sarkozy, who took part in the TV show with Banon, said: "All this stupefaction from people is sheer hypocrisy. Everyone in Paris has known for years he had something of a problem. *Not many female journalists are prepared to interview him alone these days.*"  [link](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/16/dominique-strauss-khan-arrest-france)  &gt;  Christophe Deloire and Christophe Dubois, broke a taboo in their 2006 book, Sexus Politicus, about politicians' sexual behaviour. They wrote of Strauss-Kahn's tendency to "seduction to the point of obsession", mentioning, but not naming, female journalists who had been irritated by his gestures towards them. They also referred to one senior civil servant who didn't take up his offer to "come up to his office to relax".  &gt; The Socialist party MP Aurelie Filipetti recalled a "very heavy, very pressing" come-on to her by Strauss-Kahn. She said that afterwards: "*I made sure I never ended up alone with him in a closed space.*"     
-	-	Sure, but don't they have an obligation to not discriminate their potential clients?  A restaurant owner can't pick and choose who they serve.  That's illegal and immoral.
1	4	Banon: "It ended really badly. We ended up fighting. It finished really violently." "We fought on the floor. It wasn't a case of a couple of slaps. I kicked him, he unhooked my bra, he tried to open my jeans." He acted like a "horny monkey." "I said the word 'rape' to scare him but it didn't seem to scare him much, which suggests he was used to it."   That's not attempted rape?
-	-	next time i should rape pathological liars, cause no one will believe them!  maybe we should go with facts, if it does end up being a he said, she said situation where all the evidence were somehow irrelevant then she would basically lose the trial.  lets not go to conclusion yet.
-	-	People, including myself, found it believable that DSK was a possible rapist when he was initially accused because he is a powerful figure with a history of abusing his considerable power for sexual indiscretions, and he has a history of alleged sexual harassment.  Also, the reporting on the maid's character was initially very different.  I agree that the victim's credibility is totally shot and that will probably finish the case, unless the physical evidence is unequivocal.  She wanted to extort DSK?  There's your reasonable doubt right there.
-	-	Ever hear of the boy who called wolf?  
-	-	I don't know whether DSK is guilty or not, and bless his soul of he isn't. But I can imagine perfectly well that it's defenses such as these that have enabled profiteers and tyrants throughout history.
1	4	DSK will never be declared innocent. The charges will likely be dismissed. If they are not after all that we have learned then the prosecutor should be thrown in prison(provided no new evidence that does not depend on her testimony comes up) and DSK will be found not guilty.  However, for the rest of his life (even if she admits to lying about this rape) some people will maintain that he 'got away with it'. His name on google will be attached to rape and his reputation will be forever tarnished. Once a man is accused his name is published and the damage is done. Nothing will ever fix repair it.  He is just lucky that he is rich or his life would have essentially been over.
-	-	&gt;&gt;"It's a fact that the victim here has made some mistakes, but that doesn't mean she's not a rape victim," Mr. Thompson said Friday. &gt; &gt;That is just rich.  That is just _true_.
1	6	She maintains that she was raped in guinea, just not as she described when she applied for asylum. Read the article.  Tbh, people are shocked an immigrant lied to get into the country? What is rich is that there was a lot of tutting and head shaking on this site when DSK's history with women (including previous assault allegations) was brought up to cast him in a bad light, and now the character assassination of the alleged victim begins and reddit throws itself behind the attacks on her whole-heartedly? The hypocrisy is staggering. If we weren't allowed to judge DSK when all the info in the media counted against him, why the hell is judging the victim so flagrantly permissible?
1	4	Her lawyer also [claims that vaginal bruising and a torn ligament](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/iekhf/the_strausskahn_rape_case_probably_isnt_going/) were revealed in a forensic exam (which will come out in court).   There is evidence of DSK's sperm all over the place, leading to a claim of consensual sex on the part of DSK.  It may be difficult to reconcile consensual sex with any injuries.  Plus she is the 2nd person to accuse DSK of attempted rape, and many more have claimed groping.  It is improbable that an non-assaulter would be followed by a *string* of unconnected assault accusations.  One, maybe.   It is much likelier that a serial assaulter would be followed by such a string.
1	4	&gt; Here's the same logic, from the opposite direction  Irrelevant.  The witness is not the one on trial.  The witness is not the one who will be sent to jail.  The witness does not already have a massive prejudice against her due to being the accused.  The witness does not get the protection of the ban on bad character evidence.  Evidence of the bad character of the accused is tightly controlled and permitted in only very restrictive circumstances.  This is to ensure a fair trial of the facts in issue.  &gt; And if X is large enough, they convict.  Psychology of juries does not work this way.  In cases of jury nullification, considerations outside of the actual facts in issue and the evidence of those facts weighs in to convince jurors not to convict.  This is also not how the law works.  Juries are explicitly instructed that "reasonable doubt" makes no reference to statistical probability.  Juries are instructed that if they think the accused is probably guilty, or likely guilty, then they must acquit him.  A criminal conviction based on "probable guilt" is an invalid conviction.  &gt; it will tend to produce a pattern of convictions that more closely matches patterns of guilt.  And you miss the point of the entire concept of a fair trial and justice.  The object of the justice system is not to produce patterns of conviction that line up with statistics within a margin of error.  The object is to punish the guilty and to let the innocent go free.  The object is that it's better to let 100 guilty people go free than to convict a single innocent person.  A miscarriage of justice is not a statistical outlier, it is a fundamental failure of the entire system and calls its legitimacy into question.  Grandma is really unlikely to be even charged of car theft because the people laying the charge possess the bias you've just expressed, regardless of her actual guilt.  The greasy punk will always be accused because he's a greasy punk.  It is easier to convict a greasy punk because, while he may not be guilty of this specific thing, he's probably guilty of something and who cares, right?  This isn't the development of systems and rules that feel good, this is a recognition based on centuries of experience handed down through case law and history of how people think and the psychology of criminality on all sides - the psychology of the criminal, of the judge, lawyers, cops - and especially of juries and the public at large.  The justice system does not exist in a controlled environment.  It cannot, due to fundamental principles of democracy that demand openness and abhor secret trials.  The starting point from which you view perceived flaws in the truth seeking purpose of trials is wrong.
-	-	[deleted]
-	-	Assange was accused of rape between two people who know each other intimately. DSK is accused of raping a stranger. The maid had DSK's semen on her and physical signs of rape (or DSK's bad penetrative technique).  One thing this article doesn't claim: her testimony about the rape hasn't changed slightly. She has trouble dealing with her past that's for sure, but she's being very clear about what she says happened the day DSK engaged in a sexual activity with her (his semen is undeniable evidence that such thing occurred). To what extent do his actions constitute rape is a question independent of her personal conflicts with talking about her past. The question relates only to which extent her testimony of the rape can be asserted. Her testimony has been clear and consistent.
1	6	Dude, you're clearly just a troll.   I read your comments in the last thread and in this one from your history, and it's just clear.  You skip the meat of everyone's post and respond to technicalities that you can swing to reinforce your point.  Anonymous Coward?  What an apt name...
-	-	I can remenber when shit was resolved in courts and not the press.
0	1	First of all, I love that they get an incredibly accurate translation of this unique dialect complete with American phrases ("he's got money"). Oh I forgot, we all have spent lots of time in Guinea studying the languages.  Also, I get that her credibility is shot because her "story has changed" and she lied about getting into the country--but they're leaving out the circumstances. She's not seeking asylum from a relaxed, well established country, she's seeking asylum from fucking Guinea, one of the poorest countries in the world. And as far as her story changing--how are they treating this woman? Do you think she gets to go home at night and relax? She's probably being badgered day and night and knows her citizenship is hanging in the balance.   People need to watch more SVU. Mariska Hargitay would never let this shit happen.
-	-	I say, "Bitch slap her."
-	-	Yeah, I'm posting on the net when I could be getting into all kinds of mischief.  *eyeroll*
1	4	&gt;&gt; Nothing proves it.  &gt; Ummm? How about physical evidence from the scene and the testimony of the parties alleged to be involved?  HA!  That's my entire point!  [Eyewitness testimony is hideously unreliable](http://agora.stanford.edu/sjls/Issue%20One/fisher&amp;tversky.htm), but the defense may not provide scientific evidence of this unreliability to the jury.  As for physical evidence, this too can be faked - do you note how the defenders of DSK claim that the maid stole his sperm, and caused her own injuries?  The judicial system of standards evidence came into play before the advent of modern statistics, and before our knowledge of the frailty of human memory.  *Everything* in the court system is already a probabilistic argument - is this witness's memory valid?   Is the DNA test probative?  Was this DNA planted?    The fact that the accused has had previous accusations conveys more statistical knowledge.    I understand that this will never be used, but from the perspective of obtaining a best estimate of the truth, it is valuable information.  &gt; Ben Stein's defence of DSK exhibits a most egregious form: ...  Ben Stein is correct in principle, but wrong in application.  A former car thief is more likely to steal a car than a grandmother in a nursing home.    But DSK was already notorious for groping, assault, and harassment.  And there is nothing to suggest that powerful men are inherently ethical, as Stein suggests.      
1	4	&gt; Hum, such an excercise of statistics has no meaning without understanding of the system and its degrees of freedom.  Here's a simple form that can be plugged into a straighforward Bayesian reasoning chain:  1. what fraction of men are rapists?  2. what fraction repeat their rapes, and how often? ie, what is the typical rape-rate?  3. what  is the probability that an innocent person is accused of rape, the innocent-accusation rate?  4. given two unrelated rape accusations what are the probabilities that 1) person belongs to the rapist class 2) person committed *this* rape, given his probabilistic membership in rapist class?  Taking into account all cross terms, of course, like "rapist but not this rape" or "not previous rapist but this rape".  This is a solvable math problem.  If you don't know the inputs, use ranges or distributions for them.  Your point about the system not being characterized fully is valid, but this is a problem that the courts deal with every day.  They evade it by avoiding placing numerical bounds on their likelihoods, and producing yes/no answers instead of more honest maybes.   The answer of "We think that there is a 95% chance that suspect X is guilty, so we will lock him away for 20 years" is socially unacceptable.  So we embrace a myth of 'beyond reasonable doubt' after objectively [sic] weighing the evidence, instead.  I agree that this sort of reasoning will never be used in court, because the court system is not interested in being fully honest, because this would bring painful truths to the surface. It is interested in creating a socially comfortable illusion of objectivity and infallibility. 
-	-	Without further explanation on your part, I believe you understand the meaning of neither of these words. 
1	4	&gt; Can we use her proven history of lying to say she was much more likely to be lying about being raped?   That is what is happening, with the prosecution being pulled back and DSK being released from bail. It's a reasonable question to ask.  A witness with a history of lying is less credible than one without such a history.  Thank you for demonstrating the validity of this type of inference.   For her credibility, the issue is *What is the likelihood that a person who has lied about immigration matters and did not give a full and honest accounting of her actions after a purported rape would lie about the rape itself?*     For his credibility, the issue is *What is the likelihood that an man without a propensity to rape would be plagued with an succession of independent rape and assault allegations?*  &gt; So quit making the same argument about him, thanks.  I just said "YES" to your question.  You did not perchance make make a sarcastic remark after incorrectly presupposing my answer to your rhetorical question, did you?  That would make you look very, very silly.   You should wait for my answer before criticizing me for it!
-	-	Wait, are you kidding me? Because a person is more than their labor, or their services. Because a person is not an object to be sold, even if they are selling their labor. It is their labor being sold, not the individual, and people have the right to consent upon how their bodies are treated by others. 
-	-	Never hear the harassment of other women at the IMF part, or the widespread stories of groping.  Do you have a link to a source?
-	-	"'baseless'? We have a woman testifying to it."  Who ? In what court ? There is one in NY. Who is the other ?  "'total fabrication'? You mean the sperm, and the claimed forensic evidence of injury?  Certainly, there are disturbing inconsistencies."  You didn't read the latest news, did you ? Sperm does not equal rape. (especially if she was a prostitute, which she may very well have been) As for the forensic evidence of injury,  1) please provide a source that is NOT coming from her attorney 2) there is no evidence whatsoever that they were caused by the alleged rape. In fact, for a torn ligament, she didn't even report it before several days.
-	-	He admitted have had "consensual" sexual behaviours with her. If she is a prostitute, that's quite expected, I guess.
1	4	&gt; Physical signs of rough sex.   Fixed that for you. It's not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that it was, as a matter of fact, a rape. That's what the courts are for, and the courts (in this case the prosecutors) have decided that her initial story isn't what it seems.   The court of public opinion may have convicted him as a rapist, but reality and what a bunch of people who'd like nothing more than to see a powerful man go down believe to be true don't always agree. 
1	4	&gt; It's unfortunate that she felt she needed to embellish the rape  Did you read the whole [letter](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/07/01/nyregion/20110701-Strauss-Kahn-letter.html?hp)? Please do, it is very illuminating.  If a rape had really happened, there was no need to 'embellish' anything, so why lying in the first place?   What if she had 'embellished' also the DSK rape story?  She has proven to be a liar, and the conversation with her buddy in jail proves she was fully determined to get maximum profit from her current situation.  I do not like DSK as a person, or for his role in the IMF; but throwing him in jail for a rape he did not commit is not my idea of fairness.  On a separate note, I was travelling abroad some weeks ago, and declined to stay in the Sofitel (do not trust maids there).   True story.          
1	4	DSK had a dinner this evening and was drinking Brunello di Montalcino wine [(source)](http://www.intravino.com/primo-piano/strauss-kahn-cameriere-brunello/).  You know who else liked Brunello di Montalcino?  **BENITO MUSSOLINI**
-	-	Yeah, he deserved to get eaten. I'm fairly certain that was the lesson Aesop intended. 
-	-	&gt; the attacks on her whole-heartedly  nothing has been proved, that's why DSK " allegedly" made untoward sexual advances. they haven't even specified what the these advances were. how about you wait for a verdict.  
1	6	"She maintains that she was raped in guinea, just not as she described when she applied for asylum."  She has a record of changing her stories along the events. Why exactly should one believe her about that one ? "Highly unreliable".
1	6	Don't be fooled by the attorney. What attorneys claim outside the court is pretty worthless as their claims haven't been examined nor debated. M. Thompson knows his case is toast, all he does is damage control. Remember that it's the same guy who presented his client as a perfect employee and hard working citizen beyond any reproach. Now we know for sure this presentation is pretty far from the reality, and it would even seem that she actually sometimes works as a hooker in the Sofitel hotel besides being a maid.  Nothing proves that these alleged bruises happened during the alleged assault. In fact, she talked about the torn ligament only days after the events.  As for the accusations of Mrs Banon in France, they relate an assault attempt that supposedly happened 10 years ago. They have never been examined in court, and of course there is absolutely no proof whatsoever. So of course it can't be ruled out, but that is to take with a pinch of salt. And BTW she works for a website that leans heavily to the right wing, and therefore would see DSK as the biggest threat to Sarkozy for presidential elections.  Coming back to what happened in that suite, if we consider that she in fact was a hooker, this changes a lot our perspective. M. Strauss-Kahn was not a first timer in this hotel. He probably knew that several maids could offer some special services that go well beyond the basics of cleaning the room. It could very well be that she offered her special services to M. Strauss-Kahn, hence a lot of male DNA spread everywhere, and decided to take advantage of him.  OTOH, even if he knew she was not a mere maid, he may have tried to abuse her and rape her, but then since nobody knows what really happened, it's word against word. And at this game, the liar loses.
-	-	Which is exactly why this sort of "propensity evidence" is excluded from trials.  Because a history of assault allegations is taken to be proof of the current allegations, while it is no such thing.  That he groped women does not prove he raped *this* woman at *this* time and place.  Now, the vaginal bruising and torn ligament and sperm "all over the place" - that's evidence.  That's proof.
-	-	Yes it's true. But there's no way a jury will trust her testimony, especially since she admitted lying about a rape in the past. 
-	-	It does not mean she's not a rape victim, but it does mean she sometime lies, which does mean her account of the even is less trustful, which is what matters here. 
-	-	wholeheartedly?? i don't think you understand how reddit works.
1	4	&gt;If we weren't allowed to judge DSK when all the info in the media counted against him, why the hell is judging the victim so flagrantly permissible?  For the same reason that  people judged him. People like to judge other people and will jump on any past mistakes as absolute proof of wrong doing. Far too many people believe that 'where there is smoke, there is fire'.  This is why the names of both the accuser and the accused must be protected from the press until after the trial concludes with a guilty verdict. 
1	4	Nagy is not hearsay.  Christophe Deloire and Christophe Dubois are journalists and authors, relying on interviews.   Aurelie Filipetti is a first person account.  &gt; Sounds like the typical hearsay you get whenever anyone gets accused of a crime.  I am familiar with no such 'typical hearsay'.     And these are all from *before* the accusation, not afterwards as you suggest.  
1	6	What? From the NYT article linked to in this post...   "The housekeeper also told investigators that she had been gang raped in Guinea. She cried and became "markedly distraught when recounting the incident," according to a letter to the defense from prosecutors released Friday. But she later admitted that that, too, was a lie, once again one she had told to help her application for asylum. She said she was indeed raped in Guinea, but not in the way she had described."  It's unfortunate that she felt she needed to embellish the rape - as if that's even possible - in order to gain asylum, but she was desperate, and that was the story she told. That doesn't make it a lie, nor does it not make her a victim.  
-	-	She maintains she was raped in Guinea. She only admitted that it did not happen the way she told it in the immigration application.   The 'she admitted she lied about being raped' being repeated is one hell of a disingenuous assertion. 
-	-	Which appears to be proven false by the key card records.
-	-	He's not accused of raping two women.  The episode you refer to is a French journalist that recently came forward accusing him of groping her during an interview 10 years ago.  She has not pressed charge.  The other story is that he had an affair with a subordinate at the IMF.
-	-	&gt;physical signs of rape  The fact that you overlooked the above-quoted cluster of words leads me to believe you might have tunnel vision.
-	-	There isn't even evidence of sex. There is evidence of semen but it is pretty easy to find semen in a man's hotel room if you are a maid cleaning up a room. Find a tissue and smear it on your dress and bam forensic evidence.
-	-	[MY MOM!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuO_ylFYsQU&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=13s)
-	-	Or she could have scrapped it off the carpet...or the wall...where the maid claimed she had spit it out and where she led police to it.  Even Strauss Kahn's defense team isn't trying to pretend that they didn't have sex.  It's obvious they weren't included in the three people who upvoted you.
-	-	Yeah, totally.  Like 20-odd upvotes for a comment he/she disagrees with is enough to make a blanket statement vilifying tens of thousands of people.
0	2	The torn ligament is something new that the complainant brought up to the prosecution only this past week.  It's most likely bullshit, and another example of discrediting her character and with it, the entire case. 
-	-	Here is my Godwin point: Hitler was probably very faithful!     
-	-	The jury should never "trust" anyone's testimony, but to go with the physical evidence she can give a picture of what happened.
-	-	This is one hell of a double-standard. Her history is fair game to discredit her, but his history is out of bounds? If his string of sexual assault and harrassment allegations aren't evidence, then her lying on her immigration application sure as hell isn't evidence either.  Let's keep this fair, reddit. 
-	-	Bruising plus semen is physical evidence of rape.
-	-	You don't know how much "bruising" was involved in this "vaginal bruising"  It's probably just a normal thing caused by the physics involved in sex.
1	4	&gt; Because a history of assault allegations is taken to be proof of the current allegations, while it is no such thing.   This is a problem with using the legal rather than scientific-statistical evidence of 'proof'.  The legal system gives the defendant the benefit of the doubt in certain ways (excluding a criminal history that *statistically* makes him more likely to be the sort who commits crimes), but also subjects the defendant to evidence that does not pass scientific muster (bite mark evidence, eyewitness testimony).   Then a jury of mediocrities (or sub-mediocrities, after the selection process) is given the task of analyzing this evidence, without being allowed even to take notes.  &gt; That he groped women does not prove he raped this woman at this time and place.  It does not *prove* it.  Nothing *proves* it.   But it establishes a probability that this is a person who does this sort of thing.      That's genuine information.   By using quantitative knowledge of how rapists repeat their crimes, you can plug this into a rigorous Bayesian formula (as good but not better than its inputs), along with other knowledge, to figure out that there is a (for example) 85% chance he's guilty.  Then you decide if the remaining 15% constitutes 'reasonable doubt'.   This is how a scientific paper on DSK would work.  But this kind of logic is anathema to the courts, which substitute a different set of logic that they pretend is somehow better, because it feels more emotionally satisfying. 
-	-	The press does not serve justice. 
-	-	That DA has some double agenda!
-	-	&gt;  The episode you refer to is a French journalist that recently came forward accusing him of groping her during an interview 10 years ago.  She came forward to her mother and lawyer immediately after the alleged assault, then on French TV in 2007 (*before* the maid affair).  She definitely is accusing him of attempted rape - that's what she claims to have shouted during the assault.    &gt; The other story is that he had an affair with a subordinate at the IMF.  That's part of it.  He took an untoward interest in her.  She says she was intimidated into the affair. She also claims harassment of other women.     There are also widespread stories of groping, and of journalists and underlings refusing to be alone with him in the same room. Groping is assault.
-	-	&gt; One accusation is baseless  'baseless'?   We have a woman testifying to it.  &gt;  the other is being shown as total fabrication.  'total fabrication'?  You mean the sperm, and the claimed forensic evidence of injury?  Certainly, there are disturbing inconsistencies.
-	-	Hum, such an excercise of statistics has no meaning without understanding of the system and its degrees of freedom. I guess it would require a whole psychological profile, including classification of recent events in DSK's life that could have a positive or negative effect on his behaviour, demeanor towards others and propensity to commit such acts.  I don't know why your logic is not allowed in courts, but I would not allow it due to oversimplification, and the lack of means to properly characterise the system under consideration and verify such a statistical approach at this point in time.
-	-	You're conflating statistical with circumstantial.
0	2	That may absolutely be true, but it's still evidence that can be put to the test.  This stuff about propensity and "he did it before" and statistics and so on - that's a load of bullshit and is *not* evidence of the crime alleged.
1	4	&gt; But it establishes a probability that this is a person who does this sort of thing.  This is explicitly forbidden evidence in a courtroom, especially before a jury.  The danger of the misuse of this evidence is incredibly high.  There must be substantial probative value before this evidence is admitted.  You assail the standard of proof used in a court room and hold up a scientific-statistical model of evidence as being superior.  You deride the judicial model as being "pretend" and trivialize the mountains of experience behind its development as merely "emotionally satisfying".  You really don't understand politics and psychology, do you?  &gt; Nothing *proves* it.  Ummm?  How about physical evidence from the scene and the testimony of the parties alleged to be involved?  You do see the danger of this statistical evidence, right?  You exhibit one of its primary dangers: that it comes cloaked in the veil of Authority of *SCIENCE*.  Oh snap, *SCIENCE* says he's probably guilty.  There is, of course, perversions of your statistical analysis: [Ben Stein's defence of DSK](http://spectator.org/archives/2011/05/17/presumed-innocent-anyone#) exhibits a most egregious form:  &gt; In life, events tend to follow patterns. People who commit crimes tend to be criminals, for example. Can anyone tell me any economists who have been convicted of violent sex crimes? Can anyone tell me of any heads of nonprofit international economic entities who have ever been charged and convicted of violent sexual crimes? Is it likely that just by chance this hotel maid found the only one in this category? Maybe Mr. Strauss-Kahn is guilty but if so, he is one of a kind, and criminals are not usually one of a kind.  The issue is not what statistical models say about DSK, the issue is whether there was non-consensual sex between him and this maid on the date and in the place alleged.  No one was there except DSK and the maid.  Physical evidence has been left behind.  There are also the stories of two humans, the maid and DSK.  Both have motivations.  Both have imperfect perception.  Both have defective memories.  The maid has complained to the authorities that DSK has committed a crime against her.  If this is true, then DSK must be punished in accordance with the law.  Our society prizes individual liberty and abhors limiting that freedom without a good reason.  Or so our social theory about ourselves goes.  So someone has to make a decision about this allegation.  The decision maker has to sit down and be shown the evidence.  They have to hear what people have to say for themselves.  And then they have to make a decision about the Truth of an event that none of them were present for and inflict punishment on a man based on their decision about what happened.  And you deride this system as mere pretend and trivialize its justifications as emotionally satisfying?  Go back to the lab, poindexter.
1	6	Why is that rape and not theft?
1	6	What about giving clues about the actual case ?
1	4	Can we use her proven history of lying to state she was lying about being raped?  No, we can't.  So quit making the same argument about him, thanks. edit: cleaned up my first sentence to keep it from being misread
-	-	I agree completely, but now his version of consensual (i.e paid) sex as opposed to rape is much more credible. That's why I conclude "it's her word against his word." And at this game, the credibility of the two protagonists is paramount. And so far she proved to be a consistent liar.
-	-	&gt; It doesn't mean her story shouldn't be fully investigated, it just means she deserves fair treatment.  Indeed she does. But she lied (convincingly) about a rape that did not happen, so I find it hard to believe her now.   Also DSK deserves a fair treatment - he did not get it, not even here on Reddit.
-	-	"It doesn't mean her story shouldn't be fully investigated, it just means she deserves fair treatment."  She did.  He didn't.
1	4	The French upper classes had institutionalised extra-marital lovers as far back as 17th century, maybe even farther back. Voltaire lived as a live-in lover of a married woman for many years. Her husband was on good terms with him.

-	-	I agree that there could be a language barrier, but this is also a person who is gaming the system by hiding her income to preserve public benefits and lying about having another child to get further benefits, she seems savvy enough to be able to communicate her story, despite the obvious terrible, horrible stress of reporting a rape.
-	-	So does he, the media has already decided he is guilty before trial. TBH even without her lying he should not be convicted, locking someone away for 25 years on the basis of "He said She said" is crazy and dangerous.

0	3	actual rapes happen far more often than false rape accusations.  the majority of rapes are committed by either family relatives or close friends of the victim.  even more, rapes can occur against men too, whether that be by women or other men.  i can't help but think your passion towards this issue is caused by some misplaced fear that you'll somehow be falsely accused of rape.  sure false accusations do happen, but you should try finding some support groups of people who were actually raped and hear not only the twisted, gruesome shit that has happened to these people, but how more often than not the scales of justice are tilted against the victims.  situations like this and the duke lacrosse team are exceptional circumstances and not the norm of reality.
-	-	It's about as clear and consistent as London on a foggy night. 
-	-	She hasn't been clear about what happened the day DSK engaged in a sexual activity with her.  Her story of what happened immediately after the event is now that she cleaned another room, returned to DSKs room to clean it and then reported the attack.
-	-	Know how easy it is to find a man's semen in a hotel room if you are a maid? **You just freaking grab a tissue from the waste basket and rub it on your dress.**   Then poke yourself in the eye once or twice and bam "forensic evidence".
-	-	&gt; DSK is accused of raping a stranger.   DSK is accused of raping *two* women who do not know each other, plus a habit of groping women.   This is the clincher for me. You might get falsely accused of rape *once*.  Not *twice* in different cities.
-	-	&gt;The maid had DSK's semen on her and physical signs of rape  This physical evidence should trump any conclusions that judgmental pricks might jump to based on this woman's behavior. 
-	-	You seeing these down-votes?  Strauss-Kahn's tentacles are far reaching.  Good thing everybody always reads the down-voted comments anyway because they are the juiciest.

-	-	&gt; It reeks of the olden times when, if you were a women of ill repute, nobody would buy your rape claims.   This is what I take issue with.  There have been several stories in the recent past that have been made up in order to seek money and/or attention.  [This](http://www.wtae.com/news/17789356/detail.html) case for example.  I'm not saying that this is what's occuring here, but I don't think you can completely throw out her past.    To be skeptical of her is fair game, but you're asserting that when those here are skeptical of her, then they're announcing his innocence.   Again, this is just how I'm perceiving what you're writing.  I cannot decipher tone from written text. As far as I'm concerned, it's innocent until proven guilty for both parties involved.
0	2	"There are lots of other ways to explain the $100K. The evidence so far is that it is drug money laundered by others into her account. She seems to be uneducated and naive and, to put it succinctly, an amoral bottom-dwelling survivor. It does't make much sense for a maid to continue working as a maid if she had actual access to the money, rather than simply had an account opened in her name."  It does make a lot of sense when she lies about her condition for taxes, and if even more if she is a hotel hooker (okay, still hypothetical, but the NY Post seems to have several converging sources).  "Doesn't sound that vague:"  When I say vague, I mean nothing that permits to verify the truth of her allegations. She could perfectly make up all this. Whatever she says the fact is she didn't file anything, and 5 days after talking about filing, she said she isn't going to. OTOH, I expect him to file a case for defamation as soon as he comes back to France. BTW, she works for Atlantico, which is a right wing information web site.  "Why shouldn't we talk about it? We can mention the source, and the fact that it isn't confirmed by the prosecution (who have some obligations to stay out of the media to avoid tainting the trial)."  Whatever the attorneys say outside the court is geared towards the media, i.e mostly baloney. Her attorney painted her as a simple working woman without any problem, remember ? Well, hardly the case.
-	-	The statement is not from Nagy.  All statements (except the 2006 book, which is not quoted) were made after the accusation.
0	1	you literally think prostitutes cannot be raped you fucking slimeball piece of shit  also grats [u made my blog](http://redditisterrible.tumblr.com/)
-	-	&gt; Dude, you're clearly just a troll.   This is your response to my proof that you edited your post, and pretended to have said something other that what you actually said?  Catching you in a deception is 'trolling'?  Oh my!
1	6	&gt; Irrelevant. The witness is not the one on trial.   You still don't see my point.  I'm not speaking of trials conducted by USA legal rules.  I'm speaking of probabilities and logical inference.  The logical *method* remains valid (or invalid) in both instances.  Whether the method is admissible in court in a particular instance is another matter.      &gt;  This is to ensure a fair trial of the facts in issue.  Ah!  But my point is that 'fair trial' is not the same as 'accurate statistical inference of guilt and innocence'.  The legal system is very imprecise, and hobbled by rules of procedure and evidence. Sometimes this hurts the defendant, and sometimes it helps him.     &gt; Juries are explicitly instructed that "reasonable doubt" makes no reference to statistical probability.  Ha!  This is an evasion of the issue by math-phobes.   "Reasonable doubt" must include some notion of probability.  Otherwise, the instructions would demand certainty.   For instance, it is *always* possible that a quantum fluctuation created a precise clone of DSK, who then proceeded to rape the maid while the real DSK was reading the Financial Times in the next room.     This is *proof* that there is a finite though small probability that DSK is innocent, no matter what the evidence.  Therefore no criminal can ever be found guilty of anything if mere 'probability' of guilt is insufficient to convict.  QED.  &gt; The object of the justice system is not to produce patterns of conviction that line up with statistics within a margin of error. The object is to punish the guilty and to let the innocent go free.  Ha!  That's the myth, to avoid the complicated truth: Juries engage in implicit statistical analysis, and when they become sufficiently convinced of guilt (beyond some internally defined reasonable doubt), they convict.   This is not a comfortable thing to contemplate because if innocence is possible with probability 'p', then fraction 'p' of prisoners in jail are *by construction* innocent.  So we pretend that 'reasonable doubt' does not leave behind a certain 'probability of innocence'.    Such reasoning would never be allowed in a scientific paper, because it is simply wrong.  &gt; The object is that it's better to let 100 guilty people go free than to convict a single innocent person. A miscarriage of justice is not a statistical outlier, it is a fundamental failure of the entire system and calls its legitimacy into question.  Of course!  That's what we pretend.  The truth is too hard to bear.  What is the 'reasonable' in 'reasonable doubt'?  Is it that we never convict when we admit the possibility of innocence?  By this argument, any juror should 1) realize that juries have convicted the innocent. 2) realize he is on a jury, no better or worse than past juries  3) realize that if he convicts, then he may be one of those jurors who convicts an innocent person 4) therefore refuse to convict, ever.  I think that most people are  incapable of thinking along such honest statistical lines, so they embrace the myth that 'merely probably guilty' people are not convicted.          
-	-	&gt; "It's a fact that the victim here has made some mistakes, but that doesn't mean she's not a rape victim," Mr. Thompson said Friday.   That is just rich.   She lied about a previous rape (which never happened) and established herself to be pathologically inconsistent and downright perfidious about even the most basic facts—such as the part where she said the prosecutors were haranguing her when no such thing had happened. She clearly exhibits histrionic behavior when she dives to the floor and cries while recalling—which she later admits—events in her life that never happened.  We're supposed to take her word for it to put a man in prison for something he may, or may not have committed. It's pathetic how some are so quick to label Dominique Strauss-Kahn a rapist because he's guilty of being a powerful white man. The same things were said of Julian Assange, and look at where that case is going. 
-	-	&gt;Are you going to contrive some explanation about the maid not being into S&amp;M, or are you that familiar with her sex life?  You mean, attempt to prove a negative ([burden of proof, blah blah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance)).  &gt;you're unflinching support of her story adn questioning his is a little pot-kettle  Where have I expressed unflinching support for her side of the story? (do not confuse unflinching support of her with unflinching suspicion of him)  I am suspicious of both, my gripe is with people who sweep aside physical evidence in favor of an evaluation of how the woman acts or behaves.  It reeks of the olden times when, if you were a women of ill repute, nobody would buy your rape claims.
-	-	Honest nontroll question -- but with Maria Shriver leaving Arnold in the news today and the whole Anthony Weiner fresh in our memory. I heard on NPR one of the first things he did when he was released on bail was have lunch with his wife. Yet he admits to having a consensual sexual encounter. Is it just me thinking that is just odd?
-	-	Like most rape cases there is no physical evidence of rape.  There is physical evidence of sex, and we just have to trust her when she says it was non-consensual.  The fact that she is so hard to trust is a problem.
-	-	At some point, you realize that adults have to lead their own life as they see fit.  So Dad is a womanizer. Mom does not care (by the way, Anne Sinclair is not her mother). Dad also has wonderful qualities that maybe your faithful Dad does not have.  You are making life limited to who sleeps with whom.
-	-	&gt;Where was there ever signs of sex?  I believe the Strauss-Kahn's defense team has already conceded this point.  
1	4	&gt; This is also not how the law works. Juries are explicitly instructed that "reasonable doubt" makes no reference to statistical probability. Juries are instructed that if they think the accused is probably guilty, or likely guilty, then they must acquit him. A criminal conviction based on "probable guilt" is an invalid conviction.  Isn't the determination of whether "the accused is probably guilty, or likely guilty" fundamentally a question of information certainty and reliability?  Surely any attempt to formalize such concepts involves some measure of probability.  While I might say that I believe some event E occurred at some time T, internally I perceive this statement to be one of probabilty; your statement on the legal interpretation of probability is equivalent to suggesting I could not enter any post priori statements or decisions while on a jury because, to me, all post priori statements are fundamentally probabilistic.    &gt; And you miss the point of the entire concept of a fair trial and justice. The object of the justice system is not to produce patterns of conviction that line up with statistics within a margin of error. The object is to punish the guilty and to let the innocent go free. The object is that it's better to let 100 guilty people go free than to convict a single innocent person. A miscarriage of justice is not a statistical outlier, it is a fundamental failure of the entire system and calls its legitimacy into question.  Once again, I think you are making statements that do not conform to any rigorous, mathematical worldview.  Anonymous-coward's statement did exclude the necessity for judicial systems to strongly favor false negatives (letting the guilty go) over false positives (jailing the innocent).  Taking this into account, it would be simple to create a appropriate weighing function to compare the 'correctness' of various judicial implementations.  And while there do exist circumstances where the ideal weighted solution is not the most accurate, I find it dangerous to embark on ANY real world fact finding without accuracy as a necessary virtue.  Ideally, given enough accuracy (whether this is judicially possible is another issue altogether) the need for false positives to be stringently controlled does vanish, although such accuracy very rarely occurs in real life.  &gt; A miscarriage of justice is not a statistical outlier  But from a mathematical or statistical perspective it is certainly an outlier, at least for a reliable, accurate process.  Why is your perspective more correct that the mathematical one?
1	8	The only evidence is that he had sex with her. He has never denied that, because why would he?   Evidence of sex is not evidence of rape.   I'm sorry that reality does not coincide with your Evil White Man Rapes Poor Black Woman narrative.

-	-	[She admitted it herself](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/07/01/nyregion/20110701-Strauss-Kahn-letter.html?hp).  In two separate interviews she described (crying and showing great emotional distress) how she was gang-raped and tortured back in Ghana.  She later admitted it was all a lie, a story memorized by repeatedly listening to a tape recording prepared by a 'third party' to facilitate her asylum application.   If anything, this shows she could (convincingly) lie about being raped.  
-	-	She admitted it.
1	6	Why would I?  It's 2011.  Jesus, get out of the bronze age.

-	-	It is great indeed. However there are some dots that still leave suspicion: for example, the fact that part of the Accor top management seems to belong to UMP, the party of Sarkozy, and directly announced to him the news. Or that a guy affiliated to the youths of UMP, Jonathan Pinet, who said having some friend who had a friend in the hotel, was the first to twitt DSK's arrest, 14 minutes only after it happened. Arnaud Dassier, the guy who started a media smear campaign against DSK a few weeks before, and was in charge of the web campaign for Sarkozy in 2007, was also tweeting a few minutes later. He is a founder of the Atlantico web site, a heavily right wing "information" site that also has Mrs Banon as a journalist (the girl who says she was a victim of DSK 10 years ago). And let's not mention that Sarkozy seems to have links with the chief of the NY Police Department.
-	-	No, nearly every business operator can discriminate. You've probably seen the signs. "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone." I think doctors have the only exception, and then only if refusing would cause death.
-	-	you are the worst person in the world
-	-	"Tristane Banon, France, and she is supposedly filing a belated accusation. She had mentioned it on French TV in 2007, but DSK's name was bleeped out, and she discussed it immediately after the alleged rape with others, so it appears she isn't making it up far after the fact."  Supposedly. That's the word. So far nothing about it apart from TV appearances. And as a matter of fact, she isn't filing anything at all for the moment. It happens that I've watched the second interview, where she is the most specific. Well specific isn't the word as during the interview, she is extremely vague about the circumstances of the alleged assault attempt.  "    (especially if she was a prostitute, which she may very well have been)       This is wild speculation with no evidence backing it. You're now saying she's a whore, working as a maid?"  Indeed I admit this is a rumor at the moment. The NY Post is not exactly the best source of information in the US. However it would explain very well part of the 100,000$ found on her account and her telephone bills.  "    1) please give a source that is NOT coming from her attorney       I can't do that, except to say that he claims it is coming from the immediate medical examination by the police. The trial will tell."  Okay, so let's wait for the trial before talking of "evidence", then.
1	4	Thanks, but that's people repeating what someone else has told them that that they heard from someone else...   Sounds like the typical hearsay you get whenever anyone gets accused of a crime.
-	-	That isn't proof of rape. Rape is a very serious crime, if we put everyone who had ever engaged in rough sex behind bars that would just be ridiculous.
-	-	Tristane Banon never accused him of rape.
-	-	Where was there ever signs of sex? Not denying you had sex doesn't mean you admit to having sex. The woman just had semen on her and you can grab semen off any tissue in a wastebasket.
1	4	&gt;That sounds like more than just "rough sex". Are you going to contrive some explanation about the maid being into S&amp;M?  Are you going to contrive some explanation about the maid **not** being into S&amp;M, or are you that familiar with her sex life?  Also, before you jump down my throught claiming I'm just supporting the white guy because that's how I want it to be, I'm not.  I just find it laughable that you're claiming that people are turning a blind eye on him for questioning her, you're unflinching support of her story adn questioning his is a little pot-kettle. 
-	-	The feeling is mutual.
-	-	&gt; She was given an audio tape of facts to memorise by a 'male'   I fail to see why the sex of her accomplice should bear any relevance to this, or why you should put it between quotes.  She did not 'embellish' (in quotes) anything, she lied about a rape which was not there; then, when caught, she produced another, different rape story - not credible, to the point that even the prosecutor refused to accept it.  She also lied about a number of other facts, times, and situations related to her alleged abuse by DSK.  I think you should leave your presupposition aside, and start to consider that an innocent may have been thrown in jail just because he is white, rich, powerful and 'male'.
-	-	I think his daughter feels her father's private life should stay private. And she's not a religious nut, she probably doesn't care that her father dares to have sex.
1	4	I don't think personal quarrels and affairs should be publicized, that is all. Of course no one will agree that affairs, rape, etc. aren't serious matters. It's just as terrible, however, how the media launches such sweeping attacks even without a formal verdict.   I'm simply sick of how often the media 'jumps the gun'. If DSK did in fact force the hotel maid to perform sexual acts then obviously he should be reprimanded. Far too often, however, have decent politicians been ousted for entirely irrelevant issues. I'm openly using hyperbole when I say this, but who cares if a pervert is in office if he's doing a damn good job? I guess that is politics though. Top Wall Street officials can dance around with their prostitutes all they want and no one bothers. As soon as a politician lays even a hand on a woman other than his wife he's dubbed as an evil doer. 
-	-	You don't know wtf you're talking about. Watch inside job, he's in the movie.
-	-	I know that you're not saying this exactly, but I do want to make the point that even if someone is a sex worker, that doesn't mean they can't be raped. I don't think that it changes our perspective if someone is a sex worker, or at least it shouldn't. There's a huge difference between consensual sex and rape: consent or lack thereof, and often violence.   
-	-	I doubt he has anything to do with socialism considering he was the managing director of IMF.
-	-	You have no clue. DSK is a leftist, and in fact tried to spread leftist views throughout the IMF. He publicly held views that are opposed to neoliberalism.  OTOH, the new IMF leader, Christine Lagarde, is totally committed to neoliberalism and banks.
-	-	No.  Ben Stein's still a dick.
-	-	I guess we can't trust you, since you're a Muslim.
-	-	NY Gendarmerie?
-	-	&gt; And at this game, the liar loses.  The one with the deepest pocket win?
1	4	It's a somber thought knowing that your position as the head of the IMF and potentially as future president of France (or why not just generalize and say all political life) have been ruined based on meager, unsubstantiated claims. It is pathetic to see how the media immediately jumped to such tremendous claims without waiting for legitimate court rulings and evidence. Need I mention the complete disregard for French law by publishing photos of DSK in handcuffs?   My hat goes off to DSK, given he is declared innocent. I believe he is. I cannot fathom what it must be like to have one's career so seemingly beaten down to a pulp by the repugnant fists of the media seeking after 'a good headline'. 
-	-	While I was reading the report, with each revelation, I kept hearing [this sound](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT-8Dm1VThc) in my head.
-	-	You shouldn't need to have a perfect record to be able to report something to the police.   And the fact that she may have confused her story or misspoke during interviews - well, I think anyone who's suffered such abuse and then has to report the traumatic event, in a language different from her native language, in what was, I'm sure, an intimidating situation, should be shown some understanding. It doesn't mean her story shouldn't be fully investigated, it just means she deserves fair treatment.
-	-	&gt; Yes, this is well known and has been for centuries, not just since someone compiled statistics and drew a graph.  It *hasn't* been known for centuries, at least not to this depth.  The fact that human memory is incredibly malleable and changeable is a recent discovery.  Statistics and graphs are essential, because they tell you just how unreliable it is.  &gt; I'm not saying that it isn't probative evidence, but it derails the object of the trial. The question isn't whether he did it before, but if he did it this time. A serial car thief may not have stolen this particular car.   You're still missing my point.  The end of result of the trial is *really* not guilty or not guilty.  It is "Probability of guilt is X%".    And if X is large enough, they convict.  Past behavior is relevant to *this* car theft as well.     Even implicitly - try to convict a grandma of car theft!  The jury will know that grandmas generally don't steal cars, and this will weigh in on the side of innocence.    Next, try to convict a greasy punk.   The jury will decide that it is *plausible* that a greasy punk will steal cars, and will weigh this factor.   Statistically speaking, the jury is correct.  It is unfair to innocent greasy punks, but it will tend to produce a pattern of convictions that more closely matches patterns of guilt.  Now mentioning previous crimes provides a more objective method of incorporating such prior knowledge.  Here's the same logic, from the opposite direction:  *A woman at the IMF accuses her boss "KSD" of rape.   It is shown that this woman has accused four previous bosses of rape.   Should this weigh for KSD's innocence?   YES! because it is improbable that four bosses in a row would be rapists.*   Would you object and say "It does't matter about the fact that she lied in the past; what matters is whether she is lying *now*".  
1	4	&gt; Sure, this is a valid approach if you have a data set as input to build your chain, and another data set to validate your approach. Where will you get such a (known good) data set?  The academic and police literature, on the subject of rape.  Now I don't see why you need *two* sets, rather than peer reviewed estimates from the body of criminal science.   You would get probability distributions (error bounds) for your inputs, and you'd integrate over them to get your final answer.  &gt; Let me clarify my beliefs here: that there is nothing wrong with Bayesian methods, but there is a problem with implementing it in this case.  I agree with many of your qualms.  For political and psychological reasons, I think we will never let go the myths that underly today's justice system.  This Bayesian argument  should not be the deciding factor, either.  It could be only one additional weight that is given to the jury, to consider along with the evidence for *this* circumstance.     Surely, the opposite is done all the time - *"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, do you think that this upstanding citizen standing before you, a man unsullied by previous accusations, would commit such a crime?"*  The logic is already embraced, but only in one direction.  Do I expect this sort of reasoning to be applied in the courts?  No.  Do I see it as a valid way of thinking about innocence and guilt outside the courts?  Yes.  
-	-	It's also physical evidence of rape.
-	-	&gt;Evidence of rape would have to somehow show that the sex wasn't consensual.  Not sure you understand what "evidence" is...
-	-	There's plenty of reaons to embellish a rape, especially when you're escaping a violent regime where murder and mass rape are a daily occurrance, and your future hangs on passing the US's 'are you in enough danger' checklist to be allowed residence.   She was given an audio tape of facts to memorise by a 'male' for her immigration application. People are overlooking this detail in order to paint her as some master crafter of lies when her own admission indicates she was just reciting what someone else had told her was necessary to get her application accepted.  It's not really fair to freak out and claim she's discredited forever because of this. Context is important. Immigrants can and do lie to get into the US. This shouldn't bear any relevance to what's happening now. 
1	4	In the hypothesis that the UMP would have had something to do with it, the essential point would have been to discredit DSK, not necessarily to have put him behind bars for years.  Of course, the main concern would be that it could not be traced back.  This said, I suppose the NYPD/Cyrus Vance made some phone calls and French government/Embassy said "Do as you please, we won't interfere". The opportunity was too good to be true.
-	-	&gt; Who ? In what court ? There is one in NY. Who is the other ?  [Tristane Banon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristane_Banon#Alleged_sexual_assault_by_Dominique_Strauss-Kahn), France, and she is supposedly filing a belated accusation.      She had mentioned it on French TV in 2007, but DSK's name was bleeped out, and she discussed it immediately after the alleged rape with others, so it appears she isn't making it up far after the fact.       &gt; (especially if she was a prostitute, which she may very well have been)   This is wild speculation with no evidence backing it.  You're now saying she's a whore, working as a maid?  &gt; 1) please give a source that is NOT coming from her attorney   I can't do that, except to say that he claims it is coming from the immediate medical examination by the police.  The trial will tell. 
1	4	You decided to change "physical signs of rape" into "physical signs of rough sex" for no reason other than the fact that you'd prefer this to be the case.  The police found blood at the scene.  That sounds like more than just "rough sex".  Are you going to contrive some explanation about the maid being into S&amp;M?
1	4	&gt; No, my point was that just because she has a history of lying does not mean she was NOT raped.  That's not my point either.  I'm saying that the likelihood that that she is telling the truth is decreased by her past lies.  I noticed you edited your remark from:  &gt; Can we use her proven history of lying to say she was **much more likely** to be lying about being raped?  to   &gt; Can we use her proven history of lying to state she was lying about being raped?  You deliberately modified the bit relevant to my point, and to which I responded, and now you're pretending you said something else!   &gt; Innocent until proven guilty you communist.  Oh my!    
-	-	**It's their bodies**, not an object, not a service. Sex workers provide a service that should involve consent on the part of all parties. Not wanting to be raped is not the same as discriminating against a potential client, it's goddamned *not wanting to be raped*.   You can't walk into a restaurant and just start sexually assaulting people. 
1	4	I see, and in fairy reddit hivemind land, being a leftist means you're good to go.
0	5	Not only he is a socialist, he tried and seemingly succeeded to spread more leftist views in the IMF. And in fact, the IMF seemed to appreciate him very much, given he led the organization back to the forefront.   According to Wikipedia: "Strauss-Kahn made comments that could be perceived as critical of global financial actors, in an interview for a documentary about the Late-2000s financial crisis, Inside Job (2010). He said he had attended a dinner organised by former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in which several CEOs of 'the biggest banks in the U.S' had admitted they (or perhaps bankers in general) were 'too greedy' and bore part of the responsibility for the crisis. They said the government " 'should regulate more, because we are too greedy, we can't avoid it.' " Strauss-Kahn said he warned the officials of a number of departments of the U.S. government of an impending crisis. He also said: "At the end of the day, the poorest – as always – pay the most."  Referring to his diplomatic efforts to secure IMF aid for Europe following the 2010 sovereign debt crisis, economist Simon Johnson described Strauss-Kahn as "Metternich with a blackberry". In May 2011, referring to the IMF's change of heart in favour of progressive rather than neoliberal values, Joseph Stiglitz wrote that Strauss-Kahn had proved himself to be a "sagacious leader" of the institution. Following Strauss-Kahn's arrest for sexual assault in New York, economist Eswar Prasad said that should he be forced to step down, the IMF "will find it hard to find as effective and skilful an advocate for keeping the institution central to the global monetary system".
-	-	Strauss-Kahn was first an activist member of the Union of Communist Students,[15] before joining in the 1970s the Centre d'études, de recherches et d'éducation socialiste (Center on Socialist Education Studies and Research, CERES) led by Jean-Pierre Chevènement, future presidential candidate for the 2002 election.[15] There, he befriended the future Prime Minister of France Lionel Jospin (PS).  After the election of President François Mitterrand (PS) in 1981, he decided to stay out of government. He got involved in the Socialist Party (PS), which was led by Lionel Jospin, and founded Socialisme et judaïsme ("Socialism and Judaism"). The next year, he was appointed to the Commissariat au plan (Planning Commission) as commissaire-adjoint.
-	-	Where did I say I was Muslim.   I am a proud athiest.   Guess you can't trust your blind eyes or your reading skills 
-	-	Upvote for truth.
-	-	On the other hand, the whole setup, unreliable accuser included, would be a great way to disqualify DSK in the presidential race without actually sending him to prison for years. Kind of a shot across the bow, which doesn't leave him with nothing to lose and every reason to retaliate.
-	-	Uh... why are you so sure she lied?
-	-	She lied on her asylum application too. That alone should be enough to get her into alot of trouble. 
-	-	So you wouldn't care if your dad was cheating on your mom?
-	-	I watched it for the first time a week ago - "He doesn't seem so bad!"
-	-	I said it before and I'll repeat it here: not a Sarkozy setup.  It's way too amateurish.   They would have used a better 'professional'; they could afford to pay for it.

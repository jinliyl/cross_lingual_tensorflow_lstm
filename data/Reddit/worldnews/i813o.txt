1	4	I feel like this joke is being totally misapplied.  The joke isn't some tenuous connection with absurdity, it has rules.  For funerals to kill you in Russia, it would have to be assumed that you kill funerals in America.  That doesn't make sense.  A good example of this joke would be "In Soviet Russia, television watches you!"  Seeing as how people watch television quite frequently in America, and Soviet Russia's notorious KGB was apt to spy on their own people, the joke is not only correct in usage, but also in observation.  Try to keep that in mind next time.

-	-	Yes!  This is why I'm so sick and tired of this joke.  It's never applied properly.

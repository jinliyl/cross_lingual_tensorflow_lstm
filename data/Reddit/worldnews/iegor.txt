-	-	Where do I sign up. Wait it's a lottery. I'd need the car in my hands to agree!
-	-	Hmm. I might do it. Thing is about reducing your population through less births in a country where there's so many people is that it ends up where there's a massive aging population and a much smaller younger population, who can't exactly support all these elderly people. China is beginning to experience that now.  My 56 year old father told me that even the population here in New Jersey is huge compared to what it was when he was growing up in the 60's. There was maybe 100 million people in the entire country and there wasn't as many cars or people in his area. Now everyone has a car and New Jersey is by far the most densely populated state in the Union. I just assumed it was always this crowded, even in suburban Central Jersey. Eventually the U.S. will have to take population control measures. The world cannot support 15 billion people.

Yeah, but the alternative is just as scary. We *already* have too much people.

1	4	It's probably not meant to convince anyone, more like an incentive to those who were planning to have it done "sometime" to do it now.
1	4	They probably will keep up the incentives for years.  But that aside, a sterilization today is worth more than a sterilization next year, simply from a demographic standpoint. If you have a net positive growth rate (which India does), then the population is a pyramid with a narrow base that widens the higher you go (as you go forward in time). Removing one reproductive link at the base is worth more than removing one near the top, if population control is your goal.  India is actually doing pretty darn good at population control. The net population growth rate slipped to 1.34% in 2009 according to the World Bank. That's #100 on the list, about the same as the population growth rate in the US, back in the 60's. It also continues to decline steadily.
-	-	But then it's not going to increase the rate of sterilization, it just means they'll probably make their target for this year and then have significantly lower turnouts for the next few years. Maybe if they kept up the incentives indefinitely they might consistently meet their goal, but doing this once will just create an artificial spike and then decline in sterilizations.
-	-	Good for them! Hopefully they'll drop below the replacement rate soon. It's about time humanity as a whole did that; fortunately drops in fertility are strongly correlated with economic development, so as more of the world (however slowly and unevenly) gets wealthier population growth should naturally slow.  Do have to wonder if that'll happen before we have to start turning the elderly into nutritious crackers to feed the young and keep social security costs (where social safety nets for the elderly exist) down.

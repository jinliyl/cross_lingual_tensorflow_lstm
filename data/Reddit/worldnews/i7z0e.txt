-	-	Believe me, nothing will happen in Germany. One national strike in our entire history.  Unless you ban driving or football we won't lift a finger.
-	-	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_the_European_Union#State_by_state_analysis  according to Wikipedia the UK is second after Germany when it comes to net loss. But in money to the EU the UK is 5th place.
-	-	Well even if the UK is only third that still gives the UK a negotiating position, no?  And I'm not sure about France.   They seem to think that in 2009 they were the principal recipient of EU expenditure,  "En termes absolus, la France était en 2009 le principal bénéficiaire des dépenses de l’Union européenne, "  The beginning of paragraph 2 of this,  http://www.touteleurope.eu/fr/organisation/budget/mecanismes-budgetaires/presentation/le-budget-europeen-et-la-france.html  I checked that it translates on babelfish and it does.  
1	4	I was thinking the same thing.  Both Britain *and* the Euro members should be rejoicing that you all never joined.    I was never a euro skeptic but it's clear I should have been.  The skeptics were right from the beginning.

-	-	France only make a small net loss to the EU because they get masses of CAP subsidy.
-	-	Off the top of my head, I would say that:  - France used to be the EU's major beneficiary of agricultural subsidies.  - This may have changed with past-2000 reforms in the EU CAP.   - And in turn be superseded, at least temporarily, by the 2007-2008 food price crisis and 2008 banking crisis.   - The UK is still a special case because of the [UK rebate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uk_rebate) that prime minister Thatcher forced on the EU in 1984 - and which the French have tried to abolish ever since:  &gt;The rebate is calculated as approximately 2/3 of the amount by which UK payments into the EU exceed EU expenditure returning to the UK. Currently the rebate is worth £3bn (GBP) a year   So, even if the UK can claim to be the or third largest net contributor, it still gets special treatment, compared to other net contributors.  I am not saying, btw, that Britain isn't entitled to this rebate - as mentioned, France has rigged the CAP subsidy system very thoroughly and consistently in her favor.     &gt;... without the rebate, the UK would pay much more into the EU than comparably wealthy countries like France, due to structural differences between their economies.  Double standards, rent seeking, protectionism, and selfishness, behind an official facade of multi-lateralism, are unfortunately hallmarks of the EU.
-	-	I think David Mitchel summed up the view of the pro-Euro group very well on Question Time last night, even though his overall input was incredibly shitty and disappointing.
-	-	The biggest change to France is they pay most of the rebate. It swung the EU from a massive net gain for them into a small net loss. While for the UK it went from a huge net loss on what was at that time one of the poorest EU nations to a moderate loss.
1	6	Seems reasonable to this outsider, but please correct me if I'm wrong.  Didn't Britain fight tooth and nail to stay out of the Euro? Why should it suffer along with other countries that weren't as prudent?
1	8	Seems reasonable. We are still a little pissed Ireland is being hung out to dry while everyone runs around to save a country that doesn't want to save itself.  The ECB vetoed us when we asked for Ireland to be allowed to default. I'm not sure we should do them any favours.
-	-	Is it just me or are the PIGS countries being run by white collar criminals that are looting the state treasuries and driving these countries into bankruptcy?
-	-	When the UK left the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992,a precursor to the euro because the pound couldn't stay within it's trading range against the other currencies, no European lifted a finger to help the British.     That was a huge embarrassment to the UK and a source of much snickering if not outright mirth to our European brethren.  The suggestion the Brits should cough up now is a joke and they know it.  But joking aside what counts is the money.  The UK is the second biggest net donor to the EU budget after the Netherlands.  So once all the joking and bitching is over and regardless of the rights and wrongs of it, if the Uk doesn't want to, it don't.   
0	2	When the Euro crashes and the continent slips into recession, its not going to be Spain or Greece rioting in the streets.  It's going to be the Germans who have coddled this supranational disaster from the start.
0	2	We are still a little pissed,you mean you are still drunk?
-	-	Yep, and it was the best decision we ever made. If we were in the Euro we would be like Greece since our economies are near identical(Service Based, Large Public Sector, Little/No Manufacturing Output) Thank you Mr Major, it is probably the only thing you will be remembered for.
0	1	&gt; We are still a little pissed Ireland is being hung out to dry  That's not true! Ireland is part of the EU rescue package and gets money from it.  &gt; The ECB vetoed us when we asked for Ireland to be allowed to default. I'm not sure we should do them any favours.  Of course they don't allow you to default. The whole bail-out rescue package is about not letting the countries default. And believe me: You don't want to default! A default doesn't mean a fresh start! It means that you won't get any money on the open market at all!
-	-	&gt; The UK is the second biggest net donor to the EU budget after the Netherlands.  After Germany and the Netherlands, third actually, and in this position recently rivaled by France.   [Figures here](http://www.eu-oplysningen.dk/euo_en/spsv/all/79/)
-	-	If Greece defaults uncontrollably then the UK will feel the impact whether they are Euro members or not. Greece owes a lot of money to UK banks and investors. The UK's economy is closely connected to the rest of Europe. If there is a big crisis it will affect the UK. So it's really not about having the Euro or not.  Another question of course is whether the EU bail-out for Greece will do any good. A "soft"-default is the best strategy in my opinion: Check who owes whom and drop debt in a way that doesn't endanger the economy.

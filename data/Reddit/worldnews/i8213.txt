-	-	The "graphic photos" aren't graphic at all. Not sure what this article is about. Just a bunch of old war photos with some lurid captions dating from almost 70 years ago. Blah...
1	4	The band Joy Division took their name from these women.  It was not just concentration camp inmates, it was all of the conquered people - Russians, Ukrainians, every race, creed and color.  In Asia, the Japanese Army had "comfort women" that were issued to every platoon. One woman for 14 to 18 men. Koreans, Chinese, Japanese and some round eyes from Indonesia and China.  One of the great shames of the Americans Pacific campaign was what happened to the women.  When the crack Japanese Army that was attacking eastern India surrendered to the British as they were withdrawing into Burma, the British had a problem with what to do with the "comfort women."   Should they be left with their rapists or should they be treated differently?  They were, I believe, segregated in a separate prison camp in Australia.  The "comfort women" that were with the Japanese occupiers in the island chains were murdered by the occupiers.  I don't want to even think of how they died.  The only place that significant numbers of "comfort women" were captured was Rabaul, the huge base that was bypassed on the New Britain Island.  The Japanese women who carried their children off of the cliffs on Guam, to certain death, had a real good idea of what would happen if the Americans captured them.  Armies commit atrocities. The Russians raped their way across eastern Germany. The Allies in the west committed over 30,000 reported rapes in occupied France during the Liberation.   The German army occupying France executed 15 to 20 soldiers for rape.  I have no idea of how the Allies stacked up against that.

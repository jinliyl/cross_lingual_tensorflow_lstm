Then the laborer got another job with an acquaintance, not a friend, and somehow the laborer then borrowed money from the owner who then took the album as collateral. Taking a million dollar archive in Lew of a small debt. It is probably the grandson of Hugo Boss the designer of the famous nazi uniform.

0	1	You're goddam right I am, wonderful people! Tell you what though, I wait ages to meet up with someone from that side of the family, then four or five show up at the same time. 
-	-	Are you related to the Welsh Bus Stops?
-	-	&gt;Like Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg's doctoral thesis, Koch-Mehrin's 2001 thesis, titled 'Historical Currency Unions between Economy and Politics', was analysed using a crowd-source effort, and she was accused of plagiarism. As a consequence of this, on May 11th 2011 she resigned as chairperson of the FDP in the European Parliament and as vice-president of the European Parliament, arguing that she wanted to end the strain the investigation put on her family. She remains a member of the European Parliament, and continued to use the doctor title. On June 15th 2011, the University of Heidelberg officially rescinded her doctorate due to massive plagiarism.

-	-	According to Wikipedia, his full name is—take a deep breath—Karl Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jacob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg, though I guess you have to wonder if his parents just took some of those names from other families and then took the credit for themselves. 
1	8	yeah, ... but guttenberg was actually a good politican... he lied and has to step down and you can obviously see that german citizens took it in their own hands to bring him dont... but he wasnt all that bad.

-	-	He's nobility. Those kinds of names are pretty common for them.
1	4	Actually, fun fact: one time, a prankster added an eleventh name to the list. It was corrected shortly after, but not before the "Spiegel" magazine printed the wrong name as well. It was then reintroduced to Wikipedia, because now there was a proper source for it. 
0	1	Could you elaborate on why he was a good politician? I, for one, think he was a douchebag. The way he handled the Kunduz affair and saying that people who are against internet filters are for childpornography are just two examples.
-	-	i'd rather say he was good at emulating a good politician and a lot of people still fall for this act
1	4	He played a major role in ending Germany's mandatory military service, I don't really care (or know about) his other achievements or shortcomings but I'm very grateful for that alone.
-	-	It's the same in the UK; my full name is Matt Tarquin Fintimlinbinwhinbimlim Bus Stop F'tang F'tang Ole Biscuit-Barrel Fasken.

1	8	One problem for would be adopters is working out what they are signing up to. There was a no bail-out clause. The idea was that the Euro could potentially create a moral hazard. Greece could borrow lots of Euro's secure in the knowledge that Germany would bail it out. But there was a no bail-out clause. If Greece borrowed too much, it would be on its own.  That hasn't worked out. One reason is that Greece not only borrowed too much but  borrowed it from German banks, so the Germans are on the hook for Greek debt anyway.  So what are the rules for the currency union that Latvia is considering joining? If Portugal gets into trouble will Latvia have to contribute to a bail out? "I know the rules say no bail-out, but sometimes you have to do things anyway." If Latvia gets into trouble will Portugal contribute to a bail out? "Sorry, no. Rules are rules, you knew what the rules were when you joined. If you didn't like them you should have stayed out."  Latvia risks joining a club with the rule "Heads I wind, tails you lose."

1	4	&gt;  Because you're essentially saying that if I have a problem with some feature of Islam, I must have a problem with all of it.    NO that's not what i ment, but you fail you to understand that 1 verse =/= 1 subject, nor the subject is limited by that verse. take adultery for example ( reddit's favourite!) , there are limited verses in Quran talking about it , not all Quran talks about adultery. those verses set the definition the meaning the conditions for punishment and the punishment etc, those verses are not in one page or sequential. add to that hadiths that talk about adultery, they  MUST be taken as explaination of Quran.   so if you want to discuss the topic of adultery in islam, you must bring the subject as whole with all the related verses and hadiths. that doesn't mean brining all Quran and Islam's message about monotheism, doing good, after, prophets and angels into the discussion.       .      here is a poor example: when you debate a certain law(X) in the united states, you should bring up the consititutional ammendment above that law (the one that made it possible) , and sub-laws ( or court cases ) that emerged from the law in question (the little x's), bring all those to the discussion to make it revleant. that doesn't mean you bring up all united states laws and consitution ammendments ( all the A to Z's) 
-	-	So?
	I know why you mentioned the previous holy verses; it's to prove that Islam contradicts the new liberal-western view of men and women as being equal.          I'll take it from the end, no Muslim on the face of earth says that the Islamic view of gender is exactly the same as your western-liberal view, and if a Muslim says so (assuming that he thoroughly understands the circumstances of the 2 views),  he automatically becomes non-Muslim.  In Islam, men and women are all equal in the eyes of God, nobody is better because of what he was born with, only with what he does with it.                But in this life, each gender was given different responsibilities, and with each different responsibility comes a law that helps one accomplish his or her responsibility.  Let me give you an example; providing for the family is solely the man's responsibility, the woman is not supposed to work a dime. Even if a poor man marries rich woman, he has no right to take anything from her to spend on the house or food, clothing etc. only if she chose to provide voluntarily then it's fine, but if she refuses and he can't support her, she has the right to divorce.  Another example, If she bears his child and they divorce,  she has the right to ask for a fee for nursing the child ( in addition to alimony)  , or he must find another woman to nurse the child. Of course no mother will refuse to nurse her own child, but the law is there to remind the man that mothering his child is not something to take for granted.  It all revolves around this concept: man must provide, protect, and ( be there ) and do all the manly stuff. And woman must take care of her house ( but not money wise) take care of her husband and her children. This is the Islamic view based on how God created man and woman. Any society that tries to break this view and mix things up, it will suffer.   Now lets look at the holy verse you mentioned in light of this view  ** In first verse ** , I think that your problem is with this part: (and men are a degree above them. Allah is Mighty, Wise )  In the books of tafseer ( explaining Quran) this degree is explained as a conclusion and consequence of the following:   1)	men were created earlier ( Adam before Eve) 2)	husbands must provide for the family 3)	husbands have the right to be acknowledge when the wife is leaving the house, and if the husband refuses ( for logical reason) the wife must obey 4)	husband have the right to know who enters his house. 5)	due to all monetary-material responsibility ( remember that even if the woman is rich, she is not supposed to spend anything on the house), men has twice the portion of inheritance.  6)	 a man's testimony equals double women's testimony  ( and this your problem with second verse, but if you read further in the verse, the reasoning comes right after:  all these laws and facts give men a degree above women, a degree in the matters of this life, ( like saying men have degree above boys size wise ) but if you study it closely you will see that it also means more responsibility.   ** The second verse ** you linked to:  And call to witness, from among your men, two witnesses. And if two men be not (at hand) then a man and two women, of such as ye approve as witnesses, so that if one of the two erreth (through forgetfulness) the one of them will remind.  Meaning: in money issues ( especially loans) women tend to forget the details and numbers, thus if you are giving a loan to someone you must sign witnesses, either 2 men, or a man and 2 women, thus a woman's testimony have half the credibility of a man's in loans and deeds due to women's forgetfulness in monetary matters. There are other cases where a woman's testimony is equal to a man's. but the verse is explaining the conditions of giving loans and the necessity of writing it down and signing witnesses.   I think your problem with the  ** third verse  ** is about inheritance, but I explained it earlier: women are not supposed to spend a dime no matter how rich they are, providing for the house is the man's responsibility thus he was given double the portion. Consider you and your sister, when she marries she gets dowry, house, living costs, clothing, food etc all for free, if her husband refuses she has the right to take from his money that grants her decent living or divorce him and get alimony.  while when you marry ( assuming you are the boy)  you are supposed to provide all living costs for your wife, doesn't it make sense that you get more? 2 thirds for you, 1 third for your sister.   ** The fourth verse **  reads:  Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women). So good women are the obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded. As for those from whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and scourge them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them. Lo! Allah is ever High, Exalted, Great. (34)   I think your ( new) problem here is the "scourge" part.   First of all, the prophet said: the worst of you are the ones who beat their women  So beating the woman is a big NO is islam.  there is only one case, worst scenario, that allow you - not to beat the woman-  but scourge her, means: lash her arm lightly with a stick as thick as siwak ( the plan that Muslims  use for cleaning the teeth)  what's is this worst scenario?   Wife is rebelling ( what does this mean? I'll explain later)  What is the solution:  First: admonish , advice,  talks, remind her of your rights  If she doesn't listen  Then, second, sleep on different beds, show her how you are displeased  If that didn't effect her, then if you really must do it, you can lash her arm with a stick  What did the wife do to deserve such punishment?  It comes from the meaning of "rebellion of the wife" the Arabic word that is used in Quran is "نشوز " prounced: noshooz  Whad does noshooz means? Most or all the following combined:  She goes out of the house as she pleases She let stranger men into the house She travels without you knowing She disobey you in house matters She is refusing to have sex without reasons She abuses you verbally, abuses the children and your family and your mother etc.  If a woman does all that, or majority of those, she is considered "nashez", means she committed noshooz  What do you do?  As Quran says:  First admonish ( talk, talk talk)  If not, then sleep in different beds  If not, then scourge, don't slap the face, don't kick, don't cause any physical damage, only with a thin stick, lash her arm, the point is to give her physical pain.   It's mentioned in a hadith, that when the wife of prophet Job ( peace be upon him) disobeyed him is some matter ( she wanted to follow the devil's advice instead of God's, but this part is not authenticated), it's mentioned that Job swore to lash her 100 lashes after he is cured. When he was cured, God told him to take 100 thin sticks, group them together, and tap her gently once ( because she was good wife really). And it will be considered 100 lashes.   In this light we understand the word in Quran that's translated to "scourge", and under the said condition. Islam doesn't advocate beating of women, it's forbidden, it's looked at as type of injustice and using the man's power unjustly.. there is only one case that you can beat a woman ( to cause light pain, but no physical harm) it's considered last medicine for a severe case ( wife is destroying the marriage)   Finally, You can't just take one verse and come bashing Islam on reddit without knowing the 100 verses and hadiths that the set the rules and conditions for that verse.   OK?  Also, I apologize for my bad English, I'm just too tired to make things more readable, I'm sorry.  Last thing: I didn't right this for debate, but when I read your comment I said to myself: " ha ha, I know the meaning of the verses, this guy doesn't, he's ignorant jumping to conclusions" and I went to my business. But I remembered that knowing something about Islam makes you responsible for telling it to others and explaining it, if you get lazy or block the knowledge, God might take that knowledge from you.       
-	-	i replied to you original comment, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i81ny/muslim_tory_minister_says_pakistans_treatment_of/c21rah7)  by the way, does anyone know the code for adding new line?
-	-	I don't agree with you.  I think the only time I need to provide more context is when this additional context fundamentally changes the meaning of the quote.  If the quote I provide retains its meaning with or without context, then it is wrong to demand that I write a 10 page essay every time I want to criticize something.  So you failed to reach an agreement with me on this issue.
0	2	Most religious texts are sexist. They were fabricated in earlier times, where women were not even considered people.  As to ahmed's point, he's saying that whatever point OP was making is irrelevant since it is  because it places a stereotypes on *all* Muslims based on what their scriptures say; that all Muslims don't value gender equality which is not the case, case in point the article. 
-	-	You are right, however it explicitly says in the Qu'ran that it's message is valid for all times. Therefore it is ok to be sexist today according to Islam.
-	-	I cannot believe you people are this blind.  Verse [4:11](http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran/?Sura=4&amp;FromVerse=11&amp;ToVerse=11) states that a male takes a portion (of heritage) similar to two females. This only sounds sexist when you do not pay attention to the verse [4:34](http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran/?Sura=4&amp;FromVerse=34&amp;ToVerse=34) which states that males are OBLIGED to support (financially) related females.  The extra portion the male took would be used to support the female which took less money that is totally hers, since women are not required to support their families in Islam.
-	-	&gt;So?  Yea, that's every Muslim's reaction to the quotes I've provided.
-	-	oh. I forget, it is okay to have "consensual" sex with a 9 year old when you live by 1400 year old texts.  
-	-	&gt;Advancement in the interpretation is fine  Interpretation can only bring you so far.  Some shit in the Qur'an and ahadith is so bad that it cannot be rescued through mere reinterpretation.
1	4	Thank you for your contribution to reddit, you have helped advance the human race.
-	-	It's not. Sharia is any set of laws derived from the principles laid out in the Quran and Hadith as interpreted by one the major schools of Islamic jurisprudence; the Hanbali, Maliki, Jafari, Salafi and I think there's one more I can't remember. That there has been minimal juridical advance by any of these schools in about 800 years is another matter. 
1	4	&gt;80's sitcoms?  THAT....i would like to see
-	-	He suggested that it came from culture
-	-	Islam does not give or take away rights. Man made religions are not what gives anyone rights. The truth that all people are created equal with certain unalienable rights is self-evident, not defined by any book. Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness are the result of the practice of reason, not the result of any man made book.
1	4	Not the west, just assholes like yourself.
-	-	Exactly right.  "Innovation" is a strongly pejorative word in Islamic culture precisely for that reason.  EDIT: I mean specifically when discussing Islam.
-	-	fail
-	-	I believe she was married at 6 and the marriage was consummated at 9.
-	-	please read chungi's comment, it is as if you reply without even understanding what s/he wrote!  s/he said that "Sharia is any set of laws derived from the principles laid out in the Quran and Hadith as interpreted" see the word interpreted.  Advancement in the interpretation is fine and would in no way mean that the Quran is or isn't perfect.
-	-	no, that's illogical. it's similar to taking things out of context. if a verse depends on another verse or another hadith for explaining, conditions and circumstances, ** THEN YOU MUST ** bring all those together. or you'll be no different than .. well, the latest example i ran into was rush limbaough and his sound bites .. i lestin to american political shows and i cheer for conservatives, but that man is an idiot for his out of context bashing.

-	-	"Islam sucks, why don't Muslims ever speak out against injustice!!!!"  Muslim speaks out against injustice  "Islam sucks, look, look, even *they* admit that their societies are unjust"
-	-	This.   It's time to give these women rights that were given to them by Islam so long ago. 
-	-	A lot of people don't realize that sharia is not part of the Qur'an or any Islamic Text for that matter.  The gender discrimination/inequality is the result of culture, not religion.  Or at least that's how I understand it.
0	2	She might be right if the religion were based on "whatever you can find that you like most". Instead, it's run on a "whatever was written/decreed last is actually the real religion, and anything before that was written by Satan" system.
-	-	Her and every other human rights lawyer in Pakistan. 
-	-	So what does Qur'an say about women's rights?  Here's a sample:  [2:228](http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran/?Sura=2&amp;FromVerse=228&amp;ToVerse=228)  [2:282](http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran/?Sura=2&amp;FromVerse=282&amp;ToVerse=282)  [4:11](http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran/?Sura=4&amp;FromVerse=11&amp;ToVerse=11)  [4:34](http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran?Sura=4&amp;FromVerse=34&amp;ToVerse=34)
1	6	What!? Muslims denying basic human rights based on gender!? THIS ARTICLE IS CLEARLY RACIST PROPAGANDA BY THE WEST! 
-	-	The religion of peace.
0	1	When a group of people rely on a 1400 year old text to define human rights, they are fucked right from the get go. 
-	-	&gt;The gender discrimination/inequality is the result of culture, not religion.  Qur'an citations:  [2:228](http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran/?Sura=2&amp;FromVerse=228&amp;ToVerse=228)  [2:282](http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran/?Sura=2&amp;FromVerse=282&amp;ToVerse=282)  [4:11](http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran/?Sura=4&amp;FromVerse=11&amp;ToVerse=11)  [4:34](http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran?Sura=4&amp;FromVerse=34&amp;ToVerse=34)  I'm not even going to bother with ahadith.
-	-	No, hadith is not God's law. Hadith is a collection of sayings.
-	-	And to suggest that any "advance" is necessary is, by definition, heretical, as that would imply that the Quran isn't perfect. Since the Quran is perfect, by definition, and is the True Word Of God, any change implies that we're right and God is/was wrong.  
-	-	Ah, I am not sure if it's possible.  [I give up](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
-	-	&gt; that sharia is not part of [...] any Islamic Text   wat
-	-	it is completely unfair to tarnish all muslims because one extremist muslim lady has progressive thoughts.
1	4	Islam gives dignity to women. Just ask Muhammed how he *dignified* his nine year old wife.  *Bow chika bow wow*
-	-	Shari'ah is derived from the Qur'an and Hadith, but it is not a holy text.
-	-	Welcome to reddit
1	4	And you don't seem to realize that Islam is not like Protestant Christianity, where only things in the main holy text (bible/koran) are considered part of the belief system.
-	-	He is saying Islam is a sexist religion, and then provided proof.
-	-	Sharia is a law that was derived from the hadith, and Muslims believe it to be "God's law". So your point doesn't make sense.
-	-	&gt;A lot of people don't realize that sharia is not part of the Qur'an or any Islamic Text for that matter  And where did it come from, then? 80's sitcoms? 
1	4	Culture and religion are one and the same. Muslims say islam is a 'way of life' for them. A 'way of life' sounds like culture to me.
0	5	I'm not going to discuss if the Qur'an is man-made or not, because this isn't the topic.   But, sadly, it is not true that all of us believe humans are created equal. How many years were black people enslaved in America for example? When did they have the right to go to the same restaurant as the rest of Americans? 
1	6	So most Muslims have a shitty primitive culture unconnected to their common primitive shitty religion? What bad luck.
-	-	Did you read the article?
1	6	&gt;no, that's illogical. it's similar to taking things out of context.  Not at all.  The context you provided doesn't make the quotations I provided sound better or different.  The meaning of those four Qur'an verses is the same and sounds equally as shitty, before you added your blurb, and after.  &gt;if a verse depends on another verse or another hadith for explaining, conditions and circumstances, THEN YOU MUST bring all those together.   No, I must not.  Because you're essentially saying that if I have a problem with some feature of Islam, I must have a problem with all of it.  I reject that idea.  &gt;i lestin to american political news and i cheer for conservatives  I'm not surprised.  &gt;but that man (Rush Limbough) is an idiot for his out of context bashing.  He's an idiot for many reasons, and out of context bashing is the least of his sins.
-	-	No really, just ask muhammed's 9 year old wife, aisha, how it felt to be sexually assaulted.
1	4	Very good. :)  Thank you, and yes, everything you explained here I've already known.  I know how Muslims understand and approach these issues.  Nothing you say here has been a revelation or an eye-opener for me.  I'll upvote you because I want more people to see the true Islamic point of view before making decisions about Islamic doctrine and its relevance to this or that event in the world.  &gt;Finally, You can't just take one verse and come bashing Islam on reddit without knowing the 100 verses and hadiths that the set the rules and conditions for that verse.  Yes I can and I will.  I don't necessarily have a problem with every single feature of Islam.  I'm going to bring up those features which cause me the most grief.
1	4	Thank you very much for this.
-	-	Qur'an citations:  [2:228](http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran/?Sura=2&amp;FromVerse=228&amp;ToVerse=228)  [2:282](http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran/?Sura=2&amp;FromVerse=282&amp;ToVerse=282)  [4:11](http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran/?Sura=4&amp;FromVerse=11&amp;ToVerse=11)  [4:34](http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran?Sura=4&amp;FromVerse=34&amp;ToVerse=34)
1	4	    i ment empty line, like paragraph sperator              .    like above, but without the dot.
1	4	It's like a combination of [Canon Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law) and [Common Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law).
0	1	Ummm, looks like I am missing something here. Who is trying to convert you to Islam? Apart from the fact that your citation is completely irrelevant to my comment on the previous asshole, I do not see anyone trying to convince you about Islam. A fact that simply means that what you think is completely irrelevant, plus it is so stupid of you thinking you could "embarrass" me with an out-of-place citation.  One last thing, even though I have not met you or even talked to you, you seem to be one of those know-it-all freaks who troll religious people for fun. So just fuck yourself, or find another asshole to do it for you in case you are dickless, which most probably you are.
-	-	Then why are you complaining
1	4	&gt;by the way, does anyone know the code for adding new line?  Do you   mean like this   ??  If that's what you mean, then end your line with a double space.

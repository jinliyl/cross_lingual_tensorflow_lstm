-	-	Yes, I mostly agree with what you said (esp. second part), however your post was a factual "Reactor pool 4 was empty and the disaster is worse than Chernobyl".   There was no reference to a "he" in your post, I guess he = Michio Kaku, a guy whose existence I was not even aware of a few weeks ago. I have no opinion on his expertise, never read anything of him, never saw anything except excerpts of his interviews on the Internet. He could be as authoritative as Dr Nakamatsu for all I know.  Your statement was "reactor pool was empty", my reply is "it does not seem to be".

Obviously, I guess I do have to hold your hand.   &gt;Already worse than Chernobyl" means "Might be worse than Chernobyl later"  Nope, I mean that it doesn't make a difference whether it has already or will release more radiation, it definitely is worse than Chernobyl as in it is a disaster that is worse than Chernobyl. Quit it with your mental gymnastics and stop trying to put a spin on what I said. When you asked me to explain why it's worse than Chernobyl, you were asking because you didn't believe it is or would be, not because you didn't think it was right now but maybe in the future. 
1	4	I meant Arnie Gundersen, and I don't really follow Michio Kaku either. Thanks for letting linking to that article on reactor four.That is good news.

1	6	&gt;Reactor pool 4 was empty   Was it ? [it does not seem so](http://atomicinsights.com/2011/06/nrc-professional-staff-brief-very-good-news-unit-4-pool-never-dry.html)
1	8	Gladly. It will release more radiation if it hasn't already, it will contaminated more land if it hasn't already, the water table will be contaminated which is very bad, the reactor cores are burrowing into the concrete foundation, the concrete foundation has large fractures and fissures in it, they don't expect to achieve a cold shutdown for at least a year ( it does not look like they're going to meet that deadline), there are 3 nuclear reactors that have not only fully melted down but also melted through the containment vessels, and to top it all off, they have absolutely no idea what to do about it because they can't seal it in a sarcophagus like they did at Chernobyl for various reasons, and there is really no other solution. This kind of nuclear catastrophe should not have happened and, since it should have been such an unlikely occurrence, it was not planned for. If you don't believe me then you are in denial because I have said nothing that hasn't been widely reported on already. If you want a source, then use google. You're a big boy, you don't need me to hold your hand. 
1	5	You do realize that I said that he hasn't claimed anything that jeopardizes his stance as an authority figure and an expert, right? A lot of experts thought that reactor pool four was empty. That bit of news you linked me to is good news and recent news. Sorry for missing it, but, up to this point, most experts thought it was empty.  Also, they still don't know for sure if it was or wasn't completely empty, but what we do know for sure is that reactor cores were, with out a doubt, exposed to air and probably still are since reactor building four blew up and all the machinery and structures are in ruins. 
0	5	&gt; It will release more radiation if it hasn't already, it will contaminated more land if it hasn't already,  So basically, "Already worse than Chernobyl" means "Might be worse than Chernobyl later".  Got it.  It's like Harold Camping, if shit happens you get to claim your guess was due to foresight and not a guess.  &gt; the reactor cores are burrowing into the concrete foundation  And your proof that it's still the thousand+ Celsius inside the reactor that would be necessary to do this is.. what?  All actual evidence is that it's nowhere near that temperature anymore and won't be going back to that unless cooling is interrupted again.  &gt; there are 3 nuclear reactors that have not only fully melted down but also melted through the containment vessels  There's no evidence they've melted through their containment vessels, only their pressure vessels.  Go ahead, try to find real evidence of this (you're a "big boy" like you said, right?), then when you can't, ask yourself why the sites you were reading would lie to you.  There's a big difference between the containment vessels leaking water in places the core having actually left the containment vessel.
-	-	All of your links are to the same speculative Guardian story from 3/29.  Fast forward and that same source, the Guardian, [on 6/20 is all about how that worst case didn't actually occur](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/jun/20/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami-japan?INTCMP=SRCH).  But hey, we can just cherry pick things from early in the disaster when no one knew much about anything, right?  &gt; Nope, I mean that it doesn't make a difference whether it has already or will release more radiation, it definitely is worse than Chernobyl as in it is a disaster that is worse than Chernobyl.  ... How can it be worse than Chernobyl if it doesn't ever do worse things than Chernobyl?  I don't understand you at all.  Here, from that Guardian article since you seem to trust the Guardian as a source (I wouldn't), '*The "reasonable worst case scenario" envisaged ruptures at all three reactors in operation before the earthquake, and radiation leaks from six spent fuel ponds at the Fukushima site. [...] Even in this worst case scenario though, the accident was expected to cause less harm than Chernobyl'*.  So.. is your source wrong now that it disagrees with you?
-	-	We better be keeping an eye on Ft Calhoun as well.
0	5	don't mean to sound like an ass but is Dr.Kaku, actually qualified or knowlegable enough to be an expert on the current situation in Japan, or is it simply of his opinion, that it is a 'ticking time bomb'?
-	-	What does Michio Kaku have to do with this?
0	1	Michio Kaku's a fucking liar.  Everyone on that joke of a "news network" is.
-	-	He's Japan's version of Arnie Gundersen.  CNN doesn't bother to challenge pundits, they just want charismatic people to fill air time.
0	1	Please, do not insult the reddit holy cow, nuclear power.
1	6	funny you should mention that..  because the US media sure isn't. 
1	8	Dr. Kaku is a theoretical physicist. He is definitely an authority figure. He may have his biases, but he is definitely worth taking seriously. 
1	7	Actually, he's not "Japan's" version of anything -- he was born and raised in San Jose. Just a nitpick. Makes no difference of his opinions on this accident.
-	-	Is massive flooding in that facility imminent or just a dire possibility at this point?
1	8	Arnie Gundersen has proven to be very reliable in his predictions and has not said anything that jeopardizes his reputation as an authority figure and an expert.   Also, Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist, which is a title that should not be dismissed so readily. Both of these people should be taken seriously.
-	-	He's not Japanese.
-	-	Another 2.5-3ft and it floods just like fuushima. Friend, always watch the MSM propiganda, but never believe it. When they say its safe---run for your life.
-	-	I know what he is and have read snippits of his writings. but i am unsure if this theoretical physicist knows enough about nuclear energy crisis, surely it is more of an engineering problem.
1	8	&gt; Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist  Yes, but theoretical physics is a different field of study than applied nuclear physics or the industry of nuclear energy. One can be an expert in aerodynamics without having flown a jet.  Having not visited the Fukushima site himself, like everybody else he relies only on reports from observers about what's going on inside each of those reactors. He can speculate, and you can take him seriously if you like, but one must treat his analysis as only that.
0	1	&gt; Arnie Gundersen has proven to be very reliable in his predictions  Oh, you mean [like this when he claimed reactor 4's pool was empty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DZQzY_k2c)?  Or maybe [like this when he was claiming it was worse than Chernobyl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNJF4wHNTA4)?  Maybe he was confused because [he claims to have far more experience than he does](http://atomicinsights.com/2011/02/arnie-gundersen-has-inflated-his-resume-yet-frequently-claims-that-entergy-cannot-be-trusted.html).  The media loves him because he makes these big claims and they don't care when he's just bullshitting as it gets viewers.  The same situation exists with Kaku.  But it's not all the media's fault, they're feeding an increasingly uncritical and trusting population.
0	5	&gt; Maybe he was confused because he claims to have far more experience than he does.  Oh, this old hat. I keep forgetting about it.
-	-	Yes, it's a very complex problem and no one is sure what consequences the disaster will cause because a nuclear catastrophe of this magnitude has never happened before. All we know is that it's going to be bad. From an engineering perspective, Arnie Gundersen is a good source because he is a nuclear engineer with multiple decades of experience in the field. Michio Kaku is not an engineer, but I guarantee he has a very good understanding nuclear chemistry and a physicist of his caliber definitely has a vast knowledge base in science and a reputation to uphold, so I doubt he would readily make such claims if he was not sure they would pan out. Making himself look like a fool would be his own professional suicide.
0	1	&gt; and the disaster is worse than Chernobyl  It's released less radiation, contaminated less land, and harmed fewer people.  Explain. 
0	2	Reactor pool 4 was empty and the disaster is worse than Chernobyl.

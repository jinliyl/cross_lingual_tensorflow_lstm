-	-	In 1973 the graphs diverge begin to diverge, but until 1991 NK's economy appears to hold steady. To me, this indicates NK was lying for some time.
1	8	I think that "almost" might be the difference between going home and doing hard labor in a North Korean prison for the rest of your short life.
1	4	Clever. They're making sure that visitors from other governments, the Red Cross and other people are only able to get to places they've specifically set up to look nice. Germany did this as well, I believe.

1	4	They certainly don't have these delicious baby back ribs, though. Holding a gun is great i guess, but munching on a steak is better.  Military victory? Diplomatic Victory?  Nah buddy, *culinary victory*.

1	4	duly noted, thank you BelgianSexWaffle.
0	5	I've read that among reservist troops, and a lot of soldiers not manning the DMZ fortifications, malnutrition is becoming increasingly common.
0	1	they are not, at least not the ones that are guarding the border. according to the documentary "Yoduk Stories", the guards of the border can easily cross, but they don't want to for several reasons.   first of all, their families will most likely suffer, and get thrown in to the concentration camps. killed, tortured, idk.  Second, they are most likely fed well, and kept happy by the government.
-	-	North Korea had all the resources and infrastructure(natural resources and hydroelectric dams) to succeed economically. They were in a position to dominate South Korea.   My point is it took less than a generation for NK to go from economically viable to communistic destitution.
-	-	It was there before.  This is nothing new  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism#During_starvation  &gt;A more recent example is of leaked stories from North Korean refugees of cannibalism practiced during and after a famine that occurred sometime between 1995 and 1997.
-	-	thats it. zombies will come from north korea. communist north korean zombies. i give up, you'll find me in the corner, weeping for my life
1	7	This isn't really news. There is a book out called Nothing to Envy by Barbara Demick which chronicles the stories of six individuals as they live their lives through a fairly "decent" North Korean period and into the period of "decline" that occurred after the death of Kim Il-Sung and during the famine that ravaged the country. I use the terms "decent" and "decline" because the situation in Korea wasn't always this terrible. People used to have food. Now, they do not.  There was one passage in the book that really struck me. A bunch of women actually started up makeshift markets. Trying to avoid embarrassment by admitting that he couldn't feed his people, Kim Jong-Il kind of ignored their presence and didn't crack down on them. Various things were sold in these markets, but as times got worse, rumors of human flesh began to appear. The woman in the book was having a discussion with another woman who had claimed to have eaten human flesh. He summation was that "If you didn't know what it was, you would swear that it was beef or pork." 
1	6	When did cannibalism ever leave DPRK?
-	-	I don't know about you but I misread this as "Cannabis comes to North Korea" 
-	-	this isnt news. I remember also reading the government tells its people how to make "grass" cakes thru its national radio.

0	2	Great documentary on N. Korea called "State of Mind" I believe...
0	5	That is sad for a country that has so much viable land to grow edible vegetation.
-	-	korean quality.
-	-	I remember the "How To Cook Grass" book that came out in the 90s.
1	6	As sad as it is, I'm not surprised. When I lived in Korea my (adult) students told me about North Korean coworkers of theirs who had stories about markets full of human meat and human feces (for fertilizer). 
-	-	This isn't new news. I read somewhere that in the 1990's, people in North Korea were caught digging up freshly placed graves to eat the none decomposed flesh. [Isn't a direct source to digging up graves, but does say some stuff about 1990's North Korean cannibalism](http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A41966-2003Oct3?language=printer)

1	4	Mmm, I was being facetious (fecetious?), though it wouldn't surprise me if they had to feed that kind of offal to their animals.

-	-	it was a pun :)
-	-	Agree; catfish improved
-	-	As an American living in South Korea, I agree 100%.  I feel like a staggering amount of the culture shock they felt was simply dealing with life in an Asian society in general.  I'm not going to dare to say that life in South Korea remotely resembles that of the North, *however*, they share common cultural heritage.  With that said, a lot of stuff they witnessed for VG2NK could've been anticipated with a few pages worth of cultural and historical research.  I got the feeling that they were less reporters, and more like tourists.
0	2	I'm not surprised either. While 5 documented cases might not seem like a lot to some, that doesn't change the fact that these people are so desperate for food that they're willing to risk having their entire family thrown into labor camps.

0	1	One case of Cannibalism and you can draw the conclusion that they are now fucking eating other people to survive? Hilarious propaganda against communism as usual. Let's face it, majority of the people who have died in places like Cuba, Iraq, Iran and N. Korea over the years due to poverty could be directly attributed to the economic sanctions placed on them.

-	-	They went on the official government sanctioned tour of Pyongyang. It really is nothing special.
-	-	But that same comment can be said of almost any "official" tour of any country.  When visiting somewhere you're not always going to see the real culture within. No one wants to inject their disorder and poor into an international light.
0	2	yeah, it's a state run tour. guides hover over you and take you only to preplanned locations. visitors never get to see the real north korea. You are the type of ignorant audience member that the vice guide panders to.

-	-	You *DO* realize that you just described the plot from an episode of King of the Hill?
-	-	whatever was left after the cannabalism
0	2	Ironically addressed in Max Brooks' *World War Z*.  The entire population of North Korea disappears entirely, presumably into underground shelters.  Nobody is willing to go looking for them because A) they left behind more than a few booby traps, and B) zombies might have gotten into the shelters and they'd be risking letting a few million zombies back into the world.
1	4	All of those are excellent reads. I highly suggest them as well.

-	-	When reddit ran out replies, we turned to double posts.
1	6	Hmmm, a country that allows its infrastructure to fall apart, turns a blind eye to ever-increasing poverty and desperation, conducts widespread and unaccountable surveillance of its entire citizenry, sees nothing wrong with having a massive prison population held on ever weaker pretenses, run by a ruling class wholly insulated against the negative effects, all while funneling ever-increasing amounts of national treasure into a military that vastly outstrips any rational need, and whose existence is justified by dishonest caricatures of an insidious external "enemy" that in reality exists largely only in response to the nation's own violent antics and is actually unable or unwilling to inflict real harm.  Why does that sound so familiar...?
1	4	Yup.  But look on the bright side, a few generations of this and the immunities the surviving Koreans have will prove useful in developing treatments and cures to prion diseases.
0	2	Believe it or not, there are plenty of sources within North Korea that can and will leak things like this to the South. This is nothing compared to some of the information coming out of North Korea, which is far more damaging than mere cannibalism.

1	4	Wow.  I've never seen it expressed that way, but the parallels are striking.
-	-	Kim is his family name. Asian conventions place the given name after the family name. Thus, Jong Il is his name. Or Mr. Kim. Or asshat.
-	-	Why turn it away? Scared western imperialists attempting to placate the mighty Kim with gifts is a massive propaganda tool.
0	2	Exactly. That's why more people don't leave. If you escape they'll kill your whole family. If you try to escape with your whole family, you're more likely to get caught. also there is extended family.
-	-	**So... why did they use a picture of a food truck from Los Angeles?**  Edit: I just copied what shellboy said 3 times. North Korea is a fucked up place especially when Kim's son ran away to go to disneyland.  He could be sleeping with a bunch of women he would otherwise not have a chance with but would rather go to disneyland. ***Mind-motherfucking-boggling.***

0	2	are you kidding me? North Korea runs organized tours for foreign visitors. There are almost no restrictions on Americans who wish to join a tour of North Korea. There are a few US travel agencies you can go through to get on a tour. The Vice Guide people either did no research and blindly went to asia or deliberately deceived their audience to attempt to uphold some notion that N. Korea is impossible to get into. Their film shows all the locations that the preplanned state tour hits. All they saw was the same facade and stupid shows that every other foreign visitor gets to see.... they just added idiotic commentary.

-	-	human fecal matter is commonly used as a fertilizer in agrarian countries that have a high population density - parts of China, for example.
-	-	&gt;and human feces (for fertilizer).  I read that as "human faces", it generated quite a weird image in my mind.
-	-	A lot of countries around the world use human feces as fertilizer. I'm sure America did it too before septic tanks were phased out.   My mother said people used to come around the neighborhoods to pump out the septic tank, treat it, then sell it for fertilizer.

-	-	Mmm, Asian food is the best.
-	-	I don't always enjoy punny comments but when I do, I upvote.
-	-	Agreed. I quite liked 'Inside North Korea' with Lisa Ling, made by national geographic. In the documentary, Ling ventures into the countryside with a team of doctors performing sight-saving eye surgery for the poor while showing some thing I've never seen before. The one image that will always stand out in my mind is when they removed the bandages of the patients and they could see again. Did they thank the doctors? No. They all broke down, thanking their great leader profusely for his support. It was amazing how these people were so brainwashed to think that the man who caused their problems in the first place was the sole reason they had sight again. Really unbelievable. It just shows how manipulated the population is. Deprived of food, medical care, and other basic needs, they still worship their great leader like a God til the end.
1	8	I agree. North Korea has always had far more in terms of material resources. South Korea's most important resource is, and always has been, the intelligence, diligence, and determination her people.   Is still don't understand how you went from this:  &gt;[T]he economic divergence from South Korea was immediately felt after the Korean War.  to:  &gt;My point is it took less than a generation for NK to go from economically viable to communistic destitution.  Immediately=One Generation? Or am I misreading you original post?

0	2	North Korea is one of the hardest countries to enter in the world as a foreigner yet you, from your computer chair, are absolutely certain that the people who actually had access are incorrect.  I had to stop myself from rolling my eyes because the force generated from this gem of a concept might have blinded me permanently.
-	-	For purposes of turning a poor scrap of nation into an economic superpower?  Yes, one generation can be fairly described as "immediately".
0	3	I think it was more a response of fear rather than worship of the great leader.
-	-	But his last name is more recognizable than Smith, that is simply not the case with Kim. There are too many famous people named Kim other than Kim Jong Il.
-	-	The more you know!
-	-	Americans can visit NK on a goverment sanctioned tour surrounded by government agents of a a regime that is incredibly hostile to the United States, I'm aware. I guess this does make me the wrong one and NK is easily accessible to the average joe. Color me corrected.
-	-	How do you know, you've never seen it. :)
1	7	I can't help but notice the striking similarities to religious types, particularly American christians, who do the exact same thing.  Some doctor or rescue worker works for hours or days to help them, and all they can do is thank the omniscient, omnipotent deity who, according to their dogma, knowingly let them get into the situation in the first place.
-	-	Some of those facebook comments are priceless  "can't they grow soy?" 
-	-	I suppose it can be fairly described as immediately in terms of geological time too  Back to reality... I'd imagine the S. Koreans who lived through the 30 odd years of desperate poverty and ruthless dictatorial rule wouldn't dismiss that period by using a word like "immediately".   I know it's just semantics and I'm probably being a bit pedantic here, but I think it's important to get these details right. I agree with the rest of the OP's points. Well, er.... besides the "dusty vaginas" part. Not too sure what (s)he is getting at there.
1	4	Good thing our doctors get paid for it.
-	-	&gt; **North Korea** runs **organized** tours for foreign visitors.  You are absolutely correct, I'm sure.
1	6	Seriously? You're joking about forced cannibalism? That comment was in pretty poor taste.
0	2	Not as much as you'd think. I remember an amazing picture by a foreign visitor where soldiers hastily tried to line up in front of a farm tractor, but they weren't fast enough to completely cover up the UN logo on the tractor.
1	6	Not sure why you're getting so much hate, that documentary was mediocre at best.  There are better documentaries out there to recommend to people other than the Vice guide.
0	2	yeah it;s overrated, reddit loves it though
-	-	&lt;shrug&gt;  Easter Island showed that a society can resort to widespread cannibalism when they run out of food.  And the people with the best resistances to prion diseases tend to live in areas almost wholly lacking in high-protein foodstuffs.
-	-	I hear they eat souls too!
0	2	What percentage of rapes around the world go undocumented? You do realize 5 cases of cannibalism is a lowball figure of what is actually going on.  Cannibalism is arguably the most heinous and taboo activity that a human can engage in, which makes it that much more difficult to document.  
-	-	Rice is Asia's wheat.  It's not that hard to understand that it's a metaphor for Asia...
-	-	We have people starving here because they can't *afford* to eat.  in NK they're starving because they don't have any damn food.
1	6	Eh? Are you asking about eating spoiled meat or are you under the impression that humans are inherently poisonous?
1	8	Cannibalism is a reality when there is absolutely no other choice.  "Hilarious propaganda" makes me want to facepalm at how little you know about the realities of the world outside of your comfortable room.
-	-	1&gt;  Leverage.  The more authority that the U.S. can exert on the DPRK, the more likely they'll come to our negotiating table when we need them to.  See: President Carter bails out silly American tourist (parts 1, 2, 3, &amp; 16)  2&gt;  By keeping the DPRK at a level *just above starving* the US can theoretically prevent a chaotic situation.  The U.S. gains nothing by having the DPRK collapse if it creates a refugee crisis or Seoul On Fire/Japan Underwater.  Therefore, maintaining the Status Quo and letting S. Korea deal with the Kims is the US's main goal.

1	6	Really offtopic, but why Murphy?
0	2	No first hand personal experience but I can guarantee you that the level of misery in North Korea is on par with the worst in the world(worse than Haitan Mud cookies) and the economic divergence from South Korea was immediately felt after the Korean War. The Vice Guide to North Korea, which gives a glimpse of North Korea, scratches the surface of how terrible conditions are outside of its major cities.  I know of female relatives who visited their kins in North Korea (pre-TSA). They smuggled money through their dusty vaginas.

0	1	As opposed to saying "fuck you george" which is much more specific?
-	-	The Vice Guide is a terrible film on N. Korea. It's painfully obvious that the filmmakers shot and edited the film with little consideration for tempering their already ingrained notions of N. Korea being a strange country that no one can ever get into. Besides, they never went outside of the major cities. They were shown what every other foregin traveler is shown... a show put on by the government. It's not difficult to see what they saw, even Americans can go. 
-	-	&gt;and the economic divergence from South Korea was immediately felt after the Korean War.  Simply not true. NK economic divergence from their estranged SK kin was **not** apparent in the immediate aftermath of the Korean War. Remember, SK was a desperately poor nation until the 1980s. The economies of NK and SK didn't start to diverge until the late 70s and the drastic differences didn't arise until the collapse of the Soviet Union.

I'm sure there is widespread hunger but how this article can claim that there is extensive cannabalism from a few cases is baffling.  What people think they know about this country is disturbing. Because N. Korea is so closed off and so little is known about the country, people fill in the blanks with their own ideas. It's our stupidly primitive and innate drive to be curious about the unknown... just how people create ghosts and monsters to compensate for the mysterious.  Also, I hope people understand that those videos of little n. korean kids playing guitar and n. korean girls in a band are simply an extreme facade put on by a ultra paranoid country. Think about some of the most self-conscious people you know and how they come off with strange perfection and blunted affects.

-	-	I was under the impression that this is actually fairly common in North Korea for people outside of the "Chosen" city of Pyongyang. I've always been really intrigued by North Korea. It just seems very surreal that a place like it exists today. Here's a great documentary on North Korea involving children of the state, starvation and some secretly filmed video showing how bad it really is (to an extent). It actually goes into cannibalism when it begins to show drawings children made of people selling human parts.  http://youtu.be/xLpjNZA8PFY
0	1	It would be more akin to saying fuck you smith, therefore insulting a hell lot of people named smith
-	-	Kim is the most common surname in Korea. In Korea, the surname goes before the person's name. So, it would be like "Obama Barack" or "Bush George".  So Kim Jong-Il's name is more like Jong-Il Kim in America. That's why if you know a lot of Koreans, you've probably seen a lot of Koreans with the last name "Kim". Same with "Park" or "Lee", which are the second most common Korean surnames.
0	2	And considering the unbridled worship a certain recent ruler was able to command, to the point of some of his prominent supporters suggesting he simply take the throne and slaughter his enemies wholesale, I wouldn't rule out the same ruler/state/deity cult of personality showing up either.

Thus, the general spirit is that when something doesn't go perversely wrong, you can thank Murphy or Finangle for it.  Sort of a nerdier, lighthearted alternative to swearing to deities.
1	4	Haha forgot about that episode.  But let's be honest KotH is pretty relevant for just about anything.
-	-	For the fact that Americans can visit NK but not Cuba...it's not that hard to get into.   It's just that hard to see the real country behind the smoke and mirrors. 
-	-	You might not be aware, but Kim Jong Il hasn't migrated to the west.
-	-	Uh, a lot of them do, if you look at someone from East Asia who gets a driver's license in the US for example, their name would be listed as "Jong-Il Kim".  For example, I believe East Asians who came to America to play pro-sports would probably on official ID have their names listed Western style.  But some people who are famous enough will still end up being referred to by their Asian-style names, like Chow Yun-Fat or Yao Ming, probably because we're just so used to the way their name flows that way.  If someone said Yun-Fat Chow to me, I would be confused.  But everyday folks usually switch over depending on where they are.  But if you are talking about East Asians still in East Asia, then they would not (why would they?) and then usually the international press will refer to them in the name order that reflects their origin, so an international article about Kim Jong-Il wouldn't swap his name order.
1	4	Thank Murphy our finest minds have turned their attention to this sad situation.  I fully expect the problem to be solved by the weekend.
-	-	"they need to throw massive barbeque parties on the DMZ border every day, and blow the smell of the food towards the north.. any guards who smell it and want some are free to cross over and eat real food."
0	2	Very true.  When they ran out of food supplies in some areas, they ate their pets and livestock.  When those ran out they turned to insects.  When insects weren't enough, they turned to tree bark and grass.  When the land was stripped bare, they turned to the neighbors.  [Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader](http://www.amazon.com/Under-Loving-Care-Fatherly-Leader/dp/0312322216) details some of this.  To see the mindset of the average Korean, although with a bit of a different thesis than the previous book, I recommend [The Cleanest Race](http://www.amazon.com/Cleanest-Race-Koreans-Themselves-Matters/dp/1933633913) by [B.R. Myers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXPksdShNK0).  I've yet to read *The Aquariums of Pyongyang* but am getting around to it.

-	-	I honestly thought it was a PSA mobile kind of a thing bringing attention to the problem of hunger in North Korea.  I figured the "menu" would have information on a typical NK diet, and about how malnutrition was such a problem.  [I couldn't have been more wrong.](http://losangeles.grubstreet.com/2011/02/pyongyang_express_rears_its_ug.html)  It was an advertisement for the game Homefront.
1	6	Globalpost is strange like that.
-	-	It's rare to get a picture in North Korea, as devices capable of photography or recorded are banned for non-government usage.
1	6	Would you rather see a picture of some guy eating some other guy?
-	-	That's Soylent Yellow.
-	-	no ad-block?
-	-	Our special for today is Kim Jong Eel.
-	-	a male guard who could not bear his hunger killed his colleague using an ax, ate some of the human flesh and sold the remainder in the market by disguising it as mutton
0	2	Once again American sanctions do their job. Good job Americans, look at what you're doing to more innocent people.

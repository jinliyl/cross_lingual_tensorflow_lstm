0	1	Can we kill him now? I mean the man has said it himself that he will once again become a global menace if given enough breathing room; so let's just take the fucker out and end this war once and for all. 
-	-	If he does it would be a legitimate resistance to belligerent occupation and naval blockade.
0	1	Can we stop upvoting this please. It's baseless drum pounding. What the hell is he going to do? bomb countries thousands of miles from his country with his magical air force?  It's not our fight, they have to sort it out themselves. So it turns out France have been arming the rebels. That's great. Another term for rebels is insurgents. So why are we on one side of the fence in Libya and another in Afganistan?   We need to get the fuck out of the middle-east and concentrate on sorting our own countries out before we all go bankrupt.  *** EDIT ***  Downvote, away! If you genuinely think you are better off as we pour tax money into bombing countries we've never been to before, you must be the luckiest person alive!  I would rather spend our money on doctors, teachers, firefighters, nurses, local police, childcare and disease prevention.
1	4	Remember guys take everything with a grain of salt...Amnesty International never did find evidence of the mass rapes or mercenary armies or air strikes...and really it just sounds like more talk which dictators do best.  They lied to get you to go along with Iraq they will lie to you to get you to support another conflict. Yes he is an asshole but Saddam was too and we gave him the weapons to attack Iran. The West sold weapons to Gaddafi as well. It is not good vs bad it is just foreign policy and it is time for Libya to liberalize..  http://i.imgur.com/muPFf.jpg 
-	-	That d00d is just sealing his coffin, isn't he?
-	-	Nato is spreading democracy with bombs and killing civilians, they can't expect that people will not fight back with same measures...
0	1	[Interview with Gaddafi's son](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMugPQC4ZY&amp;feature=channel_video_title)  The whole Lybia thing is a coup basicly in the guise of a humanitarian help plan. It is trying to destroy the powers of Lybia for special interests. Don't believe the story about soldiers raping woman and Gaddafi suposedly giving out condoms. Neither should you believe this.  Gaddafi does not have the technology to send a missiles to europe its pure bullshit. And for fuck sake people be skepticle for once, not all news is true infact most is propaganda especially the American news, you guys seem to be unable to learn from your mistakes.  
-	-	Someone a bit upset over his wanting to change Africa to s gold standard go figure, let the bombs begin
0	3	He cooperated with the war on terror, and refused to allow Al-Qaeda into Libya. He's not a good man, but he is not a monster. He did not launch strikes against America or Europe, it is America and Europe that started the war against him. 
-	-	Leave Gadaffi alone!
-	-	Just keep digging that hole deeper.
-	-	Silly rabbit.  Only the US and NATO are allowed to bomb urban centers.
0	3	I live in Italy and basically Gadhafi has tried to bomb italian soil for more than a decade (none of the bombs reached our territory).  The things he is saying somehow resembles the things Saddam used to say about "the mother of all battles". Basically, Gadhafi is one desperate man trying to mantain power for as long as possible, brainwashing his weak supporters and promote "democracy?! freedom?!" with fear etc.  I do not necessarily agree with the presence of NATO troops, aircrafts in Lybia but it is a "necessary evil" (like Hobbes used to say). He and his men has killed, tortured, molested, destroyed families, homes and hopes. NATO is there to establish peace and remove another dangerous mind from this infected reality.  The fact that he threathens Europe somehow makes me laugh... The only way he could reach the West is by promoting terror... but a war?? naaaah...
-	-	&gt;Support of his people?   Please stop making up stuff. Tripoli is the last remaining pro-Gadaffi bastion. The rest of the country are risking their lives daily to stop him. At this point almost every Libyan has directly lost family members to Gaddafi's regime, they will not stop until he pays in blood. 
0	1	&gt;I hope they see reason and just take out infrastructure like a couple of bridges and some locks and avoids casualties  If Gaddafi attacks Europe then the anti-war movement would die out immediately. **Every. single. European.** would support a full-scale retaliation against Gaddafi until he's in the fucking ground. 
1	6	hey I read an article that President Obama helped this girl meet Justin Beiber after she wrote a letter to him. Why don't you ask him to hook you up and nuke Gaddafi so you can get some hot, killing machine action?
-	-	lol wut?
1	8	I didnt know families made homes in radar stations and tanks. Do you have any idea who you're feeling sorry for? It is amazing how people will completely ignore the crimes commited by tyrants if it means expressing your bias against the west by going on about imaginary deaths or exaggerating unfortunate incidents involving the west. Disgusting.
0	1	&gt;but he's the bad guy?  Gaddafi is attempting to exterminate his own people via mass genocide. His forces have gang-raped thousands of women, children, and infants. It's hard to find a Libyan who hasn't lost someone at the hands of Gaddafi's brutality.   So yes, he is the bad guy. Can you fuck with that logic now? 
-	-	The only comment with logic and skepticism and here you are down in the thread. Redditors can be a bunch of morons sometimes look at them, this whole page seems to be a Fox community comment section.   Ignorant Americans.
-	-	Because the rebels in Libya and the brutal Taliban are exactly the same people despite being on two different continents right buddy?
-	-	Usually I don't advocate the use of such terse dismissals as "lol wut," but if anyone wants to use them, an opportunity has presented itself.
-	-	No, it was Gaddafi who started the war when he attacked his own people.
-	-	Excellent rebuttal.  I admire how your clever use of fact and logic have revealed the weaknesses of my argument.  Well played, sir.
-	-	All you could come up with is a [wikipedia](http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/wikipedia-founder-discourages-academic-use-of-his-creation/2305) link? Seriously?

-	-	&gt;In Libya the entire population wants to overthrow Gaddafi and end his brutal regime. It's a revolution.  And yet it is well documented (outside the US mainstream media) that Qaddafi has loyalists and that the rebels face opposition both from loyalists and neutral parties that do not wish to be ruled by the rebels.  It is a civil war.
-	-	So you're European and support the idea of Gaddafi attacking and destroying targets in Europe? I wish us Americans could give you guys some of our excess patriotism and nationalism. There's way too much of it in the U.S., but in Europe it is clearly lacking. 
1	4	&gt;It isn't about helping some poor rebels or anything like that.  But it is. Of course there are always ulterior motives involved in human conflicts. I'm sure oil is one of them. But that **does not** change the fact that innocent civilians are being systematically hunted down by Gaddafi forces and raped or murdered. The Libyan population is united in their opposition to Gaddafi and they will not stop until the man is gone. They asked us for help and we obliged. 
-	-	[Gaddafi's treatment of Libyans:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Libyan_civil_war#Treatment_of_protests)
1	7	[Gaddafi's response to protesters:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Libyan_civil_war#Treatment_of_protests)  *"The Libyan government employed snipers, artillery, helicopter gunships, warplanes, anti-aircraft weaponry, and warships against demonstrations **and funeral processions**, and security forces repeatedly fired at protesters with **live ammunition**. Amnesty International reported that writers, intellectuals and other prominent opposition sympathizers **disappeared** during the early days of the conflict in Gaddafi-controlled cities, and that they may have been subjected to **torture** or **execution**."*  *"Amnesty International also reported that security forces **targeted paramedics** helping injured protesters. In multiple incidents, Gaddafi's forces were documented **using ambulances in their attacks.** Injured demonstrators were sometimes **denied access to hospitals** and ambulance transport. The government also banned giving blood transfusions to people who had taken part in the demonstrations. Security forces, including members of Gaddafi's Revolutionary Committees, stormed hospitals and removed the dead. Injured protesters were either **summarily executed** or had their oxygen masks, IV drips, and wires connected to the monitors removed."*  *"Military commanders **summarily executed** soldiers who refused to fire on protesters. The International Federation for Human Rights reported a case where **130 soldiers were executed**. Some of the soldiers executed by their commanders were **burned alive**."*  *"The International Federation for Human Rights concluded that Gaddafi is implementing a strategy of scorched earth and seeks to eliminate and suppress Libyan citizens who stood up against his regime."*  *"Human rights groups and aid workers had previously documented rapes by loyalist fighters during the war, including the rape of children. Some of the children raped were as young as eight. Aid workers reported that some **children were being forced to watch their mothers raped and their fathers killed, before being beaten.** Some of the rape victims were reportedly infected with HIV."*  
0	3	&gt; They started off protesting in mid-Feburary peacefully until Gaddafi soldiers started violently cracking down.  Like I said, storming a military barracks/armory is not a mark of a peaceful protest.   &gt; After that, the protestors started getting violent.  Violent peaceful protestors. Pathetic.  &gt; They only turned to foreign powers after realizing they could not take on Gaddafi's entire military head-on.  This makes them traitors and should be killed off. Nothing worse than traitors.  &gt; Also, back to the OP, Gaddafi was always a monster.  Labelling someone a "monster" is childish. He chose/supported sides that you disagreed with. That's life.   &gt; I honestly doubt he helped us with terrorism out of the kindness from his heart. More to improve economic relations with the world.  You make it sound like this is a bad thing. In politics, there is only self-interest. Nothing more, nothing less.
-	-	Citation?  Given the barrage of pro-war propaganda issued in support of intervention in Libya, I hope you have a credible source.
0	3	&gt;Because the "rebels" have overtaken most of the towns with the help of NATO and the people fear if they show support in those towns they will be killed.  Source?  &gt;and the MSM hiding this fact  Source?  &gt;So the people supporting Gaddafi in the video are supporting him because they lost their family members  Source? 
1	6	Europe is part of NATO bub.   They have veto power under your argument. All nations need permission from a mythological "international community" to take action in their national interests. But let's play your game. Why should China have veto power on the right of another nation to act in its own best interests?
-	-	I'm sure that will send NATO scurrying for safe ground...

-	-	&gt;Actually, that is not true. The Kurds of Iraq and the Northern Alliance of Afghanistan wanted the US involved as it would benefit them. Same with the rebel leaders.  Not comparable. Only small fractions supported the U.S. in Afghanistan/Iraq. In Libya the entire population wants to overthrow Gaddafi and end his brutal regime. It's a revolution.   &gt;Had Bush started this war, Reddit would have been much more skeptical of the pro-war talking points.  This has nothing to do with U.S. politics. This is a civil war between Gaddafi and the Libyan population, which are assisted primarily by Europe. The U.S. is only playing a minor support role. 
1	4	I do not support the rebels for a number of reasons, one of them being the likelihood of a return to Islamic fundamentalism to Libya should the rebels win.  Qaddafi has resorted to strong-arm tactics and brutality to maintain power and control over the entirety of Libya over the last 40 years.  However, the likelihood of a genocide or large-scale massacre in response to the rebellion is small and serves only as pro-war speculation and propaganda.  As for your rhetorical abuse of Rwanda:  do stop.  We had peacekeepers in place in Rwanda, and they could have at least greatly reduced the numbers of casualties simply by making their presence known via numerous patrols.  The situation compares not at all to Libya, in which the West is taking advantage of internal turmoil to pursue its geopolitical goals.  That is not at all worthy of praise.  What is most frustrating about US/NATO wars dating from the intervention in the former Yugoslavia is that there is always a group of useful idiots willing to swallow the propaganda and lend the wars domestic support.    Remember that next time a Republican administration starts a war and the republicans follow blindly.
1	4	Outrageous!  He is threatening to copy standard US operating procedure in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Doesn't he understand that only NATO has the right to conduct house-to-house searches?  However, I did manage to find [evidence](http://www.sott.net/articles/show/226142-Muammar-Gaddafi-calls-on-Libyans-to-resist-colonialists) of unanimous support within Libya for Western intervention:  &gt;"These were ordinary people, asleep in their homes, not soldiers," one man shouted. "Where is democracy when they are killing children?" cried another, gesturing at the infant's fresh grave. "The people who did this are the terrorists, shedding the blood of innocent Muslims."   Oh wait.  He was railing against the NATO bombing that had killed his 3 month old niece.  However:  &gt;"No one knows how this will end," said a worried taxi driver, negotiating the eerily empty streets. "But this is an internal Libyan problem. The French and British should understand that. People are afraid of these cruise missiles."   Oh.  Maybe I'm not good at this.  I'll just shut off my brain and tune into CNN later to find out what my opinion should be.  Thanks for the help.
-	-	&gt;The difference between Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya is that the people in Iraq and Afghanistan didn't want us there from the start.  Actually, that is not true.  The Kurds of Iraq and the Northern Alliance of Afghanistan wanted the US involved as it would benefit them.  Same with the rebel leaders.  The one important difference between Iraq/Afghanistan and Libya - as far as most Redditors are concerned - is the fact that the former wars were started by a Republican president while the latter was started by a Democrat.    Had Bush started this war, Reddit would have been much more skeptical of the pro-war talking points.
1	6	Like I said, I agree that there are probably ulterior motives including oil. But how exactly does that change the fact that Gaddafi is a crazed fascist who is currently attempting to eradicate his own people? What do you propose? Stand idle and watch him commit mass genocide?   &gt;How come the US isn't in Somalia, Congo, hell, how many nations in Africa could use the dire help the west is giving Libya?  Because the Arab Spring never reached Africa. The people there aren't revolting against their governments on the same magnitude as in Libya.
-	-	Tell that story to the Korean peninsula. The purpose of the UN was to give the USSR and Allied powers a negotiating table after WWII to prevent another full scale world war. With the Warsaw Pact gone it has long since served its purpose. No country on earth needs the permission of the UN to govern in its own best interests, nor should it. 
0	3	&gt; But how exactly does that change the fact that Gaddafi is a crazed fascist who is currently attempting to eradicate his own people?  Holy moly. That's one loaded sentence.   If there was an uprising in America, would the group be labeled rebels or terrorists?  Would the attempt to squash this rebellion be called "eradication" or "attempt to restore peace and order"?  I guess it would depend on who controlled the media, right?  Do you think that NATO and the US would help Libya if it didn't have any oil?  The US was secretly helping the rebels just two-three weeks after they started the "rebellion". Without that help, they probably wouldn't have gotten as much control as they did. Without that much control, Gaddafi probably wouldn't use as much violence to stop them.   You sound like the kind of guy who will blindly accept anything bad about Gaddafi without asking yourself if it is just war propaganda. 
-	-	So when the rebels asked us for help we should have ignored them? Nice morality you have there. You are the reason Rwanda happened, but I suppose you support our lack of action their too?
-	-	My point is that by your reasoning the US should go to war against its own military.
-	-	You might want to check out the guy your talking to username for a better understanding of his position.
-	-	Libya now holds an unfortunate record. It is the country which has the longest experience of aerial bombardment. Libya was first bombed in 1911, by Italy.

1	4	Wow...  a "downvoted-because-it's-too-radical-left" comment I actually agree with. Don't see that every day.
-	-	wtf are you talking about?
1	4	It would wake people up to the fact that the world has become to small to feel invulnerable to threats from far away and how stupid it is to allow their governments to just attack other people for what ever reason they see fit.  I hope they see reason and just take out infrastructure like a couple of bridges and some locks and avoids casualties

-	-	Well since I downvoted you I also downvoted 2akurate
1	6	Why? Seriously, why do you think we should give Mali veto power on killing a guy that has pledged to murder our citizens? It is in our national interest, not to mention that of Libya. Why would we need the permission of every tinpot dictatorship in the world?
1	4	With threats like thay I think it is safe to say national security is allowed to override some fragile international will
-	-	The Taliban are not the insurgents. Insurgents want us out of their country. 
-	-	&gt; No, it was Gaddafi who started the war when he attacked his own people.  Yes, "his own people" who sided with foreign powers and have been armed to the teeth to overthrow the government. These peaceful protestors who stormed a military armory and armed themselves ( not to mention killed the soldiers guarding the armory ). If China armed a bunch of morons who decided to overthrow the US government, how quickly do you think they'd be killed? 
-	-	After much fumbling with auto-complete, done.
1	8	Nef beat me to it, those mass rape reports were false, like the throwing babies out of incubator stories in gulf war v1.0.No-one is paying attention to racial cleansing done by the rebels though are they, sorry, i mean CIA funded freedom fighters.Enjoy your fox news.
-	-	&gt;Gaddafi is attempting to exterminate his own people via mass genocide.   Seriously?  You seriosuly believe this nonsense?  Qaddafi has been in power for 40 years, and has maintained that power by crushing dissent, not going on wild genocidal binges.  I would have thought that the lead-up to the Iraq War would have led us to be more skeptical of pro-intervention propaganda.  The fact that people still believe ludicrous nonsense such as the unfounded claims of impending genocide or that Qaddafi was forming viagra-fed rape teams is a testament to the stupidity of the masses.  I would have hoped the average Redditor would have been above this.
-	-	The gang rapes were a lie, according to what I've read.
-	-	you and what army?
-	-	Leave it to Muammar to double down on the insanity.
-	-	Every day I pass the discotheque where Gaddafis goons planted their bomb. Three were killed instantly, 25 got seriously injured. So yes, I was never very much in favour of the appeasement policy towards Gaddafi, and I very much hope they catch and roast him over a fire. 
0	5	&gt;We can't relate to the suffering we are causing.   You got it the wrong way. **You can't relate to the suffering that is happening there at the hands of Gaddafi.** The man is a lunatic fascist that is hell-bent on eliminating anyone who questions his authority. Few countries have shown this level of open aggression against its own population, not even Burma or North Korea are doing the kind of shit that Gaddafi is currently pulling.   The Libyan population begged us for help as they were being butchered. What kind of sick person is going to say no and just watch another Rwanda unfold?  &gt;the only right action would have been to decapitate the regime day one  That's what they tried. But sadly Gaddafi is a hard man to kill. 
-	-	Some europeans (and I say that as a european myself) suffer from a bout of pseudo-intellectualism in which any act of violence is frowned upon, *even* if you use violence to succesfully defend yourself or use violence to defend others from violence.  In that twisted worldview, you should always use diplomacy, even when the other party says 'A' and does 'B'. 
1	4	After ***reading*** your posts I realized that you're like a ***walking***, talking ***propaganda*** machine.  edit:  There are these people in Afghanistan and Iraq that have been known to [rape innocent people](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3w2mGQ7V3Q), [killing innocent civilians](http://www.alternet.org/world/96205/u.s._accused_of_killing_76_civilians_in_afghanistan_airstrike/) when bombing them. The US and NATO should send in an army to fight these bastards!  ...oh shit
1	4	You are so naive. If Libya didn't have oil NATO and the US wouldn't bother to help them even if they asked. You wouldn't even know if they'd ask for help.   How come the US isn't in Somalia, Congo, hell, how many nations in Africa could use the dire help the west is giving Libya? Because they already have the leaders they want in those nations or the nation doesn't have any valuable resources.  It literally has *nothing* to do with helping some rebels. It's all about oil. They only play the innocent civilians angle to convince people like you that they should be in this war. 
0	1	It is not that I really want it to happen, I can understand that it would happen and I hope that it would remind people on how bad war actually is. If someone starts hitting you I would only think it normal that you started fighting back so he stops doing that.    We live in fear of terrorist strikes and are all to keen to send people out to ruin the lives of people in other countries.  We can't relate to the suffering we are causing. Yes plenty of people will be angry when shit hits the fan but that anger will subside and make people wiser.  If interfering in an other countries affairs had been ok the only right action would have been to decapitate the regime day one. Now we are making libya poor for no reason what so ever.

1	4	Your issue seems to be more with the fact that your country is in the UN. The very reason for the UN's existence is to provide methods of diplomacy and to prevent war, which is why permanent members have the right to veto. Countries don't need to be a part of the UN but if they join they need to accept the rules -it's just like any other club, society or organisation.
-	-	I am 100% against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in case you didn't know. I was against them from the very start.   The difference between Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya is that the people in Iraq and Afghanistan didn't want us there from the start. There never was a civilian uprising in Iraq or Afghanistan. A great deal of Iraqis supported Saddam and a very great deal of Afghanis supported and still support the Taliban, hence it was pointless to invade those countries. They never wanted any "help" from the U.S.  That's where the difference with Libya comes in. They started the fight against Gaddafi on their own. They started the revolution. They asked us for help.

1	4	In 1965, after coming to power and confronted with the evidence of US assassination plots in various parts of the world, President Lyndon Johnson famously stated that the US was “operating a damned Murder, Inc.”  In 1976, the **Church Committee**, which conducted the Senate investigations into CIA assassination plots, concluded that *a policy of assassination “violates moral precepts fundamental to our way of life.”* An executive order issued in the wake of the committee explicitly barred the practice.  There was, of course, never a golden age of American imperialism. However, the past 35 years have witnessed a collapse of any pretense of legality and a democratic accountability. A policy of state killing is the culmination of a process that includes unending wars of aggression, torture, detention without charge, and the erosion of democratic rights in the United States itself. This has been closely bound up with the transformation of social relations within the US, the rise of a parasitic financial aristocracy and the extraordinary growth of social inequality.  Policies like pursuing Gaddafi’s assassination as military strategy will have profound consequences. The Obama administration and the American ruling class have established their willingness to extra-judicially kill anyone they view as an obstacle. It is not only a warning, moreover, to political organizations or heads of state in foreign countries; there can be no doubt that US government personnel would utilize similar measures against any significant domestic opposition.

-	-	Beyond supporting the rebels to nail Gaddaffi with absolute minimal NATO assistance, I want the U.S. to have nothing else to do with that conflict.

I've talked to people who where vehemently against European and U.S. involvement in Libya, but after hearing him say this they aren't so sure anymore. By threatening innocent European civilians he's sealed his fate.  I guess he really enjoys getting bombed.

In recent years, the country which has veto'd the most resolutions has been the USA - [Source](http://www.globalpolicy.org/security-council/tables-and-charts-on-the-security-council-0-82/use-of-the-veto.html)  I've deduced from your previous posts you are from the USA. In relation to the article, he has not pledged to murder your citizens. 
0	3	&gt;Please stop making up stuff.   The video was not made by me.  &gt;Tripoli is the last remaining pro-Gadaffi bastion.  Because the "rebels" have overtaken most of the towns with the help of NATO and the people fear if they show support in those towns they will be killed.  &gt;The rest of the country are risking their lives daily to stop him.  The video portrays a different picture and the MSM hiding this fact does not increases my confidence in that viewpoint.  &gt;At this point almost every Libyan has directly lost family members to Gaddafi's regime, they will not stop until he pays in blood.  So the people supporting Gaddafi in the video are supporting him because they lost their family members..point taken.

It's just about oil.  I also love the way you see things. Don't support a war against him? Then you must support a war against *us*! It's not like you can be against both!

0	1	&gt; If Gaddafi attacks Europe then the anti-war movement would die out immediately. Every. single. European. would support a full-scale retaliation against Gaddafi until he's in the fucking ground.  Which is why Gaddafi might probably only do that if he's clearly going to lose in a few days.
-	-	How do you know it's not just war propaganda? 
-	-	Sources? Links? Evidence?
-	-	Honestly, you need to grow up.  I've seen your drivel all over this website in the past year and it's getting stupider and stupider.
1	4	He openly said on international TV that he was planning on going "from house to house, killing every single rebel in Benghazi". People like you are the reason Rwanda happened.

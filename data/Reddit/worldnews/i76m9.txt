0	2	&gt;300,000 Euro is small.  For a corporate CEO, maybe. But for the average farmer, 300,000 income is hog heaven.  &gt;We're discussing the idea of subsidization, but you've just pointed out an implementation detail...  Hair-splitting - as if you could have the former without the later.   EU citizens lose, because they have to pay for the subsidies with their taxes, and in stores for higher import prices, because of EU protectionism.   The infamous "banana wars" are a case in point, during which the EU tried to force inferior fruit on its consumers by keeping Latin-American bananas out of the market with quotas and tariffs.  
-	-	Yes. The 1921 figures are from wikipedia. I had to do a little digging to find the exchange rate between the German mark and the Dollar in 1958 and I found [this site](http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/projects/currency.htm) which lists it at 4.2  Edit to reply to your edit: Yes in real value Germany paid more. As I said I just wanted to correct your incorrect facts which stated, and I quote, "nominally".  And no I do not concede your point. Germany's GDP grew by 1500% between 1970 and 2009 in today's US dollars. I don't have the numbers for 1921 but I'm going to take a guess and say that it's GDP was much, much smaller than it was in 1958.  We can therefore assume that the amount Germany paid to the EU was a very fraction of its GDP at a time when Germany was growing exponentially, whereas the amount demanded 1921 was a large part of its GDP when Germany was in terrible economic conditions.
0	2	Agreed. The free trade zone did everything that European countries needed. The Euro removed the minuscule transaction costs of dealing in several currencies and the associated risk of volatility, but it came with a rigidity and an agenda for economic homogeneity that was never going to be realised. If you build a car mostly from racing car parts, but include odd bits such as the wheels from a farm cart, the result is not going to be harmonious. To hope that a wooden wheel will magically transform itself into one of Mr Michellin's more delicate creations whilst on the track was never more than a silly dream. 
-	-	Leaked papers suggest that there was a Kohl-Mitterand folie a deux, withthe French terrified of the Germans and the German political elite terrified of its own people. The Euro (and the "ever closer union") would manage these concerns. Problem was that driving withthe eyes firmly in the rear view mirror tends to miss problems up ahead, such as how an ageing, "teach the world to sing" Europe will deal with Asia. 
0	3	A more likely explanation.  With the unfortunate consequence that today Europe   is facing the results of a Eurozone *folie a dix-sept*.
-	-	&gt;Without the Euro we couldn't have managed the two crises that happened after the banking industry got completely deregulated.   &gt;So here the Euro did save jobs!  Wait just a little longer, until Greece finally has to restructure her debts.  That will cause some major trouble in your financial sector.   Plus the PIIG states are going to have more unemployment, because of the austerity measures imposed on them.  So they will not be able to keep importing as much from Germany as they did in the past. Then jobs will be lost there, too.  &gt;Without the Euro especially the southern European countries could have devalued their currencies to stop that but they can't do that anymore so they are forced to buy our shit (see: Greece).  Instead, they used the unified interest rate in the Eurozone to borrow huge amounts of money. Which is now proving worse than any currency devaluation, because it does not increase their comparativeness on the world market.   &gt;but they can't do that anymore so they are forced to buy our shit   That statement makes no sense - why were they "forced to buy your stuff"?  Buying is a voluntary activity. Not having a devalued currency actually means that you can buy more. Of course, if you are doing it with borrowed money, like the Greeks, sooner or later you will end up in trouble.   To summarize: Germany as an exporter would have done just as well with the Mark, German employees and the unemployed just as badly.      
-	-	Again, I don't think that (low) German unemployment was or is due to its terms of trade. The extraordinarily high skill levels that the nation deploys keeps it competitive and rich. However, not everyone has those skills. It is usually quicker to automate the job out of existence rather than to train someone up to it, even were they willing or able to train. Consequently, the threshold for minimal employability at German wage expectations continues to rise.   That dynamic is also true for everyone else, but here the tendency is often for the wages to fall because they do not have the productivity base of Germany, the US or similar nations.   You can see this really clearly in developing countries, for which China is a deadly competitor. If you want to continue in - say - textiles, you have to beat China either in productivity or by wages. Some have been able to make the productivity leap, but many more either pay lower real wages than they did a decade ago, or have left the industry. 
0	1	I disagree with the generalization, especially economically, but I do see your point. But they gave up that option when then took up the Euro.  I think though that we also have to look at their military spending. As long as they are shoveling a huge portion of their rather meager GDP into a military that they believe is capable of defending them against their oft provoked neighbors, I think they will have a hard time paying their bills.   *I just noticed those reposts. Fuck Android. Fuck it all to hell. 
-	-	&gt;And no I do not concede your point.  &gt;Yes in real value Germany paid more  Your own figures disprove you.  &gt;As I said I just wanted to correct your incorrect facts  They are from Nial Ferguson, see the quote.   
-	-	&gt;an agenda for economic homogeneity that was never going to be realised.  To achieve economic homogeneity in the EU it would take   - massive transfer payments from the richer to the poorer member states   - strictly centralized decision making for the members' fiscal, economic, labor, social, and educational policies, all the way down to like tax rates and job training.   Transfer payments would be highly unpopular and economically harmful for the donors, and open to abuse by the receivers. Centralized policies would make national parliaments purely decorative, and so greatly reduce the democratic self-determination of the people of Europe.   How the Eurozone of 17 states, which barely hold together as it is, could be made to decide on, and implement, detailed policies for its members is anybody's guess.   The thought occurs that e.g. an Italian politician, charged with determining Irish economic policy on the EU level, may lack both knowledge on the subject, and interest in the consequences of his decisions for the Irish. He or she may be more interested in using the process to benefit his own Italian constituents, because their votes keep him in office.   
1	6	* WWI - Bulgaria in pact with Germany - War lost * WWII - Bulgaria in pact with Germany (Axis) - War lost * 1955 - Bulgaria sign the Warsaw Pact established at the Soviet Union’s initiative - 1991 Pact disestablished.  * 2007 - Bulgaria joined the EU ... ???

-	-	down with the jewish european union
-	-	TBH it isn't the union that did this. The recognition that we couldn't go on like we did both put an end to the wars and created the climate in which the EU could exist.
1	4	So the Greek guy in the article is a shop owner (bike repair).  Just out of curiosity it would be interesting to ask him how many jobs he did last month and how many bills he actually rung.
1	4	I love articles like that.  especially since they are so wrong, but then again it's Der Spiegel, what did i expect.  Spanish and Greek youths are protesting (for obvious reasons, although i think they both are acting entitled) that's hardly millions across Europe.
-	-	Turns out the sixties idea of Europe as a giant commune where everybody, like, just loves each other and we just share everything *maaaaaan* doesn't work. I'll be damned.  Especially since all the other artificial mammoth states based on cultural marxism that completely ignored their nations' genetic and cultural differences did *so well*!
1	6	lol who would have ever imagined a big conglomerate of lazy, ungrateful, effeminate, hopelessly government dependent, business hating socialist parasites would eventually have financial problems?  All we need to do is get a Wal Mart over there and then we will own your worthless asses.
-	-	&gt;Creating disincentives for another large scale conflict on the continent is the single greatest achievement of the economic union.  The EU has nothing whatever to do with peace in Europe after 1945 - unlike the threat of nuclear war in a world divided into two hostile camps.  As for the EU's greatest achievements:   - spending fully half of its budget (more in the past) on the subsidizing of agriculture - for decades!   - keeping European consumer prices high, and Third-World countries poor, through unabashed protectionism.      
-	-	I was tipped off by the phrase "the common currency in a shambles".  Apparently losing a few percent over the past couple months after years of solid growth is considered "in a shambles" to him.  If you would like to see the clearly non-shambles condition of the Euro, [here's a graph](http://www.ecb.int/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/eurofxref-graph-gbp.en.html).  Click the blue "10y" at the top and then click the currencies on the right for a comparison to each one.
1	8	The younger generations don't remember a war-torn Europe. Creating disincentives for another large scale conflict on the continent is the single greatest achievement of the economic union.
1	6	Oh no! We don't want to work with a system that can potentially bring a huge amount of wealth and peace to us- so instead we are going to reminisce about the good ole' days when we were our own countries! We totally lived peacefully, and thrived economically then. Its definitely not our own inability to get along with people who come from countries we hate for reasons we no longer understand.
1	6	&gt; A lot would be achieved if politicians weren't serving the business lobbyists and special interests, but the people instead  I always wonder if this is actually true. Are businesses getting rich by causing/allowing crises like these to happen? Or are the youth just looking for someone to blame?
-	-	It's his father's, he works there.  Technically he's not the owner but that is splitting hairs since it's the family business.  Anyway, since he can afford the luxuries the author mentions (american sneakers, smokes, a car) I was hoping his shop does things by the book.
-	-	&gt;all.  - Did it prevent member states France and the Netherlands from fighting wars, with huge losses, in Indochina, Indonesia, Algeria, and Egypt?    - Did it do anything to deter the actual threat, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact states?  &gt;The coal+steel union wasn't founded to prevent any imminent war, but to make it forever impossible.   This sentence is self-contradictory and historically contra-factual.  Which means it is in keeping with the then officially stated aims of the [European Coal and Steel Community](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community):  &gt; It would encourage world peace  Obviously not.  &gt;It would create the world's first international anti-cartel agency  It created the world's largest example of protectionism and discriminatory market access.  &gt;It would improve the world economy and the developing countries, such as Africa  Third-World and emerging-market countries are actively discriminated against and economically harmed by the EU.    Proof available from the WHO, Oxfam, and other NGOs.  The true reason for the establishment of the ECSC was to let France permanently exploit the coal mines and steel industry of Germany, after previously failed attempts at annexing the Rhineland, or controlling its economy.   The [German version of the Wiki article on the ECSC](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europäische_Gemeinschaft_für_Kohle_und_Stahl) admits that much.
1	6	You mean the easy mechanism. The obvious mechanism is for them to cut their public sector and increase emigration to other parts of the union. I think that the currency devaluation method is the easy way out. 
-	-	I agree. Angie Merkel isn't the one who spent them into oblivion. The Germans didn't cause their current problem. They are the one's leading the push to bail them out, and want strict terms and the Greeks are whinging like there's no tomorrow. 
-	-	But you are losing a "million jobs" by being deliberately inefficent through the Euro - that is, getting less for your exports than they are worth - and pouring out money and hoping for the best.   IF Germany went back to the DM, its productivity woudl have to rise if it wanted to keep all of its markets. However, it would earn much more from those which it kept. On economci balance, it would probably do better to leave. On political balance, it would have to decide what it wanted from life: cosy solidarity or independence. So much of the last 65 years of German policy has been set by the events leading up to 1945 - here is your brand new national identity as the European paymaster and general nice guy. But which is best suited to cope with an expansive Asia: Germany in Europe or Germany fighting its own corner? :)
1	6	Why was the Euro ever introduced in the first place?   There was no lack of warnings by [competent economists about its dangers](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/magazine/16Europe-t.html)   &gt;We basically expanded our economic terrority. No Eurozone = less exports.  Germany has been consistently among the leading exporters on the world market since at least the 1970s.   So it obviously doesn't take the Euro.  &gt;We don't get more out of the EU than we pay into it but we get more out of the countries, corporations and citizens of the EU than we pay into the EU.  See above - Germany did very well with the Mark in the past.   &gt;If we lose that we would lose millions of jobs.  The Euro has done nothing to stop the loss of jobs that has been going on in Germany since the reunification. Nor the stagnation of real wages and salaries.    &gt;The value of the D-Mark would skyrocket, therefore exports would get more expensive.  And the price of your imports would fall accordingly.   Hasn't Germany been much criticized in the current Eurozone crisis for its export-biased balance of trade, and to told buy more from other countries ...?
1	6	&gt;In real value Germany paid more but not nominally.  As real value represents the actual worth of money more accurately, does this mean you *concede* the point?    It deserves pointing out that the victors of Versailles demanded payment of those 269 billion in [Goldmarks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_gold_mark), a currency based on gold and silver: 1 Goldmark = 0.35842 grammes of gold, or 5.555 grammes of silver.  Besides, German payments to the EU have continued since 1994.   I would also like to ask what source your updated figures are from?
0	2	woops
0	1	&gt; Yes it has, because subsidies based on crop acreage and number of stock will inevitably benefit larger farms more than smaller ones.  We're discussing the idea of subsidization, but you've just pointed out an implementation detail...  Furthermore, doesn't the quote from the wikileak actually support the opposite? 300,000 Euro is small.  That aside, I reiterate: local industrial agriculture is better than no agriculture at all.  &gt; According to a reliable source who wanted to remain anonymous, there is allegedly a compromise on the ceiling of individual farmers earning more than 300,000 Euro where the beneficiary stands to lose 70 percent of the subsidies while those earning lower amounts will lose far less.  That isn't ideal, but if you're proposing that the EU remove subsidies as a result, I vehemently disagree. Baby and bathwater, perfect is the enemy of good, etc.
-	-	The easy way is usually the right way. Yes they need to cut their public sector. However they could do it much more gradually with control of monetary policy.
-	-	&gt;The Euro has done nothing to stop the loss of jobs that has been going on in Germany since the reunification. Nor the stagnation of real wages and salaries.  I think you're getting this wrong.  We lost jobs in the nineties not only because of the reunification itself but because of the ongoing upvaluation of the D-Mark during the early nineties when the European monetary system was getting into trouble. Imagine what would have happened in 2009 when everybody wanted a good reserve currency and we'd still have the D-Mark. Without the Euro we couldn't have managed the two crises that happened after the banking industry got completely deregulated. So here the Euro did save jobs!  Of course, the Euro alone didn't bring jobs BACK to Germany (see early 2000's) but in combination with the reforms of the late SPD/Grüne coalition and the ongoing wage restraint in Germany it certainly did. We were able to get our competiveness back because we had no wage increases like other big European countries in the Eurozone. And so we were able to produce cheaper goods and everyone buys them. Without the Euro especially the southern European countries could have devalued their currencies to stop that but they can't do that anymore so they are forced to buy our shit (see: Greece).  It's not nice but we are basically making the rest of Europe our bitch to bring down our unemployment rate and even more to get the GDP up.  So Euro + wage restraint certainly did bring jobs back in the last 5 years.  See here: http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=z9a8a3sje0h8ii_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=eu_country:DE&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=germany+unemployment  The graph goes down right after the "Agenda 2010" is finalized.  &gt;Hasn't Germany been much criticized in the current Eurozone crisis for its export-biased balance of trade, and to told buy more from other countries ...?  The criticism isn't that we export more than we import but that we produce more stuff for other countries than for ourselves. The thing is: this cannot change. Remember, we are keeping the wages flat, so there is simply no money to buy more cars and whatnot for ourselves. Without wage increases we can't raise domestic consumption but if we increase wages we would lose the competitive edge we have right now to sell all that stuff to other countries.  EDIT: Just to be clear about this - I hate our way of dealing with this and I agree with many people from other European countries that the current way is simply unfair. But if we get rid of all of this we are fucked royally. You can expect unemployment to get to even higher levels than they were in 2005.
-	-	But there's not a single socialist regime in Europe. . 
0	5	Too late. Walmart failed in Germany because the appeal of buying a t-shirt that is 50% cheaper that has to be replaced 50% sooner didn't appeal to the locals. 
-	-	They should be more careful with the people they let in, aka. stop importing muslims.
1	4	Lol, Americans downvoting because they know they are in 20x worse financial status than the EU.
-	-	Er... no.  He's the son of a motorcycle tire shop owner, whose father had to lay off 3 workers, but didn't lay him off... but did reduce his wages.  He seems to be in the best shape of everybody in the article though.  He's got a job that can't be exported, because you can't exactly get motorcycle tires put on in China. 
1	4	The EU exists because, not so long ago, we were going at war with each over every over decade and, after the last one, people thought it would be a good idea to stop doing this.
-	-	I am pretty sure they are yelling into the air for jobs. Now if you actually read TFA...
-	-	I read this as "Kefka" I've been playing way too much Final Fantasy VI.
1	6	It would still be way more democratic than the USA
0	5	The Article is alarmist and misleading. They had a protest in Munich to support the psanish protests this weekend. There were 40 people there. It was pathetic. 
0	2	So, you believe that Germany invests in the European Union out of sympathy for the poorer countries?
1	6	so then...  Germany = The Alberta of the EU   It all makes sense now!
-	-	But that is like 100% cheaper over time! (&lt;-- American thoughts)
-	-	Downvoters, which country do you believe has a socialist regime?
1	4	Thanks. I agree with you as above, and was also surprised by 1971. As ever, this was a political grand project, with its goal being to Be Grand, a flagship, but a flagship without a fleet or sailing directions. One sees similar Duke of York* nonsense in EU policy on the environment (biofuels directive) and the social legislation that it has enacted apparently specifically to raise costs.   (* The Grand Old Duke of York,  He had ten thousand men.  He marched them up to the top of the hill  And he marched them down again.   And when they were up they were up.  And when they were down they were down.  And when they were only half way up  They were neither up nor down.  Old English folk tune on the futility of ill-considered initiatives.) 
-	-	Prices always rise a small amount, ~2% inflation is intended, the point stands, the argument that "the Euro made everything expensive" is wrong.
-	-	Just to set the facts straight in 1921 Germany was demanded for 269 billion marks, equivalent to 785 billion 2011 USD (In 1932 this number was lowered to 20 billion marks or 81 billion 2011 USD). The 163 billion marks paid by Germany to the EU were worth 684 billion USD in 1958. In real value Germany paid more but not nominally.  ninja edit: I'm trying to get as much info on "go ahead and prove that Germany actually gets more out of the EU than it pays into it" so I can make a well researched post. In the meantime [here's an article by the New York Times on why Germany has been the biggest beneficiary of the Euro](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/business/global/23charts.html?_r=1&amp;smid=tw-nytimesbusiness&amp;seid=auto).
-	-	If the Euro fails and we would go back to the D-Mark, everyone around the globe would buy up said D-Marks because it would be a very stable currency. The value of the D-Mark would skyrocket, therefore exports would get more expensive.   Also, we benefit greatly from the Eurozone to sell all that stuff we produce, I think the biggest reason we agreed to found the Euro was because we needed to sell more stuff. We basically expanded our economic terrority. No Eurozone = less exports.  We don't get more out of the EU than we pay into it but we get more out of the countries, corporations and citizens of the EU than we pay into the EU.  If we lose that we would lose millions of jobs.
1	8	I don't think this is proof that the world is overpopulated, this is just a severe economic downturn in the global economy.  It's also the result of a more globalized world where many jobs can be done more cheaply elsewhere.  Having said that, I do think the world is overpopulated, and would like to see the population a lot lower than it currently is. 
0	2	It's not the normal networking that bothers me, it's the opening of a position in public contest for a specific person kind of networking.  In Socialist Portugal you open the positions, if well connected.  I am not that kind of person. I am a regular voter, I am an active member of one of the top 3 parties in Portugal. But that does not stops me from seeing and writing about what's wrong.  I believe in honest hard work and I see many talents being wasted because lack of connections. Why should the son of our ex-president get a top executive job in one of our largest corp at 23 y/o fresh out of the university? It was hes first job! I'm sure there were people much more experienced and qualified that were left behind because they didn't had the right connections.  edit: typo
1	8	Or #4: sigh and accept. 
0	2	Truly, why not? Might as well because this idea is as absurd as the idea that there are not enough jobs to go around. If the elite who horde money actually invest it in growing the economy and creating jobs, we wouldn't have the choice between a shit job or no job.
-	-	&gt;However, that has nothing to do with the idea of subsidization,   Yes it has, because subsidies based on crop acreage and number of stock will inevitably benefit larger farms more than smaller ones.   Not to mention that bigger farmers are better at lobbying.   See e.g. [wikileaked EU documents](http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Leaked_documents_suggest_European_CAP_reform_just_a_whitewash)  &gt;According to a reliable source who wanted to remain anonymous, there is allegedly a compromise on the ceiling of individual farmers earning more than 300,000 Euro where the beneficiary stands to lose 70 percent of the subsidies while those earning lower amounts will lose far less. The earlier proposal was to drastically cut the subsidies to big farms but the pressure from lobby groups seems to have paid off, the source pointed out.
0	1	&gt;What all the voting I did wasn't democratic?  You voted for a parliament that has very few powers, but high salaries, and quite some disreputable members.   &gt;I'm damn certain that the EU has problems, but frankly its better than sheer bitter competition   Wait until Greece has to restructure its debt, and other Eurozone members will have to cover the dozens of billions that have vanished out of their banks balance sheets.    Than you are going to see some sheer bitter competition!  &gt;personally I'd like some form of federalised continental nation  Good luck trying to create policies that will answer the needs of 27 very diverse and heterogeneous nations.  One size fits all?  The Euro monetary policy certainly does not.   &gt;Furthermore I'm utterly aghast at the mess that Greece is in,  And now imagine the politicians responsible for this mess wouldn't need to borrow in the bond market, but had instead the power to transfer the tax money of other nations to themselves  in your pan-European "federalised continental nation".   
0	2	Yeah, thats how I got all my jobs.  Statist morons
-	-	that's [racist](http://i.imgur.com/HuL83.gif) !
1	4	In Munich we are actually doing just fine, thank you. 
-	-	As long as the EU commission, President of the European Council and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy are **not** voted this is not the European Union we want, this is for sure.
-	-	Yes but their entrance to the Euro has robbed them of the obvious mechanism to get out of jail.  It is 100% clear that Greece should not have been allowed into the Euro. It is a nice change from where the EU continually put pressure on non-Euro members to sign up and insisted that all new members would have to join the Euro. Suddenly we are realising that non-Euro membership is not just a political hack made to appease Britain. That non-membership can be the right thing for individual nations and for the union.  This is a wonderful turn of events (not the disaster but the change in tack) and both the Euro and the EU members will be better for it.
0	2	Absolutely, but the Greeks themselves are just being whining little turds (sorry, but it's true) they claim that they didn't do anything wrong but the politicians did it! And now they don't really want to fix the problems other people (in their eyes) created, but they just want to go on strikes and protest all year round.. like that's going to fix their country.  It's frustrating for me as a pro-eu supporter to see how a country that has fucked up is almost gleefully trying to get itself either expelled from the Euro (And that would be a bad thing considering there are other nonimees that might have to get booted after) or trying to go bankrupt (and how that'd help the Greek is beyond me)  I'm not saying we should support hem indefinitely, but come on guys, yeah you got screwed, but this isn't helping the rest of us that are trying to help you win over the doubters.. 
-	-	&gt;... but to say that Germany doesn't benefit from the EU is demonstrably wrong.  I dare you - go ahead and prove that Germany actually gets more out of the EU than it pays into it:   *Niall Ferguson, 'The Cash Fountains of Versailles', The Spectator, August 14, 1993, pp. 14--16.*   &gt;Between 1958 and 1994 Germany paid 163 billion marks to the rest of Europe in form of net contributions to the European Economic Community/European Union budget:    &gt;more (in nominal terms) than the total amount of reparations demanded at London in 1921.
0	1	You're absolutely right.  And, IIRC, Germany has a fairly robust federal system to deal with just that issue.  The larger the scale of a political institution, the more narrowly its powers must be defined.  But the EU doesn't seem to understand this, and acts like it's governing a municipality, a region, a nation-state, and an international organization all at once.  That doesn't work, and leads to the exact sort of problems that are now occurring.
1	6	What about this for an idea that will probably get shot down in flames: we keep the Euro for international trade, business, finance and so on; but allow individual nations to issue their own supplementary currencies for personal use? They could be backed against gold/ cheese/ wine reserves (or the Euro itself!) and might allow for two things:   1. the prospect of not having mountains of debt being defaulted on by the wholesale abandonment of the Euro along with all the messy associated consequences of that.   2. an organic decoupling of the real economy from the domain of speculative finance and stampeding herds of investors. 
1	4	Thanks for setting me straight. I had no idea the euro was introduced in 1971, nor did I realise that those Bundesbank sourced statistics you quote are relevant to the cost of small ticket items the common individual spends his/her disposable income on - prices of which rose consistently across the Eurozone.   The whole goddamn point of the Euro was to provide a unified command and control mechanism intended to provide economic stability and normalise costs across the zone- raising prices in poor countries to the level of the richer nations while hoping and relying upon some mythical process through which the Italians would get organised, the Spanish productive, the Greeks start paying taxes, the Irish to stop gerrymandering and the Germans to develop a sense of humour. I won't mention the French. And so on.   Quite naturally, if I give you my car keys and *you are already drunk*, following which I get in the car with you and encourage you to put your foot on the accelerator before even a single driving lesson... ok, screw the analogy... *and have spent 100* of the last 150 years in default;  then I certainly bear a significant measure of responsibility the crash that probabilistically occurs.   OliverSparrow provides an excellent macroeconomic summary.
0	2	&gt; So tell me why the number of family-owned farms, who are allegedly to benefit from all this money, has been dropping for years, whereas industrial agriculture has been on the rise?  Indeed, that is a problem, because industrial agriculture is high intensity and thus much more fragile to shocks (e.g. oil price). However, that has nothing to do with the idea of subsidization, but rather its implementation.  That said, local industrial agriculture is better than no agriculture at all.  I will also point out that you can lead a horse to water, but cannot make it drink -- there is a general attitude among the young generation that food production work is low prestige, even though it's the foundation of civilization, so few want anything to do with it.  &gt; The average income of your farmers has not been improved that much either.  Without subsidies they may have been the opposite of improved. More data needed to support small EU farmers would be better without subsidies.  &gt; And food prices in the EU were not spared from the effects of the 2007–2008 world food price crisis, were they?  First, EU may not produce enough food for its population, so it'd still be vulnerable to external prices even if its local food were no longer part of those markets -- but the vulnerability is reduced. Second, there's nothing wrong with price fluctuations so long as there isn't an emergency; once there is an emergency, you can legislate all food production be rerouted to local use.
0	2	&gt; To repeat it: what nation within that union was supposed to have been a threat to peace?  *all*.  &gt; Germany was  See, and there's your misunderstanding. The coal+steel union wasn't founded to prevent any imminent war, but to make it *forever impossible*. The US got a federal army (which is unthinkable in Europe) as Europe has a highly integrated and interdependent steel industry, both for exactly the same reason.

0	1	What all the voting I did wasn't democratic? Granted I got some right wing nationalists representing my country for my efforts, but I disagree there.   I'm damn certain that the EU has problems, but frankly its better than sheer bitter competition and if we can grow further together, personally I'd like some form of federalised continental nation to grow out of it, then I think it would be good.   Furthermore I'm utterly aghast at the mess that Greece is in, I know that equally while Britain is avoiding helping them benefits us I'm appalled that we're not.
1	4	Krugman is right, we are entering a new economic dark ages.  If there are thousands of jobs vacancies and only a handful of people looking for a job, then you can blame the unemployed for not attaining the right skills to fill in one of those vacancies.  When there are millions of unemployed and no job vacancies, then you blame the government and monetary authorities.  This is not some weird fringe economic theory. It's the mainstream analysis of the great depression on which both Keynes and Milton Friedman built their whole careers.  Ask any competent macroeconomist and he'll give you this correct diagnosis.

0	1	I don't think you understand anything about this. The young generation doesn't ask to dismantle the European Union (like their parents), but ask instead what is their future while their countries are on the brink of defaulting and they will have to pay the bill (for their parents and grand parents mistakes).   Now shut the fuck up.
0	2	Yeah Germany would be so much worse off without having to support all of the countries that are failing...
0	1	There's a huge fucking difference between the cuddly, pan-European, post-nationalist desire for a supranational entity built on commonalities of shared histories, cohesive diversity and open borders... and the fundamentally opaque, antidemocratic and parasitical, absurdly inefficient bureaucracy that passes the laws.  I believe the growing protests will ultimately result in close scrutiny to fundamental structural issues that have been swept under the rug and ignored by most except for marginalised fringe movements for far too long.   Some of these issues are:   1. The Euro: was designed to simplify trade and unify productivity. Has so far ended up in making everything more expensive for consumers; fueling rampant speculative bubbles in banking and property due to cheap credit and lack of breaks once provided by currency exchanges; letting bankingscum seduced Greek governments (along with the Irish, Spanish.. and well, all of them to a certain degree) get away with economic foolishness while believing themselves safe in the insecure knowledge that the safety net of the ECB would always have their backs.   2. The lack of transparent democratic process inherent in the bastard (technical use, not pejorative) institutions the political project of the EU has begotten. i.e. Length of US constitution: 12 pages of inspiring prose. Length of EU constitution:  300 pages of legalese, plus numerous appendices and fuck all public debate on the contents.   3. Demographic challenges. Basically, old Europe hasn't been having enough babies - the traditional population pyramid is becoming inexorably inverted - leaving us with only a decade or two before there are more people over 50 than under it. Que massive pension shortfalls and the realisation that no social welfare system in its currently systematized operation can survived when more people are drawing from it than are contributing from it.   So the original plan was to unify currencies, standardise goods and services across the Union, increase migration; as well as filling the chronic labour shortage by importing workers from the wider world.   But... unfuckingfortunately, it turns out that there may be one or two problems developing. And the feedback loops are resulting in poverty-rooted intercultural, interclass discord and ghettoisation, erosion of European national identities - the far right have always profited from tidal upswells in poverty despair and if we don't tackle the very real problem: cultural, economic and political - in a mature and responsible way, they'll goosestep with glee and may soon even start to win national elections. Then we'll all really be fucked. But, at least the trains might run on time again.  TL/DR: The protesters have got a point and their leaders should listen to the rationality of their concerns lest we end up tearing Europe apart. *Live together, die alone* and all that.

1	8	&gt;We don't want to work with a system that can potentially bring a huge amount of wealth   To politicians, bureaucrats, and corporations, not to the people.  &gt;We totally lived peacefully,  The EU's attempt at peacekeeping in ex-Yugoslavia proved that they cannot get anything done without the US. The current campaign in Libya confirms this. It was the bi-polar power status of the Cold War that brought peace to Europe, not the EU.  &gt;Its definitely not our own inability to get along with people who come from countries we hate for reasons we no longer understand.  Painting the unemployed and excluded as right-wing morons only shows that no rational arguments are left for the continued existence of this European Union.   As one commentator put it aptly:    "*The EU is a 1950s answer to the problems of the 1930s*".  In terms of preparing Europe for the challenges of the future, it is a total failure.    Proof: compare the presence with the goals stated in the [Lisbon Strategy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon_agenda).   *'Its aim was to make the EU "the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion", by 2010.*'   What a sorry joke.
1	6	Or perhaps it's be something more like this:  &gt; Oh no!  We don't want to be shoehorned into a uniform bureaucratic system that encourages conflict and creates stagnation by attempting to create one-size-fits-all policies for countries that are vastly different culturally and economically!  We know from history what kind of bad things can happen from creating centralized, unaccountable authority in Europe.   
1	6	Sure, at the same time the implementation is highly anti-democratic.   The European executive power is embodied by the European Commission and the European Council. They basically appoint each other with the help of some corrupt politicians of the particular countries.   The Parliament is the only body under direct democratic influence and all it can do is veto the entire body of appointees. While having legislative power it cannot even do any legislative initiative without the Commission.  In short, too much power for an unchecked body of politicians. When was that ever a recipe for success. This usually runs well initially and quickly turns into corruption-driven plutocratic regimes. 
0	2	Rubbish. There are advantages to the US system. Things I miss. That said there are great things abluot Europe. A hybrid would better than either by itself.

0	2	&gt; spending fully half of its budget (more in the past) on the subsidizing of agriculture - for decades!  This is a problem because...?  Air, water, food, shelter, security are necessities, in that order. If you're not protecting your local food production, you're a bloody idiot (to put it mildly).
-	-	The EU grew out of a coal and steel union, which very much disincentivized war developments. 
0	2	Ironically, it's the very strength of the Euro that's causing problems for Greece.  Greece should never have been allowed into the Euro to start with - they basically lied about their finances to get in, and as a result they're stuck with a relatively strong currency at a time when they should be devaluing.  
-	-	Currency strength doesn't really say anything about the viability of a currency block.
-	-	I agree with much of what you say about the EU, which started as the civil version of NATO - in order "to control the spread of communism" - and has become whatever any one nation wants to believe it to be. Amorphous, therefore, and without a clear goal.   That said, there exist two socioeconomic dynamics which produce contradictory political repsonses. These are by no means restricted to the EU. One of these is the urge to geographical solidarity, and the other is international competition.   The "solidarity" issue holds that everyone who is a citizen of a given country is to be supported by everyone else in the style that they have learned to enjoy. Well, fine; that is a choice, an expensive choice, but one that gains votes. However, it is in direct contradiction to the issues raised by international competition.   Low skill individuals - unless supported by high capital investment, in the shape of e.g. automation - are often unable to compete with low wage, high skill areas. In a purely economic world, their wages would be expected to fall until they could compete: that is, to roughly the same wages as are paid in Asia or wherever it is that is in competition with them. British farm wages collapsed in the 1870s, for example, when new shipping and farming technologies brought in produce from the US, Canada and Australia.  The national economy will always perform better if low cost goods and labour are allowed into it. However, low skill workers will tend to see their wages fall as a result of this. For example, the influx of low wage workers from New Europe into the countries of Old Europe has brought down artisan wages by a large factor: by more than half in London, for example. An electrician previously charging £200 a day will now get £70-90 per day. That is excellent for the customer and the economy, but not good for the British electrician. The same is true where the embodied value can be shipped around, for example, as engine parts or integrated circuits.   This provokes two contradictory responses in politics. One says: increase skills and capabilities, compete directly. US productivity was such that Mexico lost jobs when NAFTA was formed. German productivity allowed its wages to be double that of Spain, and it was Spain that lost the jobs.   The other political response is to protect "our" people with tariffs, quotas; by subsidising firms to employ staff at higher wages than they would otherise get - in agriculture, for example - and by creating state sector non-jobs to keep people busy. The North West of England has about 65% of its economy and 85% of its employment directly sponsored by the state. This is voter-friendly, but ultimately ruinous, as we have seen.   The Euro was a particularly damaging institution for inefficient countries. If you can devalue your currency, you can probably continue indefinately with low efficiency and static wages. If you pin your currency, then all that is open to you by way of adjustment is either to cause wages to fall, usually through high unemployment, or to borrow to make up the difference. Spain's unemployment had to rise to 25% in order to force wages low enough so that it could maintain its external balance. Other Mediterranean states simply borrowed and hoped that the problem would occur on someone else's watch. The banking crisis brought this to a head. Very much the same dynamics were evident in the US after the dollar was universally adopted. Unemployement soared and wages fell in states like Kentucky and Tennessee, whilst those in the North-East rose.  What is to be done? Well, the cost of keeping the maflunctioning states in the Euro until they gain the required competitiveness is going to be vast. The political cost of pushing them out of the Euro is also vast, but probably more acceptable to the average citizen of the potential supporter nations in the Eurozone, such as Germany. An acceptable fudge might be a two speed Euro: the real thing, and a training wheels version in which central bank and fiscal policy was tightly restricted and the "local Euro" allowed to devalue until it hit equilibrium. This conveys no economic advantages whatsoever, but saves political face. 
1	4	Right on. I would like a unified Europe. But not anything akin to what the EU is delivering. It needs to be taken out of the hands of corrupt bureaucrats and lifetime politicians and put into the hands of visionary leaders, but the world has a massive short fall of non-media preening political leadership.
1	4	For laughing out loud, DrRichardCranium keeps pumping out these articles of how the sky is going to fall in the EU, but miraculously it really hasn't.
-	-	Portugal here. One thing I can say for sure, the main problem are corrupt politicians that serve the bankers/big corp and not the people.  In Portugal, banks pay less than half the normal tax rate, our biggest telco pays no taxes at all. Our biggest corps are know as "politician parks", its where they came from or go after serving their terms.  Fuel, electricity and gas is a cartel market.  Skills here means nothing, connections is everything. If you know the right people you have a job, if you don't, you're fucked.  Those are our main problems and we need a big change.
-	-	The problems in Greece might also have something to do with the Greeks themselves. The corruption of the economic and political system was in place long before the common currency.
0	2	To repeat it: what nation within that union was supposed to have been a threat to peace?  Germany was occupied, divided, overrun with refugees, paying reparations, and bombed to pieces.  It neither could, nor wanted to, wage war again for the foreseeable future.  The danger of war after 1945 came from the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact organization, against which the EC/EU had to rely on NATO.  Following the end of the Cold War, the EU promptly showed its helplessness at peacekeeping in the Yugoslav civil wars.   Boast about the EU as a *"guarantor of peace"* all you like, the claim does not stand up to scrutiny.

0	1	&gt;If you're not protecting your local food production, you're a bloody idiot (to put it mildly).  True, and as oil (and therefore transportation) prices increase and the odd food shortage/panic pops up, I suspect this will kill 'free' trade as we know it now. 
-	-	&gt;Firstly, the EU was vital in keeping peace in Western Europe since 1945.  Sheer, counter-factual propaganda.  The EU in its very earliest form didn't even exist until the Treaties of Rome, signed in March 1957.   Who kept the peace from 1945 to 1957?   Don't tell me it was the *European Coal and Steel Community*, founded to keep Germany in check, and subordinated to French and Benelux economic interests.  Because it was hardly German, occupied, weakened, and divided, that was threatening peace in Europe during the Cold War, was it?   &gt;I can understand Europeans being EU sceptic, but Americans? It's a strange world.  Frankly, I cannot understand why you Europeans put up with this wasteful, protectionist, un-democratic nightmare. From spying on your emails to ramping up the costs of driver licenses, the EU is making your life worse, not better.     The free movement of goods, services and people is beneficial, the rest is clearly not. The Eurozone with its harmful "one-size-fits-none" monetary policy is the latest example. Time to start from scratch.
0	1	&gt;If you're not protecting your local food production,  So tell me why the number of family-owned farms, who are allegedly to benefit from all this money, has been dropping for years, whereas industrial agriculture has been on the rise?  The average income of your farmers has not been improved that much either. And food prices in the EU were not spared from the effects of the 2007–2008 world food price crisis, were they?  &gt;you're a bloody idiot (to put it mildly).  Look in a mirror, sport. 
-	-	It is a problem because it represents a net transfer of money from one part of the union to another. CAP is not about protecting agriculture. It is about getting the north of the union to give shed loads of money to the south.  If we said "keep CAP as it is but nations are required to pay proportional to how much they use it" then support for CAP would vanish overnight. In fact CAP is being reigned in because the British rebate means that France suddenly pays a lot of money to keep CAP around.

-	-	&gt; Gil applied for many jobs after receiving her university degree, including positions in France, Spain and Great Britain. She says she would even go to Angola, a former Portuguese colony. At the same time, she finds it absurd that the only way to succeed is to look for work outside Portugal. "You can't expect an entire generation to emigrate. The country has invested a lot in education, and we are better educated than any generation before us. And then they send us away? Is this Europe?" Gil asks.  This is the ultimate outcome of social-democracy. Highly educated, very healthy emigrants.

0	2	The article does much to talk about where people are today (screwed and frustrated) and some to talk about how they got there (corrupt politicans working with corrupt banks) and surprisingly little about possible solutions.  Rearranging debts is not going to help anymore.  Ultimately there is going to have to be a lot of debt forgiveness, or else nations are going to have to go bankrupt and start over.  The only way this won't happen again in the future, is if the corrupt banking industry and corrupt politicians are regulated and monitored properly in the future.

1	6	Well, there is a pointer to a very new world. As the bigger systems get more integrated, subsidiarity really works and Aberdeen focuses just on off shore engineering, Delft just on education around engineering and geology. Here a retirement district, there a region specialising in elecronics start ups. Lots of economic logic to this, and a great deal of evidence that it is how clusters of ability function at their best.   But then we look across at Liverpool, or the abandoned centres of old industry across Europe, and wonder who and what concentrates in those? Well, you see run down districts in cities: would they be any different? Is this not what house prices and rents do to populations anyway?   If we go that way, it will be the end of the nation state. One sees, instead, a set of levels at which administration, economic oversight and so on are handled, and a maze of microscopic, largely self-governing enities clustered around their particular specialisation.

1	6	(Some) youth are looking for someone to blame. Commerce gets unreasonably rich when what are called "alienable rents" ar ecreated - monopolies, narrow information bases, protectionism. All of that gets bundled as "mercantalism". Argentina under Peron, or Germany under Hilter were good examples of this. Wages were forced down, and anly a few firms were allowed to operate - through, for example, export or production licenses - leading to a sittuation with with minimal competition.   What you have in Europe is almost teh exact opposite of this: wages held up, firms prevented from making their workforce fully productive, a host of regulations and a sprawling state. The consequence is sluggish activity and, where this fungus has been allowed to grow without check, crisis as the floor boards give way. Activists love a clear target, a class enemy; but alas for them, "we have met the enemy, and the enemy is us". 
0	2	&gt; One thing I can say for sure, the main problem are corrupt politicians that serve the bankers/big corp and not the people.  Welcome to the world.

1	6	Young Europeans don't see how the EU helps them? Surely the author has heard of the ERASMUS programme.
0	3	It seems like a lot of people without jobs aren't happy and have time on their hands.  They want an income, but don't fundamentally have any idea what changes they would actually want to make to get there.  Many of them also seem to have chosen studies that have only vague job prospects:  Sagarra: Physicist   Gil: International Relations   Boyer: Engineer, worked as a technical sales consultant but "felt a deep sense of unease about the world"   Dekoumes: works for his father who has a shop selling motorcycle tires   Karl: "stacks beverage cases by day", but went to school for sociology and political science  When the economy's booming, or at least growing quickly, you can often study whatever you find interesting, and eventually you'll find someone who's willing to pay you to work.  When the economy shrinks, if you didn't choose a career that's in demand, it will be hard to find work.  It's a hard lesson to learn, and with decades of economic growth, one that seems to have been forgotten, but it's true.  The problem isn't "Europe" or "Angela Merkel" or "bankers".  It's just the way things are.  If your skills aren't in high demand, you won't always be able to find a job.

0	2	Bullshit.  It didn't get more [expensive](http://www.bundesbank.de/10jahreeuro/images/grafik1_2.en.png).  Speculative bubbles in property and banking only happened in some Euro countries and absolutely not in others, those were completely dependent on the policies of the respective country and not the EU.  Those poor unaccountable governments who "got away" with their economic foolishness, if only someone could have stopped them. Clearly if I give you my car and you get drunk and crash it taking out a whole lot of inoccent bystanders, it is my fault for giving you the car.  The US constitution has not the scope the EU constitution would have had, it stems from a whole different legal history.  The population growth is not uniform [across Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Demographics_of_Europe.svg), while some countries have a (big) problem it is nothing unmanageable.  
1	8	You can blame the government and the banks for the bursting of the economic bubble, but what the government has done since has been positive, just not enough.  Last I read, Krugman was saying that the second great depression had been avoided, but that we were in for a very long period of "jobless recovery".  But, my point was more that for a very long time people have been able to study whatever they felt was interesting without regard for how useful it was in finding a job, and now that the economy isn't nearly as strong as it was, that's coming back to bite them.  The severity of the economic downturn means that even people who had good job prospects are now hurting, but the ones who are the worst off are the ones who studied pretty impractical things.  I see the benefit of learning for the sake of learning, but, at the same time, I hope the long-term result of this is that more people take a more pragmatic approach at choosing what they're going to study so that when there are the future inevitable economic downturns, they are more secure. 
1	4	Yeah, he and the guy selling motorcycle tires have chosen education / training with good job prospects.  Engineers seem to stay in demand, and it's not possible to outsource things like working on motorcycles, so there will always be some local demand there.  The rest of them, however... 
0	2	&gt;It's not about Europe vs the US vs China anymore, it's about a money-based system that is inherently broken and makes no sense vs a reason and resource-based one.

What the hell is up with that?  If we're at our technological peak, how can you suggest that humanity changes to a system that relies on technology that doesn't exist?    &gt;How anyone can argue that a money- and profit-based system works with that fact and all these other facts lined up to boot is completely beyond me.  Because it works better than any other system.  &gt;The Venus Project and the Zeitgeist Movement.  Are repackaged communism.    Given that every attempt to implement it at a national level resulted in economic disaster, where millions died in large nations, how can you seriously recommend them?

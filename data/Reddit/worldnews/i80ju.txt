0	1	So you're mad that Iran Air can't purchase American made aircraft parts to fix their dilapidated fleet, yet you want to U.S. to "fuck off". Can't have it both ways. Iran Air sure doesn't want the U.S. to "fuck off", that's for sure.  (My comment was mostly in jest. I'm fully aware that you have no idea what sanctions are.)

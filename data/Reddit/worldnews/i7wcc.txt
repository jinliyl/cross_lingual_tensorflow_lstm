0	1	Mswati III  can do what he wants and I doubt any article is going to change that.   True story: he once wanted to 'buy' my mother who was already married to my father for three cows when we lived there for three years... Fucking Swahili polygamists!

1	6	&gt; in Swaziland, where Coca-Cola contributes over 40 per cent of the countryâ€™s gross domestic product.  that's just crazy!

This stuck out in particular:   "Coca-Cola and its affiliates have also been accused of abusing "countless fundamental human rights", according to a HRCI research report, such as anti-union violence, discriminatory practises and union busting."  For the American redditors, we should take note. This is happening in countless states, most recently my home state of NJ. Join the protests to the threat of unions. The quality of life in America would be nothing like it is now if not for organized labor.

1	6	I think the real problem is being glossed over. The article mentioned that getting an executive hooked up with an iPad can quickly turn into a pilot to get Sales on iPads. To me, that tells me that companies are broken far more deeply than the article otherwise suggests. Why would the executive be exempt from the rules and policies he or she signed off on? If the executive has helped shape--or even just signed off on--the policies that control how new technology is introduced, then they should be following those policies. If the CEOs want iPads, let them sponsor and champion projects to that end rather than dictating a break from policy that forces unprepared systems to simply absorb them.

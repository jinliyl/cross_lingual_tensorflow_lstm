1	6	&gt; [The wife] put it in the glove compartment of [her and her husband's] jointly-owned GMC Yukon.  I don't understand why this is news. She was the (joint) owner of the car. That's what this whole case relied on.

0	1	Damn it came here to say same thing.  She is tracking her car, he is free to preserve his privacy but can not have an expectation of one in a jointly owned car.  So long as he knows it's jointly owned of course.
0	2	So it's also OK to tap the jointly owned phone, install a spycam in the jointly owned bedroom, etc?

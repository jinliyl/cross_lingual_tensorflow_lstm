0	1	Fire up the party van, Bob...
1	4	I wish people could try to read sites like this more objectively and critically. I fully support net neutrality and 100% privacy and anonymity, but stooping to lying and manipulation of the facts is only going to hurt the cause. If your side lack credibility, it makes it that much more difficult to make your point.
-	-	Yeah, I guess I really crossed the line by being critical of such a highly regarded news source.
-	-	Thanks phunphun :) Just wanted to make clear that since my comment is hilarious and has been posted on reddit, we can assure, without any room for doubt, that all comments on reddit are hilarious. 
-	-	This. Also, people, please don't google child porn as this article basically suggested...
-	-	He meant after tax. 
0	2	and thus stoop to the level of every propaganda machine, ever.  I'm not going to debate the morality or utility of your stance. I just wish there was a better way to get people to realize that perhaps they should become educated about some of this shit.
1	4	I completely agree with anything and everything, everywhere.
0	6	Walking around naked is a lot more fun?
1	4	We are using Tor to bypass the government censorship in Iran. Happy now?
-	-	According to your theory then, without copyright there would be no music or movies. Just because lawyers want to game the legal system and make a career of it, does not make copyright an industry. It's a tool, nothing more, nothing less.
1	6	I wonder if this approach is beginning in Canada, due to the recent Prime Time TV commercial spots talking about stopping child pornography... hmmm.
0	1	where the hell are the pubescent corporation's picture of getting it violated by society? because i definitely want those pictures.
-	-	Give the government an inch, they'll take the mile over the course of years.
1	6	My Lady Gaga mp3's are like naked children? I'm confused by the ridiculousness of the assertion.
-	-	The only thing that cannot be found on the Internet.
0	2	to some, every photo of a child ever taken, is child pornography...
1	2	Who doesn't?
0	1	Awful defensive when we mention those aren't you? Got something to hide there mister child pornographer dude?
0	2	First they came for the perverts...
0	2	Say we need to crackdown on "CP file sharing"; sue kids for downloading Justin Beiber. More hypocritical bullshit from IP whores.
-	-	And any Disney thing from the 90's onward.
0	5	&gt;Try Googling for the Swedish word for child pornography      um, no.
-	-	*“We pointed out to [the governor] that there are overlaps between the child porn problem and piracy,” Mr. Sherman [The RIAA president] said, “because all kinds of files, legal and otherwise, are traded on peer-to-peer networks.”*  There is no better illustration of the patronization of security over freedom. We can have neither anonymity nor privacy, for both are presented as weapons for the subversion of order. Why would you want to be anonymous? Only a child pornographer would want that.   It is incredible how easily freedom is compromised. Look at this, *one* topic of censor - child pornography - and it spreads and spreads like some kind of invasive vine. It becomes the flag under which all other censorship sails, including entire sites, domain names, seizure of servers and the arrest of individuals (including *extradition to be tried in the US*). All that from allowing one damn thing to be censored.  I swear, you can't trust these people with anything.  EDIT: Included quote.
-	-	10 bucks this Johan Schlüter got gigabytes of child pornography on his hard drive.
-	-	Or the "elite" may get it, and decide that they need to hog it for themselves to ensure that humanity moves in the right direction under their "benevolent" overwatch...
-	-	You may be interested to know that, using my "Find" feature and searching the original article posted, the word "censor" was found over 100 times.  Of course this also included the "comments" section.  The word was used about 8 times in the original posted link.
0	2	Well, that was extremely well thought out.  &gt;In my opinion, intellectual property is a completely broken system. It worked before we had systems that could copy and distribute data in microseconds, when we had to physically press vinyl records, produce film rolls, and use printing presses to distribute books. The digital world of the last thirty years has put an end to this line of thinking, and our laws simply don't work with it.  That is entirely true. 
0	8	You have a weak password
1	4	That site. I have never swung so violently and repetitively between raging and laughing.
0	2	I hate that site, not because it is bad but because it makes me hate people so much. It hurts me every time I look at it.
0	2	Send it to the onion.

0	2	The full argument was [linked to](http://mogis-verein.de/eu/en/) but the tl;dr version is that blocking child pornography doesn't make it go away, it just hides it, and that "Crimes should be punished and not hidden".  By blocking child pornography instead of removing it, you're ignoring the problem, not addressing it.
0	3	I guess it's kind of like, if the drug war ended, police budgets and the prison population would fall drastically. The biggest enemy is gone and thus, there's no point in spending all that money.  If there were effective ways to deal with CP on the internet and catch the predators that post it and prey on children, the argument follows that the copyright lobby loses their best excuse for so many restrictive laws.  Or at least, that's what I felt they were trying to get at. Could be wrong.
-	-	It's for "research" purposes, obviously.
0	8	what is kinda nuts is the juvenilization of our children is a pretty modern phenomena.  Not long ago they were expected to get married in their teens, fight wars, go to work, the whole nine yards.  As life got easier and we started to live a lot longer, we started to treat our children as more and more immature. It isnt that our children changed, or evolved.  They arent becoming more immature, we simply treat them that way.  Not that I think we should start letting our kids have porn, but people need to remember our kids arent stupid, they just act that way, and they really arent as young as we treat them, we just have that luxury due to technology. 
-	-	It's already done. They're using Tor and Freenet
0	2	"copyright industry"  ARG! I hate that phrase. Copyright is NOT an industry.  There are industries that use copyrights, but it's not an industry unto itself and the lawyers and corporations like Righthaven are trying to turn the legal system into an industry.   This is the kind of shit you get when you let corporations buy politicians and write the laws.
-	-	Freenet exists, so everything that's illegal to download by any means already has an avenue for distribution.
0	5	Is so sad to think that with the phrase "Child pornography is great", Johan Schlüter is just exploiting in a different way abused children worldwide. This should be consider a crime as well.
-	-	&gt; until the public takes a stand   The public isn't any smarter than politicians. Block half the web to "protect the children", most people will thank you.  &gt; politicians' re-elections are put at stake  Yeah, we could switch from a leftie who does exactly what the corporations tell him to do, to a rightie who does exactly what the corporations tell him to do. Good move.
1	4	That's a nice sentiment, but I don't think copyright law will be a big campaign issue anytime soon. In the US at least, the vast majority of people react the same way the politicians do: they don't understand file sharing so they don't have an opinion on that, but it becomes associated with child pornography and suddenly it's this terrible internet black market that needs to be shut down.  I'm not saying that people shouldn't become active about this issue though. Quite the contrary; I think waiting around for the next election isn't going to do shit. Write to politicians now, call in to radio shows, explain the issue to your conservative family members. The best thing that we can do is strive to inform the public as to why these laws are so bad so that at some point in the future our collective voice is big enough to be heard.
0	5	Sadly until the economy is fixed and we're no longer engaged in significant wars, this issue will never be a significant issue in re-election campaigns.    You should still apply pressure by writing your congress critter regularly about this issue (your do that don't you?), but you should have a realistic view on the threat of if being a factor in a re-election.  Your congress critter does.
-	-	[deleted]
0	8	Okay, fine. mistercow.  To restate:  The public will not be "starved of culture" by enforcing copyright laws, therfore...this cannot be "censorship."  Happy?  Or even more sad now?
0	8	Oh no trust me. I'm doing what I can, but that doesn't mean I'm particularly worried. I've petitioned everyone I can about it. Demandprogress.org sends me email updates about it from time to time and every petition they've asked me to sign, I've signed. I've sent emails to my congressmen. I've posted about it on my facebook wall multiple times asking for my friends to do the same. I'm not sitting around and hoping that nothing happens of it. I'm just saying that if somehow it does make it through into law, if the Supreme Court does what they were created to do, they will strike it down without thinking twice.
-	-	This supreme court has been putting the first amendment before any other concerns. Just look at citizens united. 
-	-	It is also likely intentional.  Obviously the best political tactic is to combat matters of concern to the populace simultaneously with those of concern to corporations.  However, this makes that compromise look like a pathetically weak argument for censorship by using farcical satire as a red herring.  Consider the People trolled.  That is, unless people are missing the point on purpose.
-	-	It's not an argument, it's a tactic. 
-	-	&gt;As life got easier and we started to live a lot longer, we started to treat our children as more and more immature.  Now i really worry about a future where the transhuman dream happens for the "elite" only...
0	2	&gt; juvenilization  They *are* juveniles. I think the term you want is "infantilization".
1	4	Absolutely!
-	-	I believe one study called that generation "the Lost Boys"
1	4	Apparently, we aren't the only dumb ones.
0	6	wut?
1	4	&gt;the man was Johan Schlüter, head of the **Danish** Anti-Piracy Group  &gt;**Denmark** was the first country to censor AllOfMP3.com, the (fully legal) Russian music store, and is now censoring The Pirate Bay off the internet.   &gt;In **Sweden**, the copyright industry lobbyist Per Strömbäck has publicly admitted it being one of his best arguments.
-	-	Denmark; not Denver.
0	7	On the contrary, I find her to be a very talented artist, and you may too if you could get over her outlandish styles and behavior.  However, I don't know whether you have any sort of musical background or understanding of the subject, and don't care to speculate.
-	-	Post it on Facebook and watch people [lose it](http://literallyunbelievable.org/)
0	2	Man, I really hate all those supid people.
0	5	Unfortunately, until the public takes a stand and politicians' re-elections are put at stake, the copyright industry is going to get whatever they want.
0	1	Child pornography can be printed on paper. Lets block all access to paper, that should stop it.   
-	-	Freenet is slow and unreliable.  Then again, I haven't used it in years, so maybe it's improved.
0	2	And an avenue in which it can't be tracked, doesn't need to be stored on the host computer, and can't be taken down without taking down the network.
-	-	When copyrights are the only thing you're really selling, then yes that's your industry. Music/movies are just a by-product, hence the idea of stifling culture raised in the article. 
0	3	And as with everything, be it terrorism, or drug dealing (situation in mexico for example), the normal everyday people are the ones that pay the price while the people perpetrating the crimes just find other ways to do commit them.   
-	-	People have opinions on a lot of things they don't understand.  We just need a way to make them think they understand it enough to form an opinion on it.
-	-	&gt; When it's time for elections they will bring up terrorism, a few sex scandals and other shit so that the media will cover that instead of important issues. Once they're elected, they push shit like OPs to pay back what they promised companies to do to get $$$ for campaining.  That's two sentences.
0	3	No no. Exploiting children for pleasure is wrong. Exploiting them for capital gain is honorable.
1	6	What should be considered a crime?
-	-	Obviously we need to ban these Tor and Freenet things.
-	-	if only the tor network could uses its powers for good...
0	2	However, unlike fox, we do not have direct trusted lines into supid people's brains. 
-	-	i did but i couldn't find it :(
0	2	&gt;But politicians don’t understand that file sharing is bad, and this is a problem for us.   But politicians don’t **care** that file sharing is bad **for us**, and this is a problem for us.  FTFH(im) ;-)  BTW, what he actually wanted to say is:  But politicians want a lot of lobby money to "decide" that file sharing is bad. It's cheaper to play the child porn card. 
0	8	I hope these people die in a fire. Seriously.
-	-	It's no coincidence that Copyright Protection shares the same initials.
-	-	Me too.
-	-	changeme
1	4	I laugh myself to sleep every night with the absurdity that is America.
0	1	&gt;"All this in defense of their lucrative monopoly that starves the public of culture."  Fucking hell, that is such bullshit.  It's not my place to explain all of copyright to you, but I wish someone would.  In short:  Censorship is not the idea that you will be forced to pay or borrow something instead of downloading it to keep for an infinite amount of time.  May the gods help us, **this is not censorship**!  
-	-	TIL Copyright Lobby is Muslim
1	4	I2P works fairly well, I guess.
-	-	*allegedly*.
0	1	Damn those freedom-hating hackers and their child pornography. Why isn't someone doing something about this?
-	-	You hope. 
-	-	lately I'm not so sure I have that much faith in the Supreme court to actually follow the constitution or do the right thing.  I suspect that what ever happens, it will be a 5-4 split.
1	8	So you're not going to worry till it's too late.
1	7	Right. I'm sure Thomas will recuse himself this time for whatever bribes he took from the lobbyists.
-	-	Unless it gets implemented as an agreement between big media and the ISPs (sometimes one and the same, thanks to cable delivered Internet).
-	-	Supreme court justices dont cost that much more than congressmen.
0	2	So what you're saying is its just as bad as before.....The world has always been shit
-	-	&gt; Scale is based on the average worldwide traffic of child pornography in all years. Learn more?  No thanks, Google. I'm good. 
-	-	And I've got the lube.
-	-	I'll grab the game board.
-	-	In fact let's just arrest everyone. We're all using this "internet" thing, off to jail with us!
-	-	Those entities existed originally to facilitate the distribution of content from artists who otherwise lacked the resources to do that on their own. In a digital era where their services are no longer necessary, the only successful business model they have is to fight legal battles in court. Therefore, their industry is copyright law, not music.
1	4	Yes. And a very frustrating one. Although the guy with the upvotes has the better definition of industry. 
-	-	You know what also can harbor child pornography?  AUTOMOBILES.  If everyone were forced to ride bikes and use only approved carrying bags (CLEAR PLASTIC) then no one could hide child pornography in their vehicles.  Pretty much the same for homes!  We should all be required to have cameras in every room filming every angle so no child pornography can be stored.
-	-	The movie and music publishing companies are still in those businesses. What they've done though is to create organizations(MPAA,RIAA) to fight copyright infringement for them. It's those organizations that have now turned that into a business model. While they want to call it an industry, it's nothing more than the court system being gamed into a revenue generator. Copyright is just the tool they are using to make money in the Lawsuit industry.
0	3	Think of the children!
-	-	I completely agree, it probably WON'T happen but it should. It will take to the point of normal people being fined for YouTube videos with music in the background for the public to care. People don't act on an issue until it affects them personally in most cases. Hopefully it won't be too late by the time that happens.
-	-	[Relevant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Live_in_Public)
-	-	And you'll have to go too, you know too much.
-	-	Oh yeah, I totally forgot about I2P. I guess that's the anonymity problem sorted. Now if only I could turn the site into a continuous chain of trust such that the main server can go down without stopping the party... I'd sooner be caught hiding PCs in corporate server rooms than try to defend a "/b/ without mods" site in court. 
1	4	Your comment is hilarious :D
-	-	&gt; From the same logic since I can download CP through a regular stream downloading should be illegal.  Stop giving them ideas.
-	-	I once told this this guy i wished this was his last birthday on earth and didnt recieve as many downvotes as you... And I can see no reason for it, your voicing your opinion and furthering discussion. 
-	-	Hmmm. They certainly are the *Fox News* of the torrent world in that they feel that their ideas are being silenced and they tell the "other side" of the story.  However, they do not claim to be "fair and balanced", and nor do I think they are mistaken in their assumption. They represent ideas that are bad for the RIAA/MPAA but are essential for the growth of our society as a whole.  I do not like the way they add a flair of sensationalism to news, but one must understand that most people *do not understand* the gravity of the issue, and base their opinions not on reasoning and thought, but almost entirely on such exaggerated news.  In the end, it comes down to whoever can come up with a catchier propaganda brigade. Why do you think we have advertisements, anyway?  Edit: if you want a more nuanced discussion of the issue, follow the writings of the EFF, Cory Doctrow, Lawrence Lessig, groklaw, et al.
-	-	Ikea already has those for sale.
1	6	I don't know why you're being downvoted, you're completely right. While I do support their cause, their "reporting" is utter trash. 
-	-	If one lives in a glass house...  Sorry I don't know if that's remotely relevant, just seemed like an appropriate thing to say. 
1	4	Fapping in a house with plexiglass walls? CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.
-	-	They love child pornography as much as they love hackers.  If it isn't porn, then is hackers coming out to get you.  And that's why hacker's have been in the frontpages lately.  Soon enough it will be, gotta protect the internet from the hackers who hate our freedoms.
1	4	Great article.
0	2	The world is slowly becoming a shit hole. Only those with money/born with money can enjoy life while others are subjected to various "laws". Its going back to the earlier days when the rich British royals sat on their ass while everyone worked under them.
1	4	I'm not particularly worried about this. If PROTECT-IP somehow is passed, the Supreme Court will smite it down so fast the RIAA will shit themselves. 
-	-	Impingement of internet freedoms aside, when has policing the distribution method of an illicit "good" ever been more effective than policing the source? There have been smugglers almost as long as there have been prostitutes and lawyers.
-	-	dunno if that worths anything : http://www.google.com/trends?q=child+pornography%2C+illegal+download
-	-	&gt;“We are developing a child pornography filter in cooperation with the IFPI and the MPA so we can show politicians that filtering works,  This is the most inane thing I have ever heard. Much of child pornography only exists in closed off forums and deep websites without any means of tracking them. The only websites that they're capable of even finding are those that they themselves set up.

1	6	Yes, in reference to the censorship of websites devoted to file sharing. Prosecuting copyright infringement is not censorship. But shutting down or blocking sites that tell you how to infringe copyright *is* censorship.  You still haven't explained why you included a quote which is irrelevant to your comment.
1	6	Manifesto of the Communist Party?
-	-	of course i do, this is reddit.   
0	2	Except not really. The point of the copyright is to give distributors who invest in producing content (extremely expensive) the ability to have a monopoly on its production, which is super cheap. The digital world hasn't changed this at all, in fact its made the up front investment in producing a work an even bigger portion of the total cost of production. Movies and games simply would not be viable to produce without copyright, at least in the private sector.  The argument also seems to be built on the idea that: &gt;The prices of content used to be proportional to the cost of distributing it.  Which has never been true, at least in the past couple hundred years. If it was, artists would not be paid.
0	2	Yes, the author explained this in his article. I still feel that his wording and implication was intentional, which is all I was saying.
0	1	Clearly. They both downvoted the comment!
-	-	just so you know, I do not register (in my mind) the content of posts that begin with the sentence "This.".
-	-	You mean like the military and defense budgets did after the end of the cold war?
-	-	Obviously we need to ban you. 
-	-	Not true. I'm proposing that if the people who are in charge of music/movies focused on adapting their business models to modern trends and technology instead of focusing all of their energy on fighting copyright battles in court then we would have better products to show for it. When their focus is on their product, they will be a music/movie industry. Right now, they exist only to fight copyright legal battles.

1	2	Because we don't want to be as stupid as they are, and that we respect the people we are addressing.  We don't want to use the same tactics because we do not think that the general population is stupid, as they happen to assume
-	-	Because *Torrentfreak* is the *Fox News* of the torrent world.  I wish they would just report on the issue fairly and accurately, but they continually resort to juvenile tactics like this and should not be taken seriously.
-	-	 I dunno dude, this is one of those quotes that are even more fucking disgusting in context.
0	2	This headline is an outrageous case of syllogistical perversion, all written media uses headlines, ergo all written journalism falls into a permanent accidental fallacy.
-	-	The article did use their tactics...  It goes from a rational argument talking about how they use child pornography to censor file sharing to saying that "the copyright lobby is actively trying to hide egregious crimes against children."  Just a bit misleading and inflammatory, no?
1	4	I'm going to have to agree with you on this one.  While I can get behind the statement that the lobby is only bringing up CP to further heir own agenda, and wouldn't think twice about it otherwise, I'm having a hard time extending that logic to "they're actively trying to hide crimes against children."  (Not to say the lobby's argument isn't BS, because it totally is.)
1	4	Why do we not use their tactics? Lets cherry pick that quote.   "Child pornography is great", *Johan Schlüter anti-piracy lobbier*  
-	-	If the people in charge of making these laws actually understood technology they would realise these filters are pointless anyway and it'll just make the pedophiles use smarter ways of sharing.  Putting a blanket over a problem doesn't make that problem disappear
0	5	I hear the Copyright Lobby raped and killed a girl in 1990.
-	-	Censorship is still possible on Freenet, it's just really difficult. Last time I used it there was some quiet furor over a program that collected key names for CP-related files and removed relevant blocks from a user's heap. That sort of node cleansing plus a lot of artificial traffic between cleansed nodes would slowly rarify blocks out of proportion to their popularity. As soon as any part of a of large file leaves the network, the whole file is dead weight.
-	-	The transhuman dream will happen *first* with the elites. I believe the real singularity will transform them into something so completely inhuman that the poor will be able to follow them, later, and it will not matter, because they won't be entering into the same power game that they left.  At least, that's how I dream it'll happen.
0	8	&gt;exploiting in a different way abused children worldwide.  When someone uses, as mean to reach is goals, other people distress. 
0	6	I doubt it. The storage and transmission method isn't built for speed, so even if everyone in the world was connected to it via fat pipes, it would be sluggish most of the time. AFAIK it's still the go-to protocol for things you can't or shouldn't find anywhere else.  Recently I've been thinking about replacements. Not for CP specifically, but to generally further the cause of a censorship-resistant internet. The current frontrunner is a 4chan clone where attachments turn into torrents and every page includes "torrentclient.js," but that still leaves a lot of users with a lot of other users' IP addresses and some presumably traceable initial seeding behavior.

It started in the UK in 2005 (I happened to be visiting the House of Commons when the first reading took place - it was sponsored by BT and talked about putting filters on all ISPs so that "the kids could be protected". Sadly that got rolled out a number of years ago, and it is only time before its reach extends to copyright issues.)  Edit: [found it](http://visionnext.com.cn/en/2006-5-22-1.htm) - it was a private members bill put forward by Margaret Moran in October 2005, initially as a "voluntary" filter - that was the first inkling of Internet filtering being proposed as law, that I have encountered. Even while I was sat there in the viewer's gallery, I was fuming, knowing *exactly* where that would be heading. Of course, when an [MP is on the take](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/labour-mps-expenses/8060216/MPs-expenses-Margaret-Moran-may-be-fifth-MP-to-face-court.htm) you start to question the motivation of every bill they submit for first reading.

1	4	This depends entirely on your opinion of intellectual property and freedom of information. Should you believe people can own an idea or the media that they create, you would be inclined to agree that it is not censorship but enforcement of property rights.  In my opinion, intellectual property is a completely broken system. It worked before we had systems that could copy and distribute data in microseconds, when we had to physically press vinyl records, produce film rolls, and use printing presses to distribute books. The digital world of the last thirty years has put an end to this line of thinking, and our laws simply don't work with it.  The prices of content used to be proportional to the cost of distributing it. It now is so cheap to distribute a song or an HD movie that prices have been inflated proportional to the costs of manufacturing that media. No, piracy is not a pricing problem, the pricing problem is a symptom of a much larger issue.  Technology *far* outpaces the efforts of legislation to enforce intellectual property. As information becomes easier to publish and obtain, many forms of publishing will rise that enhance the plausible deniability of participants. Eventually, at some abstract level, it is impossible to distinguish "intellectual property" from speech. It becomes raw information that cannot be filtered or censored. This is not a pipe dream, this is the reality of the technologies that we have seen developed in the last decade.  This is hard for people to grasp, let alone politicians. A majority of the industrialized world's global economy has some (in)direct dependence on intellectual property (mostly on patents), and in a world where even a slight amount of piracy is tolerable you must prepare for *all* piracy to be tolerable.  Any idea why software patents have caused such a stir, while other types of patents haven't been met with as much criticism? Not only does software have a deep connection with natural laws and mathematic principles (for example, programming patterns or virtual machine optimizations), but holding a monopoly over an idea that can be distributed and recreated with little effort and resources is absurd. This is the basis by which intellectual property of all forms (including copyright) have been abused and are only counter-productive to society at this point.  The world is changing drastically, and the perception of blocking copyright infringing content can amount to censorship.

-	-	This doesn't surprise me at all.  I took my mother to go get a new cell phone yesterday and all she wanted was something simple.  Verizon only had 4 phones out of all the phones on display that didn't require you to pick up a data plan as well.  Those 4 phones that she had to choose from seemed less than up to par with many of the non smart phones they had out the last few years.

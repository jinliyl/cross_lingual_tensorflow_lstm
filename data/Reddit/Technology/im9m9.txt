-	-	No, or I've never been zapped anyway :) 
0	2	Ugh, sometimes you have to push the buttons (the buttons are just signs on the glass) multiple times before they react. And it's kind of slow - if you want to increase the heat from, say, 2 to 8, you have to push the + button 6 times. Half of those times the button doesn't work so it's 9 times, really. On a conventional stove, you would turn the knob in less than a second. Also, the displays are kind of cryptic - they can only show numbers and weird symbols, like [this](http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00CeEtqUSWZMhn/LED-Digital-Number-Display-1.jpg). Another thing: when you leave a hot pan on the stove it will start beeping after a while. It beeps a lot, now that I think of it.  If it worked like in the video, it would be awesome though.
1	6	Cool, never seen anything like that.
1	4	Cool, next question. Wiki says:  &gt;"This field induces an electric current in the pot. Current flowing in the metal pot produces resistive heating which heats the food."  This doesn't mean that the pot/pan is electrified and will zap you if you touch it, does it?
-	-	Well, it has to be magnetic, which most jewelry metals are not.
-	-	Yeah I forgot about holding the button. But it's still crap.
0	2	Just don't wear a metal ring when it's on.
-	-	I've never had that problem. I also have + and - heat setting buttons, but they react correctly and you can click and hold to change it quickly. Although I'd still prefer one like the one in the video, with a full touch screen where you can turn a virtual nob or slider.

1	6	"OK yes" isn't that a little redundant crazy future lady?
-	6	Where was the glass dildo?
1	6	&gt; As one person walks along, we see giant pictures of her (or her avatar?) leaping up the walls of buildings. And when she walks into a store, she's shown pictures of herself in the clothes she might want to try on.  What is the blog accompanying the video talking about? The wife buying clothes in the store and the model that's being displayed on the glass are clearly different people. The narrative of the video also shows the management meeting that decides which model will be shown on the wall of the building and used in the catalog, so it's not as if the wife has images of herself following her around wherever she goes. On the other hand, all the appliances in her home and in the store instantly recognize her as "Jennifer", so there is some kind of identification going on.   Also, how the hell did she get from lazing around in bed to fully dressed in the car in less than 20 minutes?
-	-	Thought some idiot meshed in music to make it "creepy". Nope, my own stupidity. I unmuted and was still playing portal 2 music in the background. How is this creepy? A few cheesy moments ya.

The mum gets up without any clothes and half the shopping mall that grandma is in gets to see her naked. Meanwhile, dad puts the phone down on the wrong part of the kitchen top and the heater switches on and the fridge just starts beeping for no reason. Whilst dad tries to find out why the fridge is beeping (theres an advert inside the fridge that the dad "needs" to see) the phone gets cooked.  Meanwhile, the kid clicks on an "attachment" and a giant goatse appears on the worktop whilst the words "GAY" scream loudly.

-	-	God damn my dad bought a LCD 40 inch 720p for 2,800 dollars. The prices went down so much after that...
1	6	That's along the lines of my thinking as well. However, not all people can be producers and with driverless cars it seems like there 'might' not be too much work here.   Hopefully there will be ome sort of agricultural breakthrough soon that will allow us to cheaply feed the masses. There might not be jobs for everyone, but if people are well fed and warm can they be that mad at their robot replacements?
1	4	Convection is ovens, [I think.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_oven)  Anyway, [induction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_cooker) uses an electromagnet to heat up the pan(which has to be magnetic). It's super fast, and you can bring a big pan of water up to a boil in under a minute.
-	-	Normal stoves generate heat themselves and project that heat onto the pan.  Induction uses a magnetic field to cause the pan itself to heat up.
-	6	Why, what's wrong with it? 
1	5	Didn't notice that, but I was more distracted by YouTube's blocking the bit on the bottom. I decided to just ignore them instead of trying to decipher them.
1	4	TOUCH SCREEN ALL THE THINGS!
1	4	These big touch screens everywhere come in the vein of the Microsoft ~~table~~ Surface* where the idea is that you will have large but static dumb terminals everywhere and most of your information is stored in the cloud. While this didn't seem to catch on to the degree they were expecting, it could be because we don't have that good touch based interfaces yet. Windows 8 does seem to angling itself to be more touch friendly, where the default screen is a tiled touch interface like the phone one. Unless we develop a good touch based keyboard or an alternative text input these things can't really thrive - have you ever tried typing long documents on an ipad?
-	-	Marketers are not reasoned.
-	-	I've been waiting for some of the car tech though.  If my calendar shows that I have to be at the airport by 8:00 AM, couldn't it talk to the GPS and intelligently route things?  The airport is 27 miles away.  The car has enough gas for 30 miles, insufficient for round trip.  Add gas station to route; Chevron has highest preference.  Added trip and average morning traffic adds half an hour to standard travel time, move departure time up by 35-minutes.
-	-	I didn't think io9 was that blogspammy. 
1	7	Thank you.
-	-	Maybe the meeting wasn't at her office.
-	-	Some people have memory retention issues and memory retention issues.
-	6	While I agree wholeheartedly that its kind of depressing, what else are people going to do? The higher technology a society gets the less people are required for manufacturing jobs and the larger the service industry gets. If everything is eventually made and maintained by robots what jobs are the majority of the population going to have?
-	6	Maybe if it is linked with traffic data.
-	-	YouTube displays its watermark by default. They should have disabled it, though.
-	-	The video made it seem safe for use as a table, like a glass table today. And the stove I have has a touch interface under the glass, but with LED lights, not a screen. If it were like the video, I'm pretty sure it would be spill-safe.
-	6	Close enough? [Patent suggests location- and traffic-aware iOS calendar alerts](http://www.tuaw.com/2011/06/02/patent-suggests-location-and-traffic-aware-ios-calendar-alerts/) 
1	4	Whole Gawker "network" is ;)   Truth is io9 in particular isn't *that* bad... but it's still Gawker.
-	-	I like the concept, but I've got to say I love my induction stove. If they had this with induction I would definitely get it.
1	4	I searched Gawker and now can completely agree with you. 
1	4	Yeah, mine too. I'm sure the next generation of them will have touch screens like in the video. It would be nice to use heat setting sliders instead of touch "buttons."

1	6	Why can't TV's be released past 1080p?
-	-	It's like Star Trek but in glass!
-	-	Germs just strengthen your immune system.  People worry too much about sanitizing everything all the time.
-	-	Economist/Techie here. Nope, just kidding.  It'll end up just like the industrial age where people were forced out of their jobs. Those who didn't have a job were forced to do something else. This is obvious but this is what's going to happen.  Hopefully the economy will be better so we can afford to roll out massive unemployment checks while the unemployed search for tech jobs or go to tech school or take computer competency courses.  My guess is:  Marketing and advertising will take over. People will make money not by doing a service, but by producing content and using ads as a primary source of income. The amount of income is proportional to the quality of your content.  Physical stuff will still be very popular. I don't know if it's feasible but almost everything could be delivered to you, like groceries and other things. Human drivers will be obsolete in a couple decades.   Computers and tech-oriented jobs will be dominant.
1	4	I have an "ass old CRT" but it's 720p.  One of the first mass-produced HD TV's.  Bought it in 2005 for $1000.  It's 34".  &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;  I pray every night the thing would break so I can go out and get a bigger, better TV for less money

-	-	Definitely, knew a girl once (19yrs old) who memorized how to get to work, the store, and a few other places exclusively by main roads. For literally *anything* else had to rely on a GPS navigator. That includes if there was construction or something and she had to take an alternate route from one of her memorized ones.
0	1	I think the most disappointing part of that advertisement is it presents the future as beautiful people using technology to design and purchase fashion apparel. Nothing productive, just fulfilling some stupid desire.  Fuck everything about that. This is not the future a reasoned person would envision.
0	1	What kind of fucking ass hole little kid just puts their dirty shoes on the counter top like that. Also enjoy fingerprints everywhere.   Also no ugly people allowed in the future. 
-	-	The Culture novels by Iain M. Banks take this concept to its logical conclusion. They take place in a futuristic society where no-one has done any real work in thousands of years, having been thoroughly supplanted by nearly-all-powerful (but totally benevolent) AIs.
-	-	Yeah, but the only other things most people do are fuck and take a shit.  The see-through smart glass toilet still isn't a big seller in the future.
1	4	Yea, I know. But I live in a 3rd world country where most of the population doesn't have access to running water or decent health care. I'm quite happy being a germaphobe.
-	-	They can but that requires a whole new host of technologies that those companies aren't currently deeply invested in squeezing every dollar out of already.   I've had ass old CRT's with her resolutions.
-	-	Or the Jetsons...
-	-	Tell that to HIV, TB, tetanus, measles etc...
-	-	*"Will they manufacture fake jobs to give the illusion of employment?"*  Those will be video-games, or, as we'd picture them from our present day perspective, "virtual realities".
-	-	In general I would recommend Pandora Star and its sequels. Deals with a society where for the most part people don't have to do "actual work", doesn't get into anything gritty with it, and its story involves other things entirely. I've read others with similar societies(though can't remember their names for the life of me atm...) general consensus seems to be that:  a) human service will be a luxury item(think actual human waiters, etc.)  b) at some level there will always be humans administering the machines/robots  c) consumerism will explode
1	4	I'm really interested in this answer. 
-	-	will they need to prevent an uprising? After all, who will own the robots? The capitalists. Who will own the security robots? The capitalists.   If the common man is completely cut out of the system, in that he poses no threat, and he can offer no labour or anything, the rich and powerful could literally kill us all off. =/
-	-	Because their layout change is still awful and I will NOT tolerate any site in the network
-	3	It's scary because I can finally imagine this happening.   In the past all of the 'Smart Home' hype always left me underwhelmed, but now I can totally see an Android/iOS style operating system living on a whole slather of interactive screens around the house. It would more or less be a shared interface to one central machine and would allow some pretty **cool** stuff to happen.  I think the problem is that, at heart, it's still just **cool**. I can't really imagine it being useful except to further connect our lives to the information superhighway and further erode our connection with the real world, and the very real people within that world.
1	4	Great, ipads everywhere in the future... can't wait
0	2	1)  I kind of don't want to be a Borg, you know?  2)  I already hate appliances where I have to painstakingly navigate through 7 layers of menus to get to what I want, and it is impossible to just walk up to it and use it if you haven't before. Also BMW learned a lesson years ago with a console in one of their autos. If you wanted to change the volume, you had to drill down endlessly, increasing accident chances.  3)  When we are all conditioned to instant connectivity, some will freak out if it is lost. And it WILL get lost sometimes, or be hackerforced upon us. What's going to happen when our phone becomes our wallet, and the phone is lost or stolen, or the cell network fails? (Happened in San Diego when Navy system tests interfered.)  4)  The more capable but complex a system becomes, the harder it can fall, especially when you depend on it. The future will great, until times when it breaks.

1	4	Sounds Great, until some jerkwad with a slingshot takes out every screen for the hell of it. It's public property (the bus stop) so it's ok to smash it all up to shit and spray it with dipshit tags, isn't it?  Just as has happened nearby on the freeway with the transparent glass sound barriers - all smashed.  No wonder every bus stop and train station is made of steel mesh and concrete - place looks like a frickin' jail.
-	-	Hey, it's that one video from four months ago!
-	-	windex for the win lol
-	-	The fact that several times people would touch the screen without it reacting just made me cringe. How could technology ever possibly know the difference between 'I'm swiping to move this window' and 'I'm swiping because I'm a fucking idiot randomly touching the screen.'
-	-	Car.
1	4	obviously they are in Soviet Russia of the future.
-	-	&gt;Also no ugly people allowed in the future.  I want to see the Louis C.K. version of this commercial where all of these technologies conspire to make his life more difficult and he accidentally sends his porn collection to the side of an office building.

0	2	I could see the stove being available for sale pretty soon, the windows and car stuff, too, but I think some, like the fridge door and kitchen counter screens are pretty useless and prohibitively expensive.

1	4	Got it at around $16 a share.  I'm in it for the long haul.  Hope everything in the video comes true.
-	-	Absolutely... just as an example meet [Microsoft surface](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en/us/default.aspx) (for those who didn't know or thought it died)   Now back in 08-09 those were I think in the $12-15k range. This year they are clocking in at about [$7,600](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/ces-new-microsoft-surface-to-be-priced-at-7600/8368). Now try to imagine extending that cost to each surface that you want to be interactive. Not that many people are going to buy a $8,000+ refrigerator.   Now that may drop fairly quickly. Up to now each one is custom built and the applications were built just for that order. Not too long ago they put windows 7 on it and released a SDK with a new one coming out soon. As more people end up with windows touch devices I'm sure the software side will get better but we still have a bit of a chicken-egg problem to overcome and in general problems like that take a very long time to deal with.
1	4	My induction stove has a touch interface. Sure, it's not multi-touch and it doesn't have a real display, but the paradigm is there.
0	1	I have microfiber cloths. It's like kids hands produce super concentrated oils that are resistant to electronics cleaners and microfiber. Shit just smudges worse...
-	-	I doubt the stove thing will adopt unless you use your stove just for the touch screen. Spill a little bit of water and the touch screen is unusable.
1	4	You're not at all nitpicking, you are right. It is a common problem, too.  On the monitor in front of me there are five buttons, all labeled in black on a black case. I counted that I had to do 8 button pushes in a sequence to change the brightness, and then 5 times to exit. The product designers need to be horsewhipped with a taser while being waterboarded and then made to play Duke Nukem III while being forced to eat kimchi.
-	6	You have germans in your stove?
0	2	What's the chance of this actually happening sometime soon? (to some extent)   Also, too many GUIs!
-	-	Let me tell you why this will never happen.  Technology companies don't like to share.  Whenever one company comes up with a fancy idea (even if it had been speculated in future videos like this one for years) they patent it.  They then proceed to sue the pants off anyone who makes something even remotely similar.  Videos like this foresee a future of seamless integration of all devices.  Your phone connects to your TV, your table, your car, the signs in the mall.  Media can be streamed between all of them instantly and wirelessly.  It all sounds amazing, doesn't it?  Let me put this into perspective now.  The MPEG-LA owns a patent on a video format, and they charge app developers who want to support it per-download.  Amazon owns a patent on making a purchase with previously-entered and stored billing information.  When Apple released the first-generation iPhone, one thing they made very clear was that they had patented their multitouch implementation.  *And their fans in the room cheered at this.*  Does anyone really think the seamless integration shown in this video will ever happen when companies today are suing each other left and right over trivial user interface elements?  Oh, and not to mention all the competing proprietary "standards" that each of these companies push.  AirPlay, DirectX, FaceTime, etc.  These companies don't work together and never will.  I see free software as our best bet for a future of interoperable devices, but patent troubles would seem to cause problems there.
1	4	Glass stove.  So you can see where the cockroaches are hiding.
1	4	Cool idea... BUT, I already have finger smudges on my LCD from my 3 year old. I don't want to break out the Windex every five minutes. On a lighter note; glass cleaners, maids, and Windex would see an increase in business.
-	-	&gt; Especially the interface where you plop your phone down onto a surface and it instantly networks with it and allows you to get a large screen version of the data on your mobile.  ... and 'instantly' forwards your browsing history, calls and address book to someone like Google.
1	4	This glass will finally make the lives of rich, attractive, white people a little bit easier.
-	-	&gt; A world made of glass may promise easy information access, but it also seems to be a world where everybody is always looking at themselves and each other to an alarming degree.  How fitting, then, that the business in the video is a fashion design company?

0	2	It is the fucking Apple universe and we all know it. Every time someone watches that, Steve Jobs' prostate is massaged ever so gently.
0	2	For the same reason that we now have 3d being shoved down our damn throats. The companies involved in the tech businesses have all but lost their focus and creativity.   You can only squeeze so many pixels on a device or make something so fast before technology runs up against barriers that lab monkeys cannot surpass so they look for ways to force technologies that the public have veto'd off as innovative.  Can't release TV's with higher than 1080p resolutions? Fuck it, make that shit 3d then.   This particular instance of video phone's being shown in every 'idea of the future' demo is the latest instance of a phenomenon I noticed a while back where conveniences are recycled over and over again.  Take for example the mouse. We invented the mouse to get away from the keyboard, then we invented keyboard shortcuts to get away from the mouse. Same thing with Phones.  We invented phones so we could get away from writing to someone. Then we invented txting so we could get away from having to talk to them. 
0	6	It's still fascinating how many people seem to think it would be a fantastic idea to talk to people while having to hold your phone in front of your face the entire time for video to work.
1	4	I noticed that too.  It seems that everything has invisible cameras built in; on the bright side, at least everyone is rich...
1	6	This is one of the things I find to be a fascinating subject.  How does a society adjust when 30% or more of the population couldn't work regardless of desire, experience, or education?  Will companies and investors be forced to provide a certain level of life style to prevent an uprising?  Will they manufacture fake jobs to give the illusion of employment?   Can anyone recommend any Sci-fi books that deal with this subject?

-	-	Those of us who are approaching ancient would frequently see fantasy like this at Expositions and World's Fairs. Most of the futuristic mock-ups never came to be as initially envisioned. It is fun to see how some ideas evolved while others failed and a few morphed into something somewhat resembling what we use today.  "Dick Tracy's wristwatch"... no, but a SmartPhone is getting there and in the interim step were the PDAs and iPods.
0	1	"People who live in glass houses shouldn't! Because this is what happens!" - Mr. Furious
-	-	Why the obsession with videophones being in every "THIS IS THE FUTURE" flick? We've had the technology for years. No one wants to use videophones. I barely even use my smartphone as a talking phone. I can't imagine ever using it for video. 
1	4	Some cool concepts there. But it just isn't providing utility for investment. It's possible right now to put massive touch screen displays on every surface in our home, but why on earth would you want to?

1	4	They even changed the layout on all their international sites, so now even the one or two interesting articles their network might have each *month* are just not worth it. That's disregarding the terrible work their employees do and all the crap they pull.
1	4	I think the problem most people have with these sorts of things is that they think that the technology lessens reality, when it fact it only changes it. No less, no more, only different. The concept of a 'real' world is a fiction; it is as we perceive it to be, but never exists outside of that.  I can perhaps say only one thing, that is the last shred of romanticism left within me. Insolong as books continue to be material constructs, even with virtual counterparts, I see no harm in these advancements into a more and more virtual age.
-	-	Technology by itself does not erode connections. I can contact just about anyone in the world using the net anytime. If you are talking about the illusion of connections through things like facebook then maybe. Although without things like that there wouldn't be any relationship or it would simply stop at small talk.  The scary bit has more to do with the control of your information. Who accesses it, what could be accessed, or how easy it would be to access.
1	4	It's the next logical step.  ~1990 to ~2000: We wired up millions of computers all over the world creating the internet.  ~2000 to ~2005:  We filled the net with an insane amount of content and continue adding more every day.  ~2005 to current: The technology got so small and so cheap that we could access the web from the palm of our hands.  going forward: the tech gets even cheaper and smaller so the web essentially seeps into most of the things we have contact with every day.

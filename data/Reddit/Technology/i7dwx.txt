0	2	I'll prove you wrong:  An apple product has a positive attribute.  *Edit:* 2 days have now passed...and nothing.  I am fucking baffled...
0	1	XD this guy
0	1	BS.  Where did you go to school?  Namibia? I apologize.  Bad spelling and writing just turn my fucking crank. People who get their spelling corrected FOR FREE should be grateful.
0	2	* *Too* bad...
1	6	My mind can't process this comment.
0	1	Oh Rupert, didnt your friend Tom tell you are buying garbage? There were little done to chance myspace to make it competitive. Sad...
0	2	I actually thought at one point Myspace had more promise then Facebook, actually I still think at one point it definetely did. To bad everything Murdoch touches turns to shit. Also, I learned i had more "friends" then the former "buff, bronzed former Baywatch child star" did on Myspace. 
0	5	The idea was nice, but eventually became the ghetto of social website. Watch how facebook will risk the same faith.
0	2	I never liked Myspace because it allowed people to do the design of their own pages.  They invariably created some ugly monstrosity that played music in the background or something.  Its never a good idea to let the general population do web design.
0	2	*  ...tell you *you* are buying garbage?   * *was* little done...   * ...to *change* myspace...
0	2	*  ...promise *than* Facebook...   *  ... at one point it *definitely* did.   *  ..."friends" *than* the former...
1	6	And who will be the next big social network star?
-	-	* of *a* social website.
0	1	*I'm not typing an essay  *but a quick response on a message board  *so go fuck yourself &amp; die.
0	2	Dude, you're on r/technology, it's a cesspool of a subreddit. Don't bother correcting people here. It's as futile in this subreddit as suggesting an apple product has a positive attribute.

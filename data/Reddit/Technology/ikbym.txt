0	2	Sweet. Now the EPO just needs to get on the horn with the USPTO and revoke that shit cause it passed in the US
0	3	It's too easy to buy things online. This button makes me nervous every damn time I go on Amazon.  I was on Ebay a few years ago dicking around and wondered how much it'd cost to ship body armor or something stupid like that. I somehow ended up buying the body armor so now I have a kevlar vest in my closet.
1	6	Problem? I think not.
0	5	This is a good first step.  Unfortunately, it won't have that much effect, since the functionality still enjoys protection under US law.    I have always wondered how the USPTO could justify allowing protection for something so obvious and trivial.  I just assumed it was another piece of the corporatocracy that is so pervasive here.
0	2	&gt;It's too easy to buy things online.   I agree, in part.  It gets addictive, but that is on you, not them.  You can hardly blame them for making it easy to buy their products.  It's up to you whether you want to store your credit card info, for example.  Having to type that every time would certainly curtain my buying a bit (specifically on Amazon).  &gt;This button makes me nervous every damn time I go on Amazon.  It would make me nervous too, that's why I just [disable it](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468628).  &gt;I somehow ended up buying the body armor so now I have a kevlar vest in my closet.  I've bought stuff on eBay accidentally, but fortunately it was a relatively cheap lesson.  The nice thing about eBay, though, is that you can simply sell the item again and recoup some of your costs.  Heck, what make and size is it?  People here (or, more likely, on /r/guns) may be interested.

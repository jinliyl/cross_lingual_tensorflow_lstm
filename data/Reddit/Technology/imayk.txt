-	-	and they say the *digital* revolution is weird.
-	-	Additive manufacturing will be the future of manufacturing.  Following from synn89's comment, there's already an industry for everyone (not just designers/engineers) enabling persons to send their solid model files for print. [Sculpteo](http://www.sculpteo.com/en/gallery/start/) for instance provide examples of what they can print &amp; current prices.  [A lot of these parts can't actually be made through conventional manufacturing processes ( i.e. milling, lathe work, injection moulding, casting etc..](http://www.sculpteo.com/en/gallery/?cat=science_mechanics#cat=game_puzzle)
0	6	Yes, but is it more energy intensive to pour some molten metal into a cast and let it cool, or have it spin on a lathe while you apply a chisel, or have a 3d printer chip away at it bit by bit?
-	-	Well with the proper modeling software you could design the tools you didn't already have in your collection as you need them. No need to scan them, just get out a cad program and make em yourself.
1	4	It really isn't. Consider that all the left over powder(material) is likely re-usable.  Then consider that you're completely eliminating the assembly line and shipping process if these stations were near you. In this case, you'd license the "wrench" blueprint, maybe resize it to meet your specific job's needs and then print it out locally at Home Depot.  It's really good for 1 off jobs and rare parts as well. Consider a bumper for your car. Currently practice: Factory in China makes a bunch of bumpers. They get ship to distribution warehouses. You go to your local car dealership. They have to then ship from a warehouse to your dealer.   3d printing a bumper: Raw material gets shipped to your local printer from the most economical source. The dealership sends the specs to the printer and has it locally delivered. Your old bumper(assuming it was 3d printed as well), goes to a recycling center which recovers the raw materials for future printing.  Everything is one off made. Nothing sits in a warehouse. Shipping is all local. Things can be made to your exact spec.
1	4	Might be great for a long term Mars trip, but only if you had schematics for every item/tool you would need already built in. Also, it would need to be able to construct complex circuits/chips out of various materials including PCB, metal ect.
-	-	I think you'd have to put the whole mess inside a centrifuge.  It doesn't have to have high gravity, maybe .1g or so?  If your entire spacecraft is already rotating to help prevent muscle and bone atrophy in the crew, this problem will take care of itself.  
0	2	Yeah, I was thinking there's no way they printed that without fixing it up in the software... that would be a crazy accurate 3D sensor.
-	-	The printer is probably much more energy efficient, it's really not radically different from a normal inkjet printer, it doesn't cut anything, it prints. Melting metal takes a lot of energy. Modern lathes are very powerful machines that take the appropriate amount of energy to work, and chip cutting is always wasteful, depending on the engineering of the part making process. Apart from that, you would reduce the energy requirements by minimizing the transport of materials and finished parts, you would not have to produce a large number of anything to have it shipped cheaper.
-	-	Or, you can just phone home and someone on Earth can transmit the specs to you at need.  
-	-	The Diamond age is creeping closer.... 
0	6	the real test...if I hit "cancel job" will it stop fucking printing? If so *then* I'll be impressed
-	-	They talked about using the 3d printer in space.  I guess you would need to put it in a centrifuge  or something because I can't imagine a powder 3d printer would work too well in zero g.
0	1	I want to punch that host in the face
1	6	So, did the scanner image the inside of the original as well?  I'm curious how it did the moving parts, since a good bit of that would be impossible to view from the outside.
1	4	There is lots of bullshit in that video. First, they fake the scanning process, (actual wrench is different) then the end result is very fragile in practice. Currently these printers are good only for prototyping.   This does not mean that 3d printing is not fairly advanced already. There are 3d printers that print parts from titanium. It can be used for making titanium implants etc.  Joint Strike Fighter will use parts made with it. Rolls Royce If developing the technology to make it accurate enough to manufacture parts for jet engines. 
-	-	That's [not the same wrench model](http://i.imgur.com/eVT1B.jpg)...
-	6	Did that guy just totally pirate a wrench?
-	-	We have one of those 3D printers (seen in the background at 1:10) at work, but I still haven't seen anything printed on that particular machine.
0	2	It's an exceedinly wasteful way to make a wrench.
-	-	we had those scanners for a presentation in our company a few weeks ago. they're pretty fast and accurate but they can't do magic. cost is about 70.000â‚¬. 3d printer not included :)
-	-	Something tells me that powder would perform a little differently in zero-gravity type situations (such as the "lose your tool in space" scenario given.)
1	4	I saw this on Stargate SG1 and it has to do with these robot people who live in the stars.  It's gonna be *fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine*
-	-	mind=blown
1	6	No -- they left out the portion where they touched everything up in their modeling software.
	I was wondering how they could scan the insides of the wrench with something that only looked at the outside. Also, did the rotating screw in the printed wrench look a bit thicker and more crude than the original's, or was it just my imagination?
-	-	You wouldn't download a wrench.
-	-	Check [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12664422) out, EADS actually printed an entire bicycle in one of their new FDM's. This even includes printed bearings.
0	1	Good eye. Now I'm a little disappointed. Damn you technology, progress faster! I want none of this overeager promotional BS.
0	2	Yeah, they faked the details of it.  1) There is no way they got the internal workings of the wrench with their scanner. The parts inside where the "dial" drives the 'tooth' bit.  2) They used a model of a wrench built in AutoCAD or similar software

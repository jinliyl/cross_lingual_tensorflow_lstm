0	5	At least with Windows, Linux, and OSX you can still do work without access to the internet. And I don't think I'll be able to live without all my music, videos, and photos sitting on my hard drive. The cloud is just not big enough/I don't want to have to pay for storage space.
1	7	&gt;I can tell you as someone who uses ChromeOS in a corporate environment - it's just great, it just always works. I don't have to worry about it going down, I don't have to worry about loosing it, I can even leave it on a plane and not worry about it.   This would have been great as an alternative to Windows XP - when it was released.  And not mentioning what you're going to do when connectivity is missing (which, even in a city, happens in lots and lots of place) does not make the issue go away.

0	1	And it locks up like a bitch 30% more than Firefox 5. Fact. 
0	2	These jokes about Chrome and Firefox's version numbers are getting old.  Yes, it's silly that Chrome and Firefox release a new major version number every 6 weeks. I agree.  But there are much more interesting things to talk about in the new versions of both of those browsers, than the version numbers. 
1	4	But Firefox 747 will be here soon! With more turbines to make it go 4x as fast!
0	2	They're just numbers, why is there so much bitching about it?
0	4	hahahah I think they skipped a few numbers.
-	-	...which is actually Firefox 4.0.5.
1	6	FF8 is 60% more than FF5, but only 20% faster? Come on mozilla.
0	1	And it locks up like a bitch 30% more than Firefox 5. Fact. 
-	-	They'll stop at IE Version + 1
-	-	They want more cakes from microsoft.
-	-	I'm just going to wait for Firefox 347 next month.
1	6	Did I miss something what happened to 6 and 7? Or are they developing 3 versions forward and we have to wait 3 more versions for FF to get good?
-	-	Firefox still has some ways to go before I consider it replacing Chrome as my default browser.
0	2	iirc, Adblock Plus is out for Chrome now which proactively blocks ads from loading in the first place.  My gripes with Chrome/ium:  * They're not as configurable as Firefox: I like the address bar to select itself on click (in Linux, where this isn't default behavior on most browsers). In Firefox I can edit about:config, in Chrome there's no way. * I don't like how Chrome applies a yellow background to text boxes that it has saved passwords for (at least with the Google Toolbar for Firefox, you could disable this behavior; in Chrome you can't do anything about it). Only workaround is for the web designers themselves to override Chrome's style with `!important` in the CSS.
0	2	Applications that have memory fragmentation and inefficient caching are inefficient. Performance in terms of speed actually depends on both layout and size. 
-	-	Well, they haven't even remotely fixed it yet.  After opening/closing 20+ windows or tabs, it's rocking 500+ MB in memory and gets noticeably slower.  And it just climbs from there.
-	-	Microsoft might just be ballsy enough to call the next one IE-X.
1	4	This is a fascinating, original argument. So are CPU cycles, power, hard drive space and GPU cycles.   There exists a term that is spelled something like "efficient" and its what programs should be and why this is an issue.
0	6	Wait...this article is on Firefox 8, we're currently on 5. But 7 does what? What the fuck happened to their versioning? Why is it so arbitrary?
0	6	I thought this was a joke. Seriously. I waited for the punchline.
0	2	&gt; But there are much more interesting things to talk about in the new versions of both of those browsers, than the version numbers.  Except when a version number change means you [end-of-life the previous one](http://mike.kaply.com/2011/06/23/understanding-the-corporate-impact/#comment-10493) and will no longer support it, weeks after release.  
1	6	Don't get me wrong, I don't particularly care either way.  I'm just wondering *why* there is such a sudden increase in the pace of integer releases.   Surely people who are keen on good web browsers wont be particularly swayed by a number difference?  
-	-	The furor is due to those numbers conveying information. Before version 5, the version numbering followed the convention used by most major software:  - major version increments (e.g. Firefox 2 to 3) indicated large shifts in architecture, functionality, etc., shifts that often required relearning parts of the interface or recoding of plugins - minor version increments (e.g. 4.1 to 4.2, etc.) indicated significant changes, but within the new paradigm/framework set by the major version number - build version increments (4.3.1 to 4.3.2) indicated small changes like bug fixes and cosmetic changes  Suddenly, with Firefox 5, it's unclear what the version numbers represent. Firefox 5 only came out 3 months after Firefox 4, so it's unlikely there was a huge architectural shift, but can you be sure? Now instead of getting that information by just glancing at the version number, you have to read through the release notes, as what used to represent the major version number now apparently represents only the next build. They've taken a perfectly meaningful version numbering convention and tossed it, causing confusion and not adding any discernible benefit. That is why people are up in arms about the new version numbering.  EDIT: And the downvotes are because of...? I'm happy to hear contrary points of view, but I'm not sure why people think this post does not add information to the discussion.
0	2	The numbering system doesn't matter.  What did the old system do that is so much better than this?  Version numbers in software usually don't mean much, its mostly arbitrary
0	2	That makes it impossible to every do 'breaking' updates. You need a way to let people know "Extension X works in FFY, but will break in FFZ'. Obviously, you try to minimize such breakages, but sometimes they are necessary. 
-	-	I thought Google doesn't track usage if you deselect the "Automatically send usage statistics and crash reports to Google" option in Under the Hood?
1	6	Google branding? The icons are different colors that's it right?   I'd argue running a browser that doesn't auto-update is less secure. At worst a vulnerability is out long enough for google to notice and patch it. If I have to be watching out for updates there's another delay. 
0	1	The old numbering system was far far better.  Mozilla seems to be going full retard with the numbering system.  What the fuck happened to FF6?
-	-	Then they should just get rid of the numbers entirely. 
-	-	FF6 is in QA, to be released soon.   The article is about a very recent update, where the developer knows his update is so new it won't be in FF6, or even in FF7, so hes just talking about FF8, which is probably 6+ months away. 
-	-	The alternative would probably had been to be 4.x forever (or just increase major version arbitrarily, like 4.9 -&gt; 5.0), as they've switched to more iterative development model. It would have scared people less, but no real difference.
-	-	And chrome has some codecs and such that chromium doesn't have, and an integrated pdf reader.
1	4	I see where you are coming from, but plugin compatibility does **not** need to be the basis for compatibility checking. In fact Mozilla will automatically scan the **contents** of addons on addons.mozilla.org to check for compatibility, that is, to check whether there are **actual** compatibility issues. That's much better than a version number check.  Second thing, even version numbers are not a solution here. Say Mozilla called Firefox 5 instead Firefox 4.1. Addons could still say they are only compatible with 4 and not 4.1. And in the other direction, they could say they are compatible with 4.x, but 4.1 **can** be incompatible with 4.0, just like Chrome 13 can be with Chrome 12. These rapid releases are **not** guaranteed to be compatible with each other. For that reason, automatic compatibility checking is the best solution, not version number checking.  Yes, there are problems with that approach too, and this is a time of changing from one way of doing things to another. So there are annoyances, I am with you there. But I don't think there is an obviously better way of doing things. 
0	2	I might get downvoted for this, but honestly, they'd rather work on the memory consumption that has driven me away from Firefox for so long, than working on speed for right now.
-	6	Do I still have to restart when I install or remove an extension?
0	2	Applications that don't use the maximum available memory are inefficient.
1		oh yes. just this morning i checked why the webbrowsing felt so slow and firefox had accumulated 850 MByte of memory usage. and i don't have any plugins except adblock, greasemonkey and the RES. i think somewhere in between firefox 2.? and 5 they had it right but now it's back again.
-	-	The article mentions that Firefox 7 will focus on lessening the memory footprint. Especially in long browsing sessions. 
-	-	Firefox: the only software where you risk skipping versions if you oversleep.
0	2	This confused me too.  I thought it was a joke satire article comparing a future version of firefox to a future version of Chrome.
-	-	I remember the original Mozilla took a few years to even reach version 1.0.
-	-	Chrome uses even more memory if you have a lot of tabs open.
1	4	Memory is there to be used, free memory is a waste of money
-	-	maybe RTFA
-	-	Try the newest version, 5.0, and see how it works. For me 5.0 was significantly lower in memory usage than 4.0, 6.0, or 7.0.
1	6	[Adblock already blocks downloads](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom) and has for some time. The only major addon that I've found doesn't work properly on Chrome is NoScript.  And why would I use Chromium that I have to build myself? What advantages does it offer for the huge increase in inconvenience? 
1	4	I like the syncing with my Google account. I've been using gmail for years now, and Chrome since it came out 2 years ago, so it's difficult to go back. I do use FF occasionally, but the web apps/extensions, and syncing is just better. I know that FF has more extensions, but it is missing one crucial one that Chrome has. Can't live without it.
0	2	&gt; Until they get AdBlock for Chrome to proactively block ads (and thus save bandwidth/reduce exposure to malware) rather than retroactively removing them  Done some time ago. The capability to do so was added to WebKit for Safari extensions, and adopted by Chrome.
1	4	Idk, but when it went from 4 to 5 it broke.  I'll download that when I get home though.
-	-	I see some blogposts and such about both Chrome and Firefox when they release a new version. Pretty much the same.  For example, here's an article about Chrome 10, mentioning the version number specifically,  http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/03/08/2043244/Google-Releases-Stable-Version-of-Chrome-10  Neither Google nor Mozilla care much about the version number anymore (except in bug reports, where it is useful), but they can't control bloggers from using it. 
1	4	I see news stories about Chrome and stories about Firefox. They usually mention the version number. That's not Google and Mozilla to blame though.
1	6	That's fine. Who wants to run a year old browser?   
1	4	They have set milestones that I can't find quickly right now, sort of braindead at the moment.   Don't quote me exactly on this, but essentially 5 was an enhancement to get a bunch of CSS3/HTML5 features up to snuff, 6 is focused on performance (I believe), 7 is lowering memory usage, 8 is more speed.   Basically they are still doing more than minor fixes but instead of devoting months if not years of wrapping a ton of features into one they are setting very focused goals and trying to speed up the progression of web as we know it. Rapid release schedules should make it easier enforce requirements to update and I for one look forward to it.  Besides Microsoft is more or less on board too, with a semi rapid release cycle of their own. You can already download platform previews of IE10 and soon enough tell IE8 users they are two versions behind and should consider updating,
-	-	Thunderbird jumped from 3.1.1 to 5.0 ;)
1	4	&gt; Suddenly, with Firefox 5, it's unclear what the version numbers represent.   That is sort of the point with Chrome and Firefox now. Version numbers represent **nothing** with those two browsers. A version is released every 6 weeks, no matter if it happens to contain what used to justify a major version number, or not.  I understand if you are used to other version numbering schemes, this seems odd. But it should seem odd for just a short time, then you ignore it, I think? 
0	2	I love the way they are doing a release that adds fancy new HTML tags before they are doing the release that fixs the problems that everyone wants fixed. Between that, the silly new versioning and whatever happened between 4 and 5 I'm beginning to dislike Mozilla as much as they clearly dislike web developers. 
0	2	Firefox is the new IE and this version numbering is beyond retarded, just because Chrome had retarded version numbering doesn't mean Firefox should
0	6	They are working on something to get around this. Most addons seem to work fine. Right now, all addons require the dev to test with new versions and submit that they are working.  I know they want to try and change this due to the rapid release schedule. I don't know the full details but I've just started playing with something new - Addon Compatibility Reporter. Allows the community to submit feedback on what addons may or may not work with new versions of firefox.
-	-	* Five weeks from tomorrow 6 will go stable 7 will go to beta 8 will go to aurora  9 will be the new nightly  *  11 weeks 7 will be stable 8 will be in beta 9 in aurora 10 in nightly  * 17 weeks 8 will be stable 9 will be in beta 10 in aurora 11 in nightly   * 17 weeks until 8 goes stable. there are 4 trains nightly, aurora, beta stable. each cycle is 6 weeks 
-	-	It is. Being against automatic updates because they are a security hole is a ridiculous notion from people who grew up with system that were not connected to a network.
0	2	Just sounds like developers throwing their toys out of the pram and being cunts about versioning for no reason.
-	-	More releases = more rapid change, for good *and* ill. It's one thing to have your addons break every year, it's another to have some of them break every 2 months.
0	2	Then only increase the major version number when there are breaking changes! This really isn't that hard, it's a system plenty of software uses.  And don't tell me there are breaking changes every release. If your software breaks stuff every release, you need to take a serious look at its interoperability. You should be able to save up your breaking changes from several projects and release them all at once.
0	1	That's why the frequency of releases sucks, because no matter how well-intentioned, they run the risk of creating a spectrum of version-based bugs. Ironically, the thing that suffers most is the addon ecosystem, which is arguably FF's biggest selling point.  I agree with dead-reckoner, if your stuff is so solid you can rev it every two months, then drop the version number. Firefox 28 just sounds silly.
0	1	Ugh, gross. If you're going to do this just use the build numbers and release them whenever the fuck you feel like it. Yay, Firefox 43817!
0	6	Firefox 7 leaves Chicago for New York at 50mph. Two hours later, Firefox 8 departs from New York to Chicago at 65mph. How long until my plugins start updating so I can use something newer than 3.6?
-	-	I'm still using FF3
0	1	Dammit I just want my google toolbar extension to work again!
0	1	Chrome 14, what the hell!  This is getting ridiculous.
-	-	i am hoping for better memory consumption. 
0	1	How the fuck did we get to 8?
0	6	Really? And the the UI still written in JavaScript?
0	6	Wait. What happened to FF 6 and 7? I just upgraded to 4
0	2	I'm going to move away from firefox because of these retarded version changes. 1-2-3 were normal. 4-5-6-7-8 are just stupid.
-	-	Yeah FFS, divide it by 10 and maybe we'd have a realistic representation of where Chrome is right now.
0	2	Except 1 thing. Every time a new FF version comes out there's 100 different articles released to the web about what's so wonderfully great about this next version number. I must be blind because I don't see Chrome doing anything like this. In fact I actually had to google their version number earlier today because I had no clue what they were on. I figured Chrome was on like version 2 or 3. So they have gone up to preview version 14 without me seeing one article about it.
0	6	What's the problem exactly?  Note that the compatibility system (as in, "compatible with FF 2.0-3.x") doesn't work any more; you have to install [this extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/add-on-compatibility-reporter/?src=api) to disable that system (and thus enable all your extensions).
0	3	watch out for Kefka
1	4	For me it's the opposite, Chrome still has a long way to go before I consider switching from Firefox.   Until they get AdBlock for Chrome to proactively block ads (and thus save bandwidth/reduce exposure to malware) rather than retroactively removing them, I'm sticking with FF.   Additionally, the difference in rendering/startup speed isn't as night and day as it used to be when it was FF 3.5 vs Chrome.   And honestly, if you're using Chrome, there is really no reason why you shouldn't use Chromium instead.
-	-	FF5 is already out.
1	4	This is definitely a potential problem. Devs now have several Chrome versions and several Firefox versions, because of those two browsers' fast release schedule. There are indeed more versions to test.  However, there are small differences between those versions, so there should be fewer problems. I agree that this still adds work for web devs, but not as much as it might seem. 
-	-	It's a trickle-down development system, so the problem you've identified with traditional breakage in major version numbers is not such a big deal anymore.
-	-	You missed that they switched their development cycle to be more like Chrome's.  Yes, they develop several versions ahead, just like Chrome which currently has 3 different versions (14 in canary and dev, 13 in beta, 12 in release) Firefox currently has 8 in Nightly, 7 in Aurora, 6 in Beta, and 5 in Release.  
-	-	Moz is open enough to get core problems out of the way before they hit stable I'd say. The whole philosophy they have is standards standards standard.   IE on the other hand is supposed to work just well enough to work so the devs get maximum time on lock-in features like woah look at our hardware acceleration.
-	6	These super-frequent integer iterations of firefox seem utterly crazy to me.   Why on earth are they calling it FF8? Is it because Chrome is at such an absurd version number now?
0	6	I wonder about the consequences for web devs. Testing multiple versions of browsers is already a pain.
0	6	What!?!?! I just upgraded to FF4!
-	-	That might have to do with the Gecko 5 engine, whatever that means...
-	-	I was actually testing the multiple versions of firefox when 4 was the Release build. 5.0(Beta) was very low memory usage compared to the other versions. 6.0(Aurora) was slightly higher on memory usage but ran faster on the sunspider javascript test. 7.0(Nightly) was about the same on the javascript benchmark as 5.0, except twice the memory usage. I tossed this up to un-optimized code.  So your milestones seem about right for what I was seeing except for nightly, but this was shortly after the release of the new versioning system so it likely was still a work in progress.
-	-	It seems that most of the differences between the two are related to licenses or privacy. As far as advantages from an end-user convenience standpoint go, I'm not aware that there are any (though I'd welcome any enlightenment).   Lists of differences between Chrome and Chromium: [code.google.com](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/ChromiumBrowserVsGoogleChrome).  Also, you can download prebuilt binaries from [build.chromium.org](http://build.chromium.org/f/chromium/snapshots/)
1	4	Chromium has a fair few advantages:   (i) No usage tracking (or less, at least).  (ii) No google branding  (iii) Limits your damage from insecure autoupdates. 
1	4	Chrome and Firefox release a new version every 6 weeks.  Both of those has a stable version N, then N+1 is in beta, N+2 in alpha, and N+3 in development.  It does seem odd and arbitrary at first, but it's actually well thought out and Google and Mozilla made a good choice to do this I think.
1	7	Please file a bug about this, Firefox is an open source project and it can only succeed with our help. I would file a bug myself about it, but I just tried what you said (open over 20 tabs), and did not get that problem. So maybe it is the websites you visited, or your addons.  More specifically, please go to bugzilla.mozilla.org and file a bug there with detailed steps to reproduce your problems. In particular, please paste the output of about:memory when you think too much memory is being used - this contains a lot of info that will help the Firefox devs fix your problem. Also please mention the addons and plugins you have, your OS, etc.  Thanks! 
1	6	&gt; I'm just wondering why there is such a sudden increase in the pace of integer releases.  The [Singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) is near! Repent, unbelievers!
-	-	Because they left 3.5 as the public release for like 2 years, because they didn't think they had 'enough' for FF4. After doing that, they decided they wanted to have fast releases. Every month or two if possible, not because 'oooh numbers', but to get people the new good code asap. It requires some sort of numbering system, and 3.6, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 is more confusing than just FF4 FF5 FF6 FF7. 
-	6	how is this not going full retard?
1	8	I care about the version number because it's the basis for plugin compatibility checking.  You can have two of these three things:  * crazy version numbers * plugin compatibility based on version numbers * users that upgrade when you release a new version  but you can't have all three.

1	8	&gt;The magnitude of this crime affected everyone from high ranking  &gt;members of the White House staff to the average American citizen     So typical... unless they are referring to smell.  
1	4	&gt;FBI Newark special agent Michael Ward said. "It's important to note that it wasn't just the hacking itself that was criminal, but what could potentially occur utilizing the pilfered information."  A little worry-some that the evaluation of what could possibly happen can point to it being criminal. In the process of a white hat that finds a security hole and informs the organization for it to be fixed would not be able to go into the grey realm and release that information due to lack of resolution.  Would they be seen as committing a criminal act due to what potentially could occur?

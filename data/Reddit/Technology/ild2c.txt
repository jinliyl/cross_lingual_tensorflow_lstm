-	-	That's called a work-around.
-	-	Calling me a fanboy for saying iTunes is a valid form of digital distribution is not only idiotic, it's wrong. I have _never_ purchased anything from iTunes, and I don't even have it installed on my Win7 desktop. I have a Macbook Pro, but I have not purchased anything through either iTunes or the Mac App Store.   Digital distribution is a great way for smaller devs and musicians to get their product out. That's whats so great about Steam, the App Store, iTunes, the Android Market and all the other digital distribution services - it allows the little guys (like my friend) to get some notoriety and sell some of their product.   iTunes HAS assisted many small labels and bands with no labels. Many bands now have been able to forego labels or go with small, indie labels and sell their products through iTunes.   The mp3 price has gone up...if you purchase music. I don't, so I don't really care. But that DOES NOT change the fact that digital distribution HELPS THE LITTLE GUY in ways you probably cannot fathom, seeing as your original statement included 'The only thing Apple has done regarding music is help prop up a dying industry bloated on its own greed.' Totally false.   The musical industry isn't dying, it's thriving. And it's digital distribution that's helping it.
-	-	Name some of these bands that Apple is helping.
-	-	One example: have you ever heard of All Time Low? I don't like their music, but I grew up with the guys - a lot of their revenue from their early days was from iTunes. My roommates brother has a small band and he's sold several dozen songs on iTunes. Though Amazon has (imo) a better service, iTunes is more widespread. If you want notoriety you have to go where the public is.   I don't support iTunes or a lot of digital distribution services (for the reason you said - they're so expensive) but they're _good_ for the industry. Look at steam and the indie devs on there...would Super Meat Boy or Amnesia have made anywhere near the amount of money they did if Steam didn't exist?   Just some food for thought: http://musically.com/blog/2011/03/23/itunes-spotify-and-amazon-dominate-indie-label-revenues/
-	-	13,920 US jobs, according to the article.  27,250 Non-US.   This of course does not include jobs created by other companies trying to compete with Apple (Google, Microsoft, RIM, Palm, etc...)  It seems to me that quite a bit of jobs have been created.
-	-	No, Steve was already alive
1	4	I would say yes. The iPod, especially the iPod touch, brought mobile media to the masses. Apps, podcasts, radiocasts, etc, grew in popularity due in part to the success of the iPod. The App store generates lots of revenue for developers and iTunes makes the distribution of music and video so much easier. Making musicians less dependent on record labels. It's been big. Apple may not have created technology, but they certainly have made it ubiquitous.
0	2	You know why I can't take this article seriously?  It doesn't contain the words "intellectual property" or "content".  While the production of the device certainly creates a disproportionate number of overseas jobs the production of the content we put on it certainly creates jobs in the US.  
1	4	didn't read, but Apply Boomed big time afte the iPod, and they hire waayyy more people now than before the iPod
1	6	so "jobs" at apple store for idiots, who say: "may i help you" are the jobs created by ipod?
-	-	So it's a no then, because it's just a platform.
1	4	There are at least 5 more US located Apple jobs. Those people are now flying back and forth to sweatshops in China to make sure the rights parts can be made there. So Yes. More jobs.
-	-	"less dependent on record labels"  Apple doesn't allow anybody to publish an album on their iTunes store, and sure as hell doesn't put you on the front page for free.  Any illusion that they've assisted musicians is precisely that.  Furthermore, look at the pricing.  Ever since the recording industry got its way, mp3 prices have gone _up_ thanks to their tiered system of charging more for popular music.  The only thing Apple has done regarding music is help prop up a dying industry bloated on its own greed.
-	-	Did you even read the article?  Here's another one for you to not read: http://curiouscapitalist.blogs.time.com/2011/01/11/is-the-iphone-bad-for-the-american-economy/
0	2	The article is incomplete.  It talks about a content delivery system without talking about content.  
-	-	The USA economy is based on content and IP so it is absolutely valid even if there is no direct link to jobs, even if they decided to build ipods in The States, people wouldn't want to do it at a reasonable and competitive hourly rate, and not as many people would buy the ipod because it would have been far too expensive.
-	-	yes, anybody can put their music on iTunes. doesn't mean that ppl are going to buy it tho. 
-	-	Not commenting on the article, just an answer to the question that's part of the headline.
-	-	Ever heard of CDBaby? Literally anyone can add their music to iTunes.
0	2	I have a couple musician friends that REALLY would like to disagree with you. They've gotten their music out to the masses in a way that they couldn't have before. They've sold thousands of their songs (both combined) and they've made money they would not have made otherwise. iTunes, and digital distibution in general, is great for the industry.  You should probably learn the facts instead of going on an 'Apple is evil' tangent.
-	-	that's the consumer choice. no longer a distribution issue.
-	-	Apple has, not only through iTunes, made it easier to sell music, but also to create it with Garageband. Musicians don't necessarily need a recording studio anymore to create cds, especially for digital distribution. And of course they won't just put you on the front page, but with a little discovery you can find those artists who aren't with a record label. I wish iTunes had the same mixview features as Zune, great for music discovery.
-	-	I'm not saying anything against digital distribution in whole.  I'm saying that the belief that Apple's brand of DD has assisted bands off major labels (as the original comment suggests) is false.  And frak off for assuming this has anything to do with HURR APPLE IS EVIL when I own an iPod Classic and an iPhone 4.  Find something else to do, fanboy.
0	4	Anybody can put their music on iTunes with a work-around that requires an intermediary agent.  That's not the same thing.  And fair enough, but when Apple pushes the albums sold by the major labels with the big money which albums do you think people are going to buy?  Indie bands never had trouble receiving equal shelf space in record stores, so this is a phenomenon mostly associated with digital distribution and the fact that the company controlling the means also controls what people are largely exposed to.

1	4	Yeah, it sounds like it allows you to ethnically cleanse your profile or something.  Or to commit war crimes on the annoying people who write inane shit on your wall.
-	-	if you want an invite, pm me with your email
0	6	I think you're asking the wrong guy, I don't work for Google. You should try their support line, however I highly doubt they have a "Blowjob Assistance department."
-	-	Google+ is no different. Privacy etc...
-	-	http://www.technologyreview.com/printer_friendly_article.aspx?id=38006
-	-	Once you hide their posts, along with other posts from the same types of people you, you have to go to each one of their pages and see what they have posted.  with google+ you can throw all of those non friends into a group and if you want to see what all of them are doing/their posts, click on that circle.  google did an amazing thing of letting the user pick what kind of feeds they want to see at that certain time.
1	6	&gt;How is Google+ free of privacy worries? It still allows you to post things publicly. People will still do it.  Everytime you post something, you choose which group you want to share the post with. Each individual group has its own icon and it's has easy as click the X to remove that group. Sharing a post isn't public by default, it's sharing to the last group you've entered.  It's much, much easier to NOT share a post with everyone than with Facebook.
-	-	When people talk about privacy issues, they don't often point out public posting. Now if they made it difficult to make it non-public, it's something of a concern. But the ability to post publicly is expected to be there, it needs to be there, and it's incredibly easy to not post things publicly. You can't blame Google+ for when people screw up and post stuff in the public view that they shouldn't. People have concerns about Facebook because they have major flaws created by apps (thankfully Google+ is free of those. Talk about unnecessary and a major security concern) and because they make it as difficult as possible to hide things and to know who sees what. As long as you have your circles organized correctly, you can make sure only the people you want to see something will see it, especially if you block re-sharing which takes two seconds. Nobody is asking Google to try to warn you, "Hey, you look to be posting angry comments about your ex-girlfriend while you're drunk. Are you sure this should be posted to the public?" because that's unreasonable to ask of Google to include that. There's a reason messages like those in Gmail are considered "going above and beyond".  Except blocking people on Facebook means you can't see each other. For a lot of people, their choice is to add someone as a friend or be impolite and tell them "no". It's a very binary system. Either you're in or you're out, and it would be rude to not include some people but do include others. Most people consider it rude, so they won't do it. There's social expectations and not adding someone as a friend is perceived as a hostile action.  That's a minor correction. The point still stands: You can't tell if what circle you're on. For all you know it's the "Ignore These People" circle. Or maybe you're just a "Friend" and not a "Close Friend". Knowing they added you into one of their circles is their way of saying the other person has acknowledged your existence in some way, but they don't need to constantly remind themselves you get to see everything they post.
-	-	You can do essentially the same thing with Facebook "Groups", it's just not as simple or intuitive.
0	2	I hate the links to facebook. I don't have facebook and hate it when I click a link to a private site that requires a login.
-	-	Back when I had facebook this crossed my mind more than a few times.
1	4	Someone just got -1'd!
-	-	I meant privacy concerns relative to One corporation, not privacy concerns related to your grandparents.  One company will end up owning your social network, that is a privacy concern. Whether it be Facebook or Google, its the same. 
0	2	And that's really your only choice, is to ignore them and hope they forget and go away. What if they meet up with you in person and "remind" you to add them, though? It's not a solution, it's just ignoring the problem.
-	-	I have a button that says I can send invites right now. it comes and goes. Just send me your email in a pm and I'll invite you.  edit:I'm leaving work at 6:00PM EDT, so if I get it by then, I'll send an invite. If I get it after I get home, I'll send one if the button is still available
-	-	Good luck with that trust, not trying to sound negative but any company can change. I also trust Google more than Facebook, but still it feels wrong to let them have all my information.   It means my work pays for Googles success. Using G+ or facebook means my content is used against me, every share I perform is another collection to Facebooks/G+s growing power over me, its not an equal relationship. 
1	4	Relevant [comic](http://www.pvponline.com/2011/07/07/plus-or-minus/)...  I guess it's a good thing they can't see.
1	4	&gt; You can see if someone has you in their circles, but you can't see which circle you're in  Hey, that's fine. I'll make a "random dickhead" circle, and avoid the awkwardness of managers and clients wanting to friend me. Sooo can't wait.
-	-	Facebook was never about privacy, it was always about sharing - everything. It was all awkward for us when our parents joined, and then even worse for some of us, when the grandparents joined...   G+ from the start just lets your organize all of this as it happens. I will never have to get another post from a 'friend' because something I said bothered them. 
-	-	&gt;  For a lot of people, their choice is to add someone as a friend or be impolite and tell them "no".  My wife has 100+ unanswered friend requests from people she don't want as friends, but feels would be impolite to deny. So they stay in the "new friend requests" queue.
1	4	I can't wait. I've had it with Facebook on so many levels.
-	-	I want to balkanize my social life, that's the appeal of Google+. Now, I can post idiotic memes to my internet circle, ridiculous Starcraft fanboy stuff to that circle, and normal status update stuff to my normal circles, and I can have my fun being a nerd without being 'that guy'.
1	4	That's awesome, the only girls I ever met from Bulgaria were smokin' hot.  
-	-	by not making me click on a "next page" button like this webpage does
0	1	Via email? Shit.
0	1	This article is wrong and misleading about a lot of shit.  &gt; It's not just that Google+ has 10-person video hangouts, or that Google+ is magically free of privacy worries.  How is Google+ free of privacy worries? It still allows you to post things publicly. People will still do it.  &gt; Google has created the opportunity for Facebook-weary people to perform what one called "a reset on Facebook," allowing them to escape from Facebook members they've friended over the years but don't really want to interact withâ€”and can't quite bring themselves to defriend.   You can block people on Facebook. I have &gt; 50% of my "friends" blocks and don't interact with them at all.  &gt; But you'll never be put in the awkward situation of receiving a friend request from someone you don't really want to be Google+ friends with. Nor will you have to face the awkward decision of whether or not to defriend a former confidant with whom you've fallen out. Just remove them from your circles, which are never revealed to other users.  You can see if someone has you in their circles, but you can't see which circle you're in. 
-	-	This presentation is spot on:  http://www.slideshare.net/padday/the-real-life-social-network-v2
1	6	Balkanize your social life -- are we talking bad haircuts and severe vowel shortages? 
-	-	I didn't know what "balkanize" meant, and immediately assumed this was an article on how Google+ will turn all my friends into [Balki Bartokomous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balki_Bartokomous).
1	4	&gt; But you'll never be put in the awkward situation of receiving a friend request from someone you don't really want to be Google+ friends with  This!! I want this!! For some reason my worst clients and most prickish managers always want to be Facebook friends. What is that shit?
1	4	I trust Google one hell of a lot more than Facebook. I can't escape the idea that Zuckerberg would through his grandmother under a bus for a buck. Plus Google I think are better engineers in general.
1	6	Are the invites working now? Didn't they close off the service to new users?
-	6	what is the "social life"?
1	4	Or, in other words:  &gt;Google+, so no you can be excluded from social cirlces online as well as in real life!
0	2	&gt; I want to balkanize my social life  This, 1000 times, this. I am sick of getting invites from random people, or people I haven't seen in like 12 years. I hate all the facebook app bullshit I get and all those social invites that I never paid any damned attention to.  I want a social network that actually integrates with my social life. Google+ is already in my email and on youtube, sharing is easy and a majority of my friends already have a google email address.  Google also hasn't censored any of my posts, facebook did this to me a few times, either taking it down or just downright denying me the ability to post or even send it as a private message. Most importantly Google+ actually allows me to control the information i want to see and what I want people to see, instead of subjecting their users to massive amounts of data vomit that we need to manually sort through we can look at what we want to and that's it... Amazing...
-	-	This would explain why there are so few muslims in my circles....   I know...I'd be going to Hell if I believed in it.
1	4	My real-life social life is 'balkanized' because that's the way I like it. I'm willing to bet that most people are similar. I don't know anybody who goes to the strip club with their mom or to the bake sale with their drinking buddies.
-	-	Indeed. Facebook's "let's throw everyone in the same bucket and let the users sort the mess out" was unacceptable to me. My impressions on The Human Centipede (in English), asking a friend when he was coming to Greece (in French) and wishing my sister happy birthday (in Greek) have no business being in the same place. I literally gave up on Facebook after a week, since my wall had become a way to difficult to manage mess of posts in multiple languages, links to external sites and stupid game invites.
1	6	Is it possible to have overlap between different social circles?  For example, if person #1 is in circle A and B, but person #2 is in circle B and C.  If I want to share a link to circle A, but not C, would it be easy to pull this off?
1	4	THIS!  Prior to Google+, there would be so many times I would find an awesome geek link but wouldn't share to FB because, well, you know..  This brings more balance to everything. 
1	4	Totally agree.  It's one of the reasons I don't use facebook.  I don't want to mix my work with my family.
1	4	Exactly. I don't go to the movies with my colleagues. I don't drink booze with my customers. I don't talk operating systems and networks to my family. Balkanization is precisely what we want.
1	4	I clicked through the whole thing.  Everything he says makes sense, once you see it, it becomes blatant.  I liked it.
-	-	it's also over a year old, and the UX engineer who wrote it at google now works for facebook.
-	-	No it's definitely a solution because that's exactly what I've done...   Now, the new solution is just to be on G+. 
1	4	Yes, it is. For example, I have several people from my 'friends' circle also in my 'internet' circle and my 'esports' circle, and it seems to be fine with that. 
-	-	&gt;because, well, you know..  A lack of confidence in who you really are? Not said in an accusatory tone. I feel ya, brother (if the preceding question hit the mark, of course).
1	6	OMG, Google, put your cock in my mouth.
-	6	Isn't that what it means?
-	-	Up until they reorganize stuff and you have to redo it. 
-	-	To balkanize means to divide something and then to make those divided parts hostile to each other or simply to divide something into many small parts. The term comes from the name of Balkan peninsula. As a someone who lives there I find the term mildly offensive.
0	2	&gt; It's not a solution, it's just ignoring the problem  Yep. A client I couldn't stand sent me a friend request, and reminded me of it THAT DAY in a separate email. While I'd love to say "oh god, I can't stand you, i just want your business", it's less hassle to just cave.  Being able to accept friends without consequence will revolutionize my networking. Right now, I really have to filter what I put on FB.

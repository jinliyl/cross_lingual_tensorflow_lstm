0	2	&gt;The shutter noise on a digital camera is just one example of a sound entirely fabricated to make a modern gadget imitate older technology.    Dammit, now I want a volume knob or mute button on my 40D.
-	-	I associate the iconic sound of Harley Davidsons with insufferable assholes.  And it makes me laugh when I remember the time I was standing outside a bar with a bunch of people and somebody on a Harley opened the throttle to impress us, then immediately lost control of the bike. 
0	2   	Jesus, what a fluff piece that was. Really, BBC guy, people don't use floppies any more? And it's still used as an iconic image to signify saving? *You don't say.*  Also, camera phones don't have a real shutter. :O
0	2	Why is it legal to do this, companies ripping people off seems to be accepted more often than not, making something that imitates quality should be looked down on.

0	2	Their line is "loud bikes save lives" but the sound emanates most loudly from BEHIND the bike. Perhaps if they had a forward facing exhaust, preferably near the rider's face, it would make everyone happy. 
-	-	That's on digital compacts. Your 40D actually has mechanical parts that clunk and make the sound. One some D-SLRs you do get a quiet function where it flips the mirror more gently, I think it's so you don't scare away birds/animals which a big CLA-CHUNK noise
-	-	That's okay because you can change it to a duck sound or something else really annoying.
1	4	Agreed.
0	2	Of course, loud bikes only save lives if they have a macho bass rumble. If bikes were required to play a pleasant glockenspiel tune like that of an ice cream truck we'd find volume far less popular.  This is odd because the noises motorcyclists like are the very worst noises for knowing where an engine is. Deep bass is hard to localize, echoes strangely and is sufficiently disconcerting that car drivers sometimes panic, wondering which side a bike is coming up from.  You can make yourself believe almost anything, I suppose.

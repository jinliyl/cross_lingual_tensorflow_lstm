1	4	I agree with you to an extent but even if the company is in another industry Apple still needs to protect the name. If app store started becoming synonymous with, say, a chain of supermarkets then Appke would really lose out. Instead of people associating App Store with Apple theyd be associating it with that supermarket chain instead. 
1	8	I'm giving an example. It doesn't matter if they did or didn't I'm trying to give an example that the Apple-haters may feel more sympathetic to.
-	-	Except they did: [Windows Marketplace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Marketplace).
-	-	I see. It's just kind of dumb IMO but I don't see any real faults.
1	6	well then wouldn't that automatically throw out any arguments against an "app(lication) store"?
0	4	Their business model does not rely on this term but a big money maker is their app store. They have to go up against any perceived infringements on their property (whether they think they will win or not) so anyone else thinking to borrow a term Apple uses will think twice.   And this is not just Apple its standard business practices. You really think Apple would rather do this than focus on making more money? They gain nothing from this and lose money. 
0	6	So by your argument, anyone who makes soft drinks should be allowed to call their drinks "Pepsi"?
0	5	I agree. App Store is too general to be protected. I'm sure Apple thinks so as well...they still have to attempt to protect their property. If they rolled over and let things like this happen it would get much worse for them.
0	2	Applications were called "apps" about 5 minutes after programs became "applications". That no one wanted to use the term "app store" is as irrelevant as the fact that no one wanted to use the term "mp3 store".   
1	4	LOL, are you serious or being sarcastic? Some of us who have been around the industry have seen the word "apps" well before the usage by Apple.  
-	-	I think it could already be argued that "app store" is a generic name and therefore nobody can own a trademark on it
-	-	Apple believes that "App Store" is not a name describing all software stores, but is a specific name for the Apple App Store. I guess we're going to see if that's true based on upcoming legal proceedings. 
0	1	The movement may get big and I hope it does.  And this is a stupid suit Apple should lose.  All that said, Getjar sucks.
0	2	For all of you nitpicking whether Apple is right, or whatever, you can't argue with the TLDR;  Big companies are asserting rights under the USPTO that they *do not have* simply because of how large they are and how inconvenient it is for the little guys to respond appropriately.  Microsoft gets 18000 patents, which allows them to just wave them in the general direction of a sizable codebase for money.  Apple spams the USPTO for a trademark, which it is not granted, several times, which it now asserts it had all along. For an abbreviation! That's not a product name!  It's all the same, and it is creating too many barriers to entry in the marketing and distribution of free software and platforms.
0	1	Fuck you and your vague title
1	8	So... GetJar admit that they've been in operation since *before* the App Store but after the App Store became popular, they renamed their store to match it's name?  That sounds exactly like copying someone else in order to steal some of their marketing effort.  I'd like to support them more in this effort but they don't exactly sound above reproach.
0	1	I like Apple, but they are being WAY too greedy as of late. Fuck everything about these C&amp;D and injunctions.
1	8	What many people don't understand is that Apple isn't the only company that does this...EVERY tech company does this. That's just how business works. You are forced to sue in instances like these not to be a bunch of assholes to everyone else but to try and protect your business.  Think about it...if another company (say, Windows) tried to name their online distribution service 'market' would Google stand idly by? No, they would sue to protect their name. Yes it might be generic enough (like app store) that it will be allowed but Google still has to sue to scare off other potential problems. You don't want 10 different companies naming their product the market or app store because then that word becomes too generic and loses it's specific meaning. People will no longer think of app store = apple and it will just be generic.  Don't let your dislike of a certain company preclude your ability to realize that this is just how business works...suing to protect your ip are an evil but necessary part of the business. Apple does NOT want to be burdened with litigation against these guys, Samsung, and any other company....but they have no choice. As a business you need to dedicate a percentage of your income to defending your intellectual property. It's not evil when Apple does it (or any other company) they just have no other choice.   With that said, I think Apple will lose. They probably know this, too...but they don't have any other choice but to defend their name.
-	-	Yes but this means later down the line, nobody else can use app store if it ever does get traction. That's the scary part.
-	-	According to this, it has already been shown to be not true at least twice.
-	-	i think part of their claim is 'app' is short for apple as in 'apple store' (wow semantic cessation on apple much?)
-	-	Yeah, that's why the USPTO said "no" to apple's attempt to trademark it.
-	-	If your business model relies on exclusive rights to a generic technology term, then you need a new business model.  I don't need to 'accept' something just because it's prevalent behavior.
1	8	It won't get big. Apple will lose but it will be a pyrrhic victory for getjar and that in and of itself may prevent others from doing something similar to this.  
1	-	No, Google wouldn't.  They'd only take offense if it was named "Android Market."  The problem is that "App Store" is such a generic name, it could apply to any *store* that sells *applications*.  Apple was the first to name their store the "App Store," and they should go after people entering the same market that they are in, but to sue companies with unrelated products is not benefiting anyone (and actually hurting both with legal fees etc).
1	4	&gt;because then that word becomes too generic and loses it's specific meaning. People will no longer think of app store = apple and it will just be generic.  Good.
-	-	&gt;if another company (say, Windows) tried to name their online distribution service 'market'  But they didn't.
1	4	Why is it scary? No one wanted to use the name before Apple started. No one except Steve Jobs really called applications "apps" before the iPhone (with the exception of when using the phrase "killer app").  So, competitors will have to think up another name. Hardly terrifying stuff.
1	4	It can really go either way. There are plenty of businesses with names that are very much like the name of what they are, but they were able to protect their name (News International, for example). And Apple has invested quite a bit into marketing their App Store as "App Store". And I'm pretty sure they got there first.   Android has the Marketplace, Amazon has the Download Store. There are plenty of alternative names for an online software retailer. Those names don't seem scary. 
-	-	No, but any other drink manufacturer should be allowed to call the container a 'can'.
-	-	i neither care enough nor know enough to answer that sorry.
-	-	Yeah, Windows Marketplace. They didn't name it just Marketplace did they?

It would seem the weak point in the system isn't the artificial inflation of the currency itself, but massive expansion of the money supply by gaming the organizations that keep track of the demand for bitcoins, the supply of bitcoins, and therefore the price of bitcoins.

This would drive the price of apple stock way down, and people with real shares of apple would sell their shares also.  The hacker would then take advantage of this to buy a bunch of real apple shares for rock bottom prices, then flip them when the stock recovers for a profit.

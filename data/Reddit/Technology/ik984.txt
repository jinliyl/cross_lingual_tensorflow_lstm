0	2	The main problem with that is that Anon isn't shy about taking credit for what they do. They have their own set of morals and are proud of what they accomplish.
0	2	Welcome to America, where being a certifiable retard qualifies you for government work, but people who're actually interested in securing our democracy can't find a job even when they practically scream it on the interwebs, afterall the bribes wouldn't sit well with them.
-	-	This is a contractor of the FBI
0	2	I submitted the idea that government would "hack" themselves in order to pin the crime on anonymous and push censorship bills months ago.
-	-	You're almost correct, you just forgot that inside many Americans (only male, though) are pedophiles and rapists, too.
-	-	dunno if it's relevant, but, reminds me of a quote from Battlestar Galactica:  There's a reason you separate military and the police. One fights the enemies of the state, the other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes both, then the enemies of the state tend to become the people.
-	-	Still too much TV mythology. HBGary is typical of the competence level. NSA just happens to employ a lot of mathematics PhDs. It does not make them effective at law enforcement.
-	-	EWD? Economic Workforce Development?
0	6	Why bother with engineering when familiar office products will suffice?
0	2	wank wank about how much higher than your's my IQ is... &amp; it is... comment about how I didn't say it qualified you for all government work. bemoaning the fact it's quite plausible you can't even follow this reasoning.
-	-	Ummmm....[no](http://www.google.co.in/search?aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=define+conspiracy). Your thinking of a [conspiracy theory.](http://www.google.co.in/search?aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=define+conspiracy+theory).
-	-	It's in our cultural DNA really...  The founding fathers were a bunch of pot smoking, slave owning, tax dodging terrorists who shot from the tree line like cowards and flash-mobbed ships at night dressed as an easily vilified third party to destroy taxable cargo.   The typical anon conspiracy theorist that heeds the call to action is a "founding father" in miniature.  ...besides, a healthy distrust of "government" is absolutely a good thing.

-	-	I'm talking about the implications of the term, not the dictionary definition.
-	-	Class dismissed.
1	6	Isn't that how a lot of cowboy IT firms operate? Especially in education actually.
0	2	I don't know what you guys were arguing about (since it's deleted now), but this:  &gt;Welcome to America, where being a certifiable retard qualifies you for government work  Really frustrates the hell out of me.  My fiancee worked her ass off to earn 4 degrees (BA, BS, JD, &amp; MPP) so she could work for the US government because she knows she can actually make a difference where it counts.  What she has done for this country and for the environment would put you to shame.    There are idiots in private, corporate, non-profit *and* government - please be more respectful.  
-	-	[deleted]
1	4	Exactly!
-	-	When it comes to government, there is an endless supply of controversies.
0	2	As soon as the media finds the next suitable distraction for the American public, they cram it down their throats. This happens so often that people are overloaded with information/panic from the continuing crises, and forget things that happened just months before.
-	-	From the article - "Anonymous Said, "If you place any value on freedom, then stop working for the oligarchy and start working against it. Stop aiding the corporations and a government which uses unethical means to corner vast amounts of wealth and proceed to flagrantly abuse their power. Together, we have the power to change this world for the better."
-	-	Blackwater primarily does business with State, not Defense.
-	-	You really haven't been paying attention have you...  ...apparently inside every American there's a asymmetric terrorist trying to get out.   We have met the enemy and they are us.
0	6	why would the government hire firms to create fake online profiles ?
-	-	&lt;sings&gt; ...and bingo was his name-o 
0	6	What else would you expect from the lowest bidding contractor?
0	2	oh, so it's a conspiracy, not a conspiracy...
0	6	Were you being sarcastic just now, or was that a really bad typo?
-	-	They forced that guy to change his twitter picture to a cartoon.  I think that's all that came from it.
0	6	Contract'er? I hardly even know'er!
-	-	wat
-	-	More like leaving your doors and windows open while you're on vacation, then being shocked when there's animal poop all over the place.
0	6	Wait, the FBI uses... ACCESS Databases?!?  &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; 
-	-	IRC Federal is to the FBI what Blackwater is to our military.  
0	6	Whatever happened t the HB Gary controversy from a few months ago?
0	1	I like how all these important security type contractors DON'T SANITIZE THEIR FUCKING DATABASE QUERIES.   Is this the level of incompetence my taxes are funding ? The fuck...
0	3	Better hurry up and pass that interwebz kill switch -- or we might have more hackings -- very scary be afraid.   We might need a TSA for the internetz -- 
-	-	Contractor is spelled with an O, not an E.
0	2	I smell a conspiracy going on... 
-	-	**&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;**  
-	-	i hope this aint falseflag for intraweb clampdown
0	1	Fantastic, now they're a threat to national security. Just what they fucking needed.
0	2	It isn't a conspiracy:  The US government consistently and constantly conspires against its own citizens to fulfill and maintain the interests of our plutocracy.  It's simple truth.  
0	2	Oh. So the FBI just overpays someone to use Access for them. Got it.
0	6	If downvotes reflected reality I'd be in trouble. I'm a bit surprised there's such resistance to the idea that "conspiracy" is a loaded word.
0	1	To be fair, his original comment did say 'implies'.
-	-	hopes he wasn't too harsh. trying to be civil. it's just hard.
-	-	Nigga please. The FBI is not like on TV. They are just slightly better paid no-necks like the Barney Fifes in your local cop shop.
-	-	Just go with it, I think kite and bboy are right on this one.
-	-	-5 pts.    *See me after class.*
-	-	calls http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect on you lazily first try without seeing it in months after drinking two forties of fortified malt. such a shame you're lame. all points proven by retard. knows what fortified &amp; malt means.
0	2	What would you call and unhealthy distrust of government?
0	1	What the fuck are you trying to say?
-	-	[deleted]
0	2	Not loaded - just a term of art.  Conspiracy is at its most fundamental level: an agreement.  It speaks not to a lack of evidence or anything like that.  Conspiracy is the agreement.  The conspiracy itself occurs when Person A says to person B: wanna do XYZ, and person B agrees.  Before Person B agrees, there is no conspiracy.  Said otherwise, it is an agreement between 2 or more people to carry on some behavior that is, almost universally speaking, illegal.
-	-	You made him delete his posts you big meanie. I hope you're proud of yourself now. 
0	3	They are playing with fire.
0	6	Why would they do this?
-	-	In downloads:  '07/02/2011  04:02 AM         1,138,688 **victory_cat.mdb**'
-	-	The US government has made people "disappear" for less than this
-	-	[deleted]
-	-	'Conspiracy' implies there's no(or little) evidence to support it.

0	5	Why don't people hack CIA or NSA? The FBI are good guys.
-	-	I think the title was pretty clear when it said "FBI contracters". 
-	-	That would make this a huge deal.
-	-	And as regards pronunciation: it's about working under a contract, it's not about squeezing things.
1	4	Thanks! I cannot edit my submission, but I will hope I have learned from this so that I will not make the same mistake again.
0	6	I wouldn't worry about the FBI on this one, I'd worry a lot more about a EWD, NSA and a few other groups tucked away in the recesses of our government and military.
-	-	4thelulz
0	6	Another relevant question, why would our government contract private firms to, among other things, spy on its citizens?
-	-	interweb dude, intraweb would be within the FBI's network.
-	-	I don't want my tubes clamped.   
-	-	It's plausible, but I think it's more likely that anonymous actually is doing this.  Also, I think you'd see at least some form of denial somewhere if they weren't behind this.

0	2	Yea man, this is AMERICA!

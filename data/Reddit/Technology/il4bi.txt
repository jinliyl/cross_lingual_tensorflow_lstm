0	2	Ridiculously short lifespan, especially since 90% of those stories would go unnoticed in the early days of the site and never get seen at all.  The site would need traffic constantly to justify such a short lifetime for articles to be properly judged.
-	-	I saw this 5 hours after it posted and didnt bother to read it because it was destroyed anyways
0	5	Every eight minutes... an article dies.  *SAD FACE*
-	-	Sounds like 4chan.

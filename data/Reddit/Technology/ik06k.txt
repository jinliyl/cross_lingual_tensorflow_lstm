-	-	Right. usually its pretty easy to figure out which one to tun on but sometimes I see a list of sites and have no idea which one to turn on to get it working and end up turning them all on to get the page to work right.

-	-	That's what great about NoScript. You can select which sites can run scripts withing a page (such as blocking Google Analytics and its ilk).
-	-	Oh trust me, I realize there is an army of people hired to market to me. That changes absolutely nothing about the situation. Unless someone is physically auctioning me off like some sort of modern slave trade, I don't want anyone calling me a fuckin' product. Its insulting and its hyperbole to the highest degree. I can only imagine how someone with enslaved ancestors must feel about ridiculous statements like this.  If people *really* felt like fuckin' products they wouldn't be using the services. They'd move to a nice rural community where they don't deal with it. But people don't feel like products because they aren't products. They are consumers. They are potential buyers. The owners of a mall aren't selling us, they are renting property to retailers. Websites aren't selling us, they are renting bandwidth to retailers.

-	6	The collusion links to and uses data from the PrivacyChoice TrackerBlocker.   As I understand it, TrackerBlocker creates cookies for those websites that allow you to opt-out and sets the cookies to the opt-out setting. Wouldn't it be better to just not accept the cookies in the first place?

1	4	T'was all in jest haha. The actual product seems legitimate.

-	-	Technically, it isn't /you/ that they are trying to sell, it's your personal info, likes and dislikes, and other things like that.
-	-	I'm saying that the site is implying a level of collusion which doesn't exist. Individual ad networks are able to track you across each domain that they're on, but this tool is showing a spider's web of links between everyone which doesn't exist.
-	-	Well, in my case, I never use ad supported software so I don't have that added benefit. But really, if you have a really huge hosts file, your internal DNS has to go through that each and every time it resolves a web page just to make sure it isn't on that list and that has to tie up some resources of your system.

1	-	It's not bad, but it's good to just be aware of.  If you become too reliant on Google it can shut you off from the rest of the world, if you think you get the same search results as someone in a different country, or even just different browsing habits.  You can use [duckduckgo](http://www.duckduckgo.com) if this kind of filtering bugs you.
-	-	I can't remember the article, but the idea is basically called 'the filter bubble'.  The gist is that as the news, search, and other 'content' sites become more and more tailored to you, the actual portion of the web (and it's variety of ideas) that you get exposed to gets smaller and smaller.  As your individual 'bubble' gets more and more refined, any new information you see becomes more and more uniform; this in turn reduces your ability to incorporate new ideas into your existing knowledge, particularly when it comes to philosophy and opinion.  In effect, this system shelters you from ideas different from your own, leaving you more isolated from the world.  Another concern about giving so much power to opaque algorithms run by unaccountable organizations is that they could easily be influenced to push a certain agenda.  A simple example would be preventing anyone from seeing a certain story or opinion, but they could do far worse.  Imagine if a search engine or news list gave a slight push toward a certain political party, or opinion on a certain issue.  You might be opposed to a mandatory death penalty for uploading movies, for example, but if every news article seemed ok with it, or every search result on the topic seemed to extol the benefits of such a policy, you would probably grow more complacent about it; particularly if the 'push' started out small, and slowly grew stronger.  Sure that's a ridiculous example, but tilting a 'grayer' issue multiplied by millions of people could have profound effects on public policy, and all by modifying a few servers.

1	4	Adblock+NoScript+Ghostery  Block the ads you don't want, block the JS from sites you don't trust, block the tracking cookies, period.
-	-	Pretty sure it has something to do with that little "Share on reddit icon" that's present everywhere.
-	-	This also works in real life.
-	-	Adblock doesn't block javascript or flash, which can both be used to uniquely identify your computer. Add in noscript and you're pretty well off. It also doesn't block cookies, but you can control that with browser settings. And don't forget the user-agent string...
0	-	That is missing the mark a bit though. The idea is not that we are the products being sold, but that we are shown what we want to be. You are shown every day what to buy, what's cool, what's current, and like it or not your purchases and where you spend your time are influenced by this. You are given an idea of how to be and forced to conform more or less due to peer pressure.This is what the essence of the quote, "we are no longer the consumer, we are the product" comes from. 
0	2	Tinfoil doesn't work, it protects the brain but not the body, and the body can be used to control the brain. Anyone serious about security knows that you need a hazmat suit to browse the internet safely. Duh.
0	1	Oh my god!  Somebody should make a list of these corporations that are trying to separate me from my money, so I can give my business only to the ones that want me to keep all of it.  ...  Come on.  Nobody separates me from my money.  I spend it.  Sometimes I spend it with companies that have worked hard (perhaps nefariously) to convince me that I should spend it with them, but the fact is that *I spend it*.  If more people would own their damned decisions, rather than blaming poor choices (and I've made lots) on others, the world would be a better place.
0	3	Seems creepy to me either way.
0	1	If they're tracking us using our credit cards, why even bother with the stupid loyalty cards? They're just a waste of resources.
-	-	He said outside his bubble, I'm sure he realizes that it's just a different bubble.
-	-	Bookmarking the permalink ain't a bad idea. The problem with RES is I lose all those comment saves as soon as I clear out my temp files.
-	-	I still think that it depends on who is tracking you. If i'd tell you that some of those cookies are from a group of crimnals collecting information about you to find out if you are worth being robbed, then it would certainly be creepy. As a user you just don't know who's tracking you because most of the time you're not even aware of it. Even if the intentions of those who are tracking you are good, you don't know how secure your information is in their hands. It's an opaque system which makes it even more creepy than people following you because if somebody is following you, you can at least see who it is (maybe a beautiful girl?). The fact that credit card companies are tracking people already for a long time only makes it worse.
-	-	Yeah, I @replied the guy who made it on twitter so hoepfully he see's it.
0	1	&gt;The idea is not that we are the products being sold  If that's not the idea then why say it? In fact, here's an idea, don't fucking say it if that's not what you are trying to say. We aren't simply a product. Retailers are selling to us and they organize their market by what people want. They buy ad space and advertise. Its so completely inaccurate and demeaning to ourselves as humans to call ourselves products.
-	-	I won't argue with that, its an accurate statement... unlike the preceding one.
1	4	I said hosts.**txt**/zip :) But now it works.
0	1	Dear god, try watching zero punctuation with no script on.  It's a fucking maze.  They have loads of useless shit on that site.
1	4	Without a good NoScript implementation in Chrome, I've been staying with Firefox even though I'd be interested in switching. Its whitelist only approach works perfectly for me.   It is amazing to see how many different domains are blocked sometimes on one web page. It is also interesting how many different sites are loading facebook &amp; fbcdn, etc. content. I like choosing when I'm being social, and when I am not.  For example, Salon.com is a popular site to link to from Reddit. Here is everything that is being loaded on the Salon front page: http://i.imgur.com/sbYR0.png 
-	-	There is however an audit trail on your local computer via cookies written by some of these sites. You can with a couple of smarts rubbed together solve that issue.
-	-	1990? Ahh, your age beguiles your wisdom young one...
-	-	Watch [this](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cool/view/), it may open your eyes a little. Realize though that this is just the tip of the ice berg. 
-	6	Like?
1	-	You have the choice.  If that is what you want then don't support web sites that show you targeted advertisements.  Simple.  That fat guy doesn't have to use gmail or Amazon.  If you want the businesses to change their practices - then you need to tell them directly.  Don't hide behind regulations.  Transparency would be good - but that is already in their best interest to expose.  Assume that everyone is giving you targeted advertising and refuse to use their services until they transparently tell you that they do not. 
-	-	The problem with that though, is that data sets thought to be aggregate or anonymized have been proven to be analyzable to draw out many unique users and in some cases determine their real identity.  Do companies spend their time doing this? For the most part no, they don't ACTUALLY try to find John Smith and spy on him individually because there's little to no value for them, and high risk of bad publicity, but they have enough data that they CAN do it, which is worth knowing about if nothing else.  example: http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/09/your-secrets-live-online-in-databases-of-ruin.ars  http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/12/securitymatters_1213  http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090327/1118574277.shtml
-	-	And then they get surprised because they can't get insurance for some reason no human knows. They may fit into profile of people where 0.1% of people who match the profile cause $1m losses in claims. When they do risk analysis, expected loss for every customer matching this heuristic an incredibly inaccurate profiling is is 0.1% * $1m = $1000. So you may rage over the fact that you must pay $1000 more than others just because you have bought some books, music or videos that is used to profile you. 
1	4	Does that really do the same thing? Because I'm all about that, good call!
-	-	Don't forget BetterPrivacy to block those LSO "supercookies"
-	-	Generally speaking, no.  Tor will prevent you from leaking personal information, but this stuff isn't personal information at all, it's just aggregate marketing information.
-	-	Your addons also help identify your browser in the wild through fingerprinting...
-	-	I didn't really make my point properly. Individual ad networks are definitely tracking you across each domain that they're on, but the tool is representing this in a way which implies levels of co-operation which don't exist. A more honest way to show it would be to show each ad network with a list of domains that it's been seen on.  I've seen the studies on uniquely identifying people. I don't know if anyone in the industry is using it, but I honestly don't know why they would. They can already identify someone uniquely by setting a cookie. But again, that doesn't "identify" a person, it just groups their information together. We know you visited sites x, y and z. From that, we've run analysis and determined that places you in demographics a, b and c, and as such we'll run ads against you which we think are relevant. That's all it means. We couldn't tie that to, say, someone's physical name or address, and we wouldn't want to. There might be people in the industry trying to do that, but the vast majority of us are looking at things as giant pools of certain demographics and nothing more.
-	-	Maybe you're just that good about using the internet.
-	-	Disconnect for Chrome too (blocks social media personalizations).
0	3	That particularly worried me, so it's not getting installed...

-	-	Sounds like Neal Stephenson. 
-	6	Not hard at all. That's just easier. So what's the problem. ?
-	-	... and that's the answer. Because the information is being allocated for one reason, to separate you from your money.
-	6	Doesn't adblock already block this?
0	6	So I installed the FF extension. Now what? What the fish am I supposed to do to see what I am supposed to see?
-	6	it downloaded for me just fine, but maybe try the regular text version?
-	6	they already do that with the little card that gives you savings. it keeps a list of stuff you buy so they can give you coupons for things you don't normally buy.  edit: am i wrong? then why do i get coupons for a different brand than the one i just bought along withb my receipt?
-	-	It would be more like they used the security camera footage to accomplish the same purposes.  Besides, they already track what you buy by your credit card, I'm pretty sure.  (based on getting coupons related to previous purchases but not related to the current purchase)
1	4	&gt; In effect, this system shelters you from ideas different from your own, leaving you more isolated from the world.  Hrm... just like reading primarily reddit... :-)
1	6	The filter bubble is an interesting idea, and I can see how it could have a negative impact, but it seems less plausible in practice.    For instance, in WordLife's example, the only thing being filtered are the ads you are shown.  If there's a filter bubble to be wary of, it's user-created, not externally-created.  In other words, I already filter content, either through only subscribing to specific subs, only searching for content that fits my views, etc.  (Hypothetically, anyway.  I try to explore outside my boundaries, but for argument's sake I still significantly filter what I seek or view.)  The danger, I suppose, lies in the *if* the approach is amplified significantly, as you suggested it might, and search engines hide content from you.  This is very dangerous, but *if* it's geared to steer you towards content and interests that you already agree with or like, again the net effect would, in theory, not differ very much from the self-imposed bubble I mentioned.    I'm not saying either is good, and the latter is definitely more heinous, just playing devil's advocate for the ultimate outcome of these bubbles and how much of a threat they pose.
1	4	This is exactly how I feel about Chrome. 
-	-	http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles.html
0	2	&gt; If somebody would follow you when you go shopping to see what you're into, would you feel uncomfortable?  Probably.  But if I knew that the supermarket was tracking my purchasing patterns and using that to move the stuff I buy into the same area of the store, perhaps surrounded by stuff that other shoppers with similar tastes buy, I wouldn't find that creepy so much as convenient.  I guess I'm inclined to wonder how much of the creepiness of some guy following me into the store is due to the store knowing what I buy and sharing that information (which is analogous to cookies) and how much is due to some guy following me around everywhere (which isn't analogous at all).
-	-	They already do. They're called "loyalty cards", "rewards cards", and the like. The store tracks what I buy and uses it to provide a better service, while I get discounts and rewards perks ($0.XX off gas or some such).
1	-	You need to take responsibility for your content.  If you only use a few sites, even without tracking you created a bubble.  Someone who only reads one paper has created a bubble.  Do you subscribe to sub reddits - trackerless filter bubble.  the people you follow on Twitter - your filter bubble.  Google Plus, same deal.
-	-	It's not such a rediculous example. Look at our major news corps. There are left people who watch MSNBC, and there are right people who watch Fox. I'd be willing to bet that if Fox started to run with it, people would lap it up.
0	2	Ironically, the site totally breaks when you're running noscript.
1	4	i found [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gieohaicffldbmiilohhggbidhephnjj) chrome extension helpful.
0	1	Sorry but this thing is total crap. Just because sites might drop cookies from the same ad companies doesn't for a second mean that they're able to track you across multiple domains, or are linking that data together. In fact, the individual sites have no access to any of that data. They're dropping cookies as part of an agreement with the ad networks.  Each individual ad network may aggregate information about you across the various domains, but this tool is implying links among the sites and ad networks which simply don't exist.  **EDIT**: Why the downvoting? This tool is presenting information in a dishonest way and by downvoting me you're just helping to keep people misinformed and paranoid about this stuff. I couldn't give a crap about karma - this is an alt account anyway.. I'm just trying to offer insights into the industry from the inside.
-	-	have chrome, too lazy to launch ff...
1	-	if my work doesnt know that i log into reddit, then they're doing it wrong.
-	-	technically the reddit and facebook buttons that're around the web need the cookie to enable upvote/like inline on the page rather than having to leave the page to like/upvote the page you're seeing.
1	4	I use and recommend a custom HOSTS file, managed with the free program HostsMan. I also use Ghostery, NoScript, Taco w/Abine, Better Privacy and Trackerwatcher (all Firefox add ons). They all work without conflict. I also have begun using https://duckduckgo.com/ for all my searches. It implements into every browser, including Opera They are really doing an awesome job with this "no track" search engine alternative.
-	-	tor. 
-	-	As I'm using noscript, sites like these can't see shit about me and never have been unless I explicitly allow them to. To those people using a custom HOSTS file, do you know how INCREDIBLY inefficient this is? Which would be more efficient, telling one site it's allowed, or telling 1001010111 sites they're not allowed?   My advice to anyone whose afraid of being tracked is to read up on basic internet security and configure your browser to match your tastes. Everytime there's a "ZOMG THEY CAN SEE WHAT JOO DO!"  scare on Reddit, or any other site, I smirk to myself (a very smug IT-hipster smirk might I add) and check it out, and it's always the same result "this site cannot find out anything about you as you need to enable X Y and Z before we can track you".   So take back your privacy already and stop allowing these idiots to rape your browser!
1	6	My question is that if you have add blocker installed and never see the adds then whats the big deal?
-	-	The same way we know you, mushpuppy, aren't working for a behavior tracking site: waterboarding. 
1	4	Yea, I'll get right on that with all those skills that I have. 
1	4	There is always a choice, and this is a simple one, don't use any of them.  If Richard Stallman can do it, then so can you.  I'm not saying that is a fun choice or a reasonable choice or a good choice - but the key word here is "choice".  You have it to make.  Sometimes they are hard and less convenient to you.  But you are taking advantage of someone else's services and you have the choice to NOT do that.  Don't take away their choice or the choice of those who choose to use their service just because you don't want to be inconveniences by your own desires. 
0	2	If somebody would follow you when you go shopping to see what you're into, would you feel uncomfortable?  It probably depends on who it is.  But with these companies tracking you on the web, you can't really know who's going to see your file.
0	2	You don't understand.  *They might know more about you than your friends!*  ...  Of course, if the most important thing your friends know about you is that you visit IMDB and recently shopped for a stereo online, advertisers might not be your biggest problem.
1	-	Humans are logical animals, but we have two problems. First, our logic works on data we receive (Garbage in garbage out), so if we don't get necessary information, we cannot make a right decisions. Second, we are highly biased with different kind of emotions, and our emotions can be manipulated by what we see, read or hear. Saying all of that, a company with lots of information about me, lots of processing power to analyse my habit and classify me, and a huge database of knowledge about each of those classes, can easily change my decision in the way  they want, and we wouldn't even notice it. If it is just about selling candy bars, it might look harmless, but this can also affect politics and are voting decisions.  A very simple example is a fat guy. Assume Mr X is fat. He buys 2 pies every day. Advertisement companies classified X in Fat people group, and based on that they show him whole bunch of ads about delicious, but unhealthy foods. Now Imagine Mr X decides to lose weight, but he doesn't have any power over his classification. The next day when he sits in front of computer, he will still see ads that encourage him to eat, and eventually break his will. This is a very simple example, but a more complex manipulation can also achieved using advance data mining and psychology. A product manager can train us to like his product against are wish, or interest. That is the problem. Note that I am not against customized web experience, but I think it must be regulated, transparent, and I want to be in charge of my data. I should be able to modify it.    Edit: Spelling
1	-	If that is 'all' the do, its not so bad. But they have a lot of info, and nothing stopping them from doing more. 
1	6	What is privacy?   I'm not going to answer that question - we all have our own definitions - but certainly being anonymous and untracked is a large part of it.  If a neighbor spied on you starting with "public" information - what car you drive, do you rent or do you own a home, what you do for a living are you married or single, have you been divorced and then went on and kept track of private and personal stuff - what shows you watched, what newspapers you read, what music you listened to and everything else about you - you'd do whatever you could to stop the situation.   Typical large companies are like the hypothetical neighbor. Their thirst for information is unlimited. They don't define words like "private" and "personal" in a moral or ethical sense. Their working defintion of words like those - is to just reach out and grab as much as they legally can. And sometimes (most of the time?) they will go over legal boundaries to capture yet more data. They want to know all that stuff that makes you - you.  Before the net was as it is now - it was theoretically possible for companies to gather info about you. But they'd have to do so manually and grab one paper record at a time. And, of course, it was absolutely a financial impossiblity.   Before the digital reality even the most powerful companies and corporations in the world wouldn't have tried. Efforts at alchemy would have had a greater chance of success and been cheaper too.  But now we live in a world of digital inter-connectedness. File cabinets worth of data about you can probably easily be had. And all that data is valuable. Very valuable. 
-	-	Well, the goal is, indeed, to be transparent to you. The problem is that the data is not kept to just one company or aspect. It's used in any sort of data mining activity that you have no control over. (A classic example of this was that ~~several banks~~ [a major canadian credit company](http://www.thestar.com/business/article/799986--what-the-data-crunchers-know-about-you) determined that you were highly likely to miss a payment on a loan if you bought a drink in a particular bar in Toronto. That means meeting a friend, or going on a business trip and stopping off at that bar because you picked it at random could impact your credit rating.)  There's also the potential that your data could be sold. The old ACLU's [Big Brother's Pizza Shop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4LtYMNl4yw) shows an example that is becoming less and less far fetched.  Let's put it this way, Company A knows that you like Game X and Genre B. They correlate that information with others and discover that those with similar tastes as you have a 30% chance of committing an act of fraud, and categorize you as a "moderate risk employee". Future Employer files a background check and discovers that notation thus denying you a job.   *edit to include Canadian Tire article reference*
-	-	and lastly, the condom over your RJ45 cable and the tinfoil hat.
1	4	You're exactly right (this is what I do). By allowing advertisers to target you with relevant ads, you're helping support your favorite sites. Google's empire was built on ad revenue. All the cool stuff they do for free? All paid for by ad revenue.  The volume of data we're talking about here is so massive that there is simply no privacy invasion. To us, you're all just a bunch of numbers. We see so many requests per day (measured in the billions) that we don't even log it. People see "tracking" and get worried, but the reality is that there's no way to tie any of this data back to an individual even if we wanted to.
1	4	*Thank you*.   I swear, 90% of Redditors wear tinfoil hats. How this stuff blows up like this, I have no freaking idea.   When did perpetual paranoia become so cool and accepted?
-	-	See my reply to another comment in this thread. There is no audit trail. There's simply too much data for there to be an audit trail. We look at things in aggregate. We can target 75m people in demographic x, or 60m people in demographic y. There's enormous anonymity simply due to the number of people out there.
0	5	You and I are a dying breed, judging from the comments.  I'm not *that* old, but it does seem to me that there is a generation now that doesn't care at all about privacy, mostly because they don't understand the consequences of not having it.
1	4	[as you swipe your debit card] No, joke's on you.
-	-	doesn't really matter. they don't need your identity to exploit your behavior.
-	-	Nothing is 100% impossible unless it would violate the laws of physics.  The information you have, taken ALONE might not be able to identify a person, but it's not the only information available. If someone wanted to they could use it with a lot more available information from other sources.  As you say, and I completely agree, these ad companies don't look for individual people - and I said this in my previous comment. They have no interest and little to nothing to gain for the extra cost in time and man power they'd have to spend to do it.  The fact that they DON'T track individuals, and most likely WON'T for the foreseeable future, doesn't change the fact that it is possible to do so if someone were so inclined to try. That's my only point, that it is, in fact, proven to be possible. Also, the fact that the ad companies don't do it, doesn't mean someone else, with more malicious intent, couldn't gain access to the data (legally or illegally) and then use it in this way.
-	-	Very possibly, but it's still not creepy so much as inconvenient.  My point stands that the reason your original analogy is creepy isn't because of anything that carries over well to the case of cookies, but simply because some dude is following you.  Which makes it not so much an apt analogy as a disingenuous one.

1	7	Neato, thanks a bunch
-	-	The thing about open source is that you don't need to personally verify the source, you can have other people verify it.  While you still have to trust some outside people, it's now harder to sneak something past, as you either have to be clever enough to hide backdoors, or powerful enough to barr code reviews.  This assumes people actually review the code.
-	-	Yeah, I mean, it's 2011. People should have knowledge about how to do standard computer actions like to compile a source code to fit our individual needs.    EDIT: What's the character/text setting to indicate sarcasm?

-	-	I also am a fan of NoScript, but I find the attitude you express in your 1st paragraph to be bordering on elitist (in a bad way).
-	-	NoScript won't do much if you're worried about tracking companies. You should be using RequestPolicy (along with NoScript) instead. A default deny cookie policy wouldn't hurt either.
-	-	lol

0	5	Probably too many replies down and we forgot *smile*
-	-	I posted that earlier, but I deleted it after actually looking at the sites in question. I am fairly sure they don't all have reddit buttons. It's probably the reason for it happening, but I only see facebook, twitter and myspace buttons on IMDb for instance, so I side with WhiteZero's statement.
1	6	Be careful with hosts blocking! It might slow down your internet connection when you use that huge list below in this topic :) (because all outgoing connections need to be checked against that huge list)   Other than that, it's very effective and works universally for all browsers and applications with embedded browsers! You could for example use it to block Live Messenger ads.

-	-	This is really the way things are now, nothing is private that you do online. it's not all bad...  Pro: I'll get somewhat relevant adds et cetera. Con: It's creepy, audit trail you may not want... 
-	-	It's also possible to opt out of ad tracking by accepting a special "opt-out" cookie. For Google, this can be done [here](http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/) and for a broad array of other sites there's [this](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) site. This is browser-specific, and the settings will also vanish if the browser cache is cleared. Google offers a browser plugin to avoid the opt-out cookie from vanishing.  Though, I'd say not accepting cookies from third-party sites and/or using addons like NoScript/Adblock+/Privacychoice/etc. is the more acceptable solution for more advanced users.
1	6	Can it show what happens when I have privacychoice and NoScript installed? I assume this will make a difference, and maybe that site is just trying to FUD me.
-	-	you can disable third party cookies in all browsers
-	-	FYI: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?q=Collusion&amp;cat=all 
0	5	It's bad when that data turns up in background reports and you don't get jobs because of your activities.   "So Mr. Pickle, it seems from your background report that you play video games.  You are 25, don't you think that is a bit childish."  then you don't get the job.
0	6	Anybody know what version of firefox the add-on works with?  I was told its incompatible with mine.  FF 3.6.18
-	-	Would love to install - craps out everytime. "Javascript stopped execution" error. 
-	-	Blocking third-party cookies is by far the easiest thing you can do to throw off most tracking techniques. I still dream of the day browsers have them blocked by default. 
-	-	Mine had some stuff about reddit the first time I checked, and after that its just all blank.
-	-	Used NoScript for years, and I use privacychoice, because I'm not the brightest at IT, and it seemed a good idea last time I looked at its webpage
-	-	Phone app has a save feature. Homes.
1	7	took a look at my domain, i'm thankful the only red dot i have is google ads. not great, but acceptable.
0	2	It is impossible to have any other choice. Give me an option for email, search engine, social networking, news website that does not perform these practices. Even those websites that are paid still track you and sell you advertisements. 
-	-	I recall a story about a woman who would buy baby food for her pets, and started receiving coupons in the mail for diapers. The reward card bots assumed she was a new mother and responded with targeted marketing.
1	4	I just removed it.  Oh well, fun concept.
-	-	I can't speak for everyone in the industry, but I can tell you it would be 100% impossible to identify an actual person with the data that we gather, and there's no point either. We're in the business of delivering relevant ads online. Nothing more, and I think that's true for every single one of the ad networks on the internet.

0	2	I hate when people say that, its such bullshit. I'm not a product. If you want to call yourself a product go right ahead. If I use something I do it because I want to, I'm not using it to be bought. Fucking Christ. The only people who say this bullshit are people who are trying to get you to stop using a product or service and switch to another product or service. Or maybe they are just fucktarded. Maybe brainwashed. Point is, if I use facebook I'm not a product, Im using their service. In the process of using their service, I see a few ads. Big fucking deal.  Its equivalent to saying, "Hey you just walked into a mall. You are now a product because you are getting in for free and people try to sell stuff to you." If someone said that to me I'd give them a swift punch to their fuckin face for being a total faggot.
-	-	Dunno, mine just shows 4 grey dots, PayPal.com, Toolness, Google and Reddit.  Keep in mind it's pulling all data from your plugins and all tabs, some of which refresh without your knowledge.  Edit: Toolness.org is a parked site, but is just the collusion site. Google.com i'm guessing is the google search bar Not sure about PayPal.com, but maybe reddit gold related.

-	-	Installed Ghostery a couple months ago, it's insane how many websites track you...I was trying to explain it to the Mrs., it was much easier to install Ghostery on her machine and let her see for herself.
0	2	Ctrl-F.    Upvoted.    It's frickin' disturbing to see how many sites try to track you.  ABP+NoScript+Ghostery FTW!
-	-	And if it's just blocking of the tracking sites that you want rather than displaying info about them, then Adblock does that too. In Firefox:  **Tools -&gt; adblock prefs -&gt; filters -&gt; add subscription -&gt; add different subscription -&gt; Fanboy's Tracking/Stats blocking**  So as far as I can see, you don't need Ghostery as well as Adblock -- and I'm trying to limit the number of addons because they slow down the Firefox startup.

-	-	Use HOSTS file to block ad tracking
-	-	So, they track you, know you're interested in Game X and Music Genre B, they find out more people who visit the same websites are also into said items, they provide ads directed towards you, and get some freebie market research. Why is this bad in the end? It's almost transparent to you.
0	2	It is too much work, bitching is so much easier.
-	-	Please slide your sam's club card here...  
1	-	As a more concrete example, the "customers who looked at this item also bought these items" thing on amazon is very useful.
-	-	Yes it is, I don't have that problem.. I'm on my phone too.
-	-	I always thought that supermarkets were doing this already with those discount cards. 
-	-	This is why I frontpage /r/politics although I'm not entirely political, and other subreddits. I just want to see what's happening outside my bubble.
-	-	Actually supermarkets are using that kind of information to put the products that I'm interested in as far apart as possible because that makes it more likely that I see something that i didn't intend to buy but might end up buying anyway.
-	-	Yes.

0	2	Reddit1990, I don't like your posts.
0	1	Joke's on them. I used a fake name and phone number. Also, I frequently forget the fake phone number and have to get a new card. F U trackers!
0	1	I don't have any of those cards because I'm loosing control over my privacy when I use them.
1	4	I've been using this custom hosts file for years now, it doesn't have any noticeable delays/performance issues.  Sure it's inefficient, but it blocks ads from within programs also. No windows live ads, no xfire ads, no aim ads etc.
-	-	I don't think they're implying that websites serving ads are themselves tracking you across domains, they're saying advertising companies can track you across domains that run their ads, which is absolutely accurate and which companies like DoubleClick (that is to say, Google) openly admit and are *proud* of, because it allows them to serve more relevant advertising that is specifically tailored to your browsing habits.  When they mention Facebook as being capable of tracking your browsing, they're correct as well: every website that has a Facebook "like" button on it is feeding signals back to Facebook that will allow them to determine what sites you visit, even if you don't interact with the "like" button in any way. If you ran Facebook, why *wouldn't* you use that information to profile peoples' habits and serve relevant content to them?
-	-	&gt;doesn't for a second mean that they're able to track you across multiple domains,  A cookie can be uniquely identifiable, and when dropped by an ad company, it can be re-read by that company when you visit a different site.  ARE they tracking you across these sites? I have no idea. CAN they do it (is it technically possible)? Yes, absolutely.  The EFF did a study where they demonstrated 80% of browsers have uniquely identifiable fingerprints (This does not include cookies or IP addresses) and it's possible to track a browser, even with changes to data used to fingerprint the browser, with a reliability over 90%. Add in use of cookies, javascript and flash for anyone not blocking them and almost every browser can be identified.  The base rate was about 1 in 280,000 - with many millions on the internet that means you're still reasonably OK, but the odds change if you run javascript or flash, upping the base odds of tracking you as a unique user to over 94%.  With additional algorithms, they were able to successfully track users, even after fingerprint changes (changing data that is used to identify the browser) with a reliability of 99.1%.  So you might be ok as long as you block javascript and flash (NoScript plugin will work) - block potentially tracking ads (adblock) and change other information like your user agent string to make sure it matches common values.  source:  https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2010/05/13  and the linked pdf on that site "browser-uniqueness.pdf"

1	4	That's a cat-and-mouse game the browsers cannot win. Extensions are the best way to make it happen.

1	4	I've been a user of NoScript for years, and I will never uninstall this add on. Any reason you use privacychoice as well? I googled it quickly, but I'm not entirely sold.

0	2	For me the issue is less like someone following me around the store when I shop.  I am cool with amazon knowing what I am looking at on their website.  But I don't necessarily want them following me around everywhere else I go to see what I am into.  I want to make the decision about what I want to see, not have some random algorithm decide for me.  
1	4	I love Ghostery. This needs to be the top link. Installers, make sure to turn on blocking as well, otherwise it just identifies the trackers.

1	6	LiveJournal has always had the most amazing feature set, pretty much unrivalled by other blogging platforms.  I think a few things have failed to see it "take over":  1.  Going paid premium too early, just as a plethora of free systems was springing up  2.  Having a difficult and limited customisation system (compared to other blogging platforms)  3.  Losing out to Blogger in Google's algorithm (whatever Google says, Blogger blogs get heavily weighted in its rankings over LiveJournal blogs.  I can attest to this, having maintained an identical blog on both platforms)  4.  Being a "blogging" platform rather than a social networking platform, putting off those that just want the social features - and yet not giving a blog the sense of "individual websiteness" that Blogger and others do (see 2.)   5.  Missing market opportunities (which one can also criticise Reddit for. Why was there a market need for Disqus, when LJ's amazing, unrivalled comments system could have filled the void?  Similarly why do so many sites now outsource their comments to Facebook, why hasn't Reddit stepped in, for example?
-	-	&gt;customized feeds  This is what Circles is all about, isn't it?
0	3	I'll check it out! Give me a couple minutes.  Oh god.      "permissions": [         "http://*/*",         "https://*/*",         "tabs",         "cookies",         "management",         "notifications",         "contextMenus"     ],  That's a lot of permissions, and it wants access to every site. Why?   That's about it. Chrome is a lot more secure with extensions so you can't do a whole lot there.
1	7	Understandable.  Thanks for replying anyway.
-	-	I understand the basic concept of what it's supposed to do, I haven't shared any pictures myself.  The problem is I expect people to dick it up. Either sending the pic to someone else in a differencirclele. Or crossharingng said pics otwitterer, Facebook, etc. I live by the rule that no matter what you do people will break it.
1	6	Must have got lucky I guess.
-	-	Almost all of Windows services use Facebook integration. I can put Skype &amp; my email on my business card. When people contract me through those methods I can import/export them straight into Facebook. Where I can then use them in other services depending on how Fconnect is used. Hell there's in a Facebook plug-in for Outlook.
-	-	Bing allows you to plug Facebook into your searches. Possibily Yahoo since its power by Bing but I haven't used that in years so I'm not sure.
-	-	The only people who I have on Facebook, who aren't on my Google+ are the people who are "friends". My actual, real life friends all switched as soon as they could.
1	6	Is that why Russians always add my LJ for some reason?
0	5	The whole Brazilian obsession with Orkut and general shunning of others has always struck me as kind of awesome.
1	4	It's funny because it;s true.
1	6	Your ignorance is astounding.
0	3	Amen to that!
0	3	It could be just how the strange extension system they used works. Still. I don't trust this thing.
1	7	Hah, that was it!  Forgot I had that installed.  Thank you.
0	6	I seriously don't get what the difference is.
0	2	I had this problem too. I believe the contacts are put into their own group when you import them from the CSV, so you have to move them over to the 'My Contacts' (Default) list or whatever so G+ can pick them up.
-	-	Sometimes sarcasm comes across as ignorance on the Internet. 
0	6	Really? I was actually referring to facebook connect. G+Fb isn't about migration, it's about actually overtaking it. Something like Yahoo messenger. Now you no longer need to have a yahooID to use messenger. You can use the messenger as a facebook messenger and talk with facebook friends. No need to have a separate ID i.e No need to have a yahoo id.  My point is, then you don't need to get a new account. Whatever new social networking sites come along, they will just be *extentions of facebook*. It already has absorbed the competition with connect (fucking myspace has it) and so you won't or rather can't part with facebook anymore.
1	7	Thanks!  I tried that but nothing happened.  It just refreshed to my Google+ feed.
	http://techbend.com/2011/07/03/google-plus-invite-to-facebook-friends-import-on-google-add-facebook-list-google-cirlces/
0	6	Why?
0	2	Wow that is incredibly stupid and useless.
1	4	Game over, man! Game over!
-	-	Safari Yoohoo
0	5	Strange, i don't feel any excitement at all.
-	-	Doesn't work on ie........darn
1	4	Cool. Can I have a Google+ invite now?
-	-	aw, i thought the API dropped.. just an extension, bleh.
1	4	And Twitter. And my blog. And even MySpace. I want to be able to type something up on my phone and annoy everyone with it at once!
1	4	Now all we need is a way to post our Google+ streams to Facebook, instead of posting seperately for each site. I'm thinking a little blue F icon next to the share button on Google+.  
-	-	A social network inside a social network. Mind blown.
1	7	google+ came to me at a very important time in my life, college to real world transition. While I still have a couple of semesters in college it's nice to know when future employers do a background check and 'google' my name they will see my google+ public profile, which will essentially be my resume. I love this concept. 
-	-	I opened the code, decided to make a few comments. If you want to read my findings (might be a bit technical), go ahead. But I'm just going to make this clear: **DO NOT INSTALL THIS**. This addon acts like malware and the service is a security vulnerability waiting to happen.   If you did install this accidentally, read the child replies to this post, there are instructions on how to remove this provided by several people.  The following notes were from the Firefox version of this addon (which I was able to get by looking at the script on the install page), but I'm sure the Chrome version pulls off similar ploys.  I've grouped my notes into four categories (I hope this makes everything easier to read and understand):  **PRIVACY** (for issues regarding the addon and what it does with your data)  **SEC** (for security risks)  **MAL** (for unwanted changes the addon makes behind your back or malware like functions that are performed)  **MISC** (for various other notes that don't fit the previous categories).  * **SEC**: The extension is dependent on remote external javascript (meaning, it needs to go download a JS file before it can even work. This happens on every startup). Mozilla does **NOT** approve of this practice for reasons such as MITM attacks and server security (someone gains control of that server = all clients are now at high risk). It's why [Conduit Toolbars](http://conduit.com) are not allowed on [Mozilla's Offical Addon Repository](http://addons.mozilla.org).   [This is the file](http://app-static.crossrider.com/plugin/apps/manifest/519.xml) the addon requests the current javascript file from. [Link to current JS file](http://app-static.crossrider.com/plugin/apps/js/519.js).  * **MAL**: The API makes multiple references to a premium service. What this means is that if the author of the plugin fails to pay the service money, CrossRider can force all users of the plugin to install additional crap. This is a forced change that you cannot opt-out of.  * **PRIVACY/SEC/MAL**: You have no idea when [this file](http://app-static.crossrider.com/plugin/apps/js/519.js) will change. It's downloaded at start up and ran with window chrome permissions (this is considered dangerous). At any point in time, the author could basically say fuck you and change it to start data mining. But that's okay, because the change will happen in the background without you ever knowing. **Ever**.  * **MISC**: [Here's the page](http://googleplus.crossrider.com/facebook_stream.html) it injects to gain access to your FB data (you must accept this before it can do anything with Facebook).  * **PRIVACY/MAL**: It also tries to [install an OpenSearch plugin](http://crossrider.com/plugin/opensearch/ff/0.xml) and [redirect the search page](http://search.crossrider.com/google?ref=se&amp;q=) that Firefox will go to when you type in a search in the URL bar (like just typing in "What is Reddit?", Firefox would redirect you to a Google result screen, instead this addon makes it redirect to a page CrossRider controls). This seems to be making revenue for the developers. Additionally, **these changes do not get reset on uninstall**. Also, their search plugin is extremely deceptive and is trying to sound like it is the default Google search plugin that is bundled with Firefox (while the icon gives it away, the plugin itself uses strings like "Google powered web search" in order to make you fall into their ploy). There's code in the addon that forces their OpenSearch plugin to override whatever your default search engine is (Normally Google) in your search bar (provided you have a searchbar on your toolbar, you can press Ctrl + K to bring it into focus). However, this change only happens if the plugin is registered as non-premium, however, that can change without warning.  * **PRIVACY/SEC/MAL**: It actively (and at random) looks for known webmail domains and starts reading your emails until it hits a quote block which it then uses to append a signature to your emails in order to get your friends to start using this software. Social engineering high-o!  Currently, the signature "feature" runs on the following domains:  &gt; * mail.google.com &gt; * mail.yahoo.com &gt; * webmail.aol.com &gt; * mail.live.com  * **PRIVACY**: This addon sends browser stats while it is on the manage screen. Data sent is the browser type, addon version, script version and this value called bic (which I assume is supposed to be unique [considering it only gets set after receiving data from the server]). It might do this in other places as well.  * **PRIVACY/SEC**: Google Analytics can be injected into any page the plugin author chooses from window chrome (this is rather bad, privacy wise). At the moment, I don't see anything currently calling this function, but it is there and ready to be put into any and every page ever. To stay safe, I recommend [NoScript](http://noscript.net/) (I believe it might be able to block this addon from injecting).  * **MISC**: The API code is obfuscated everywhere, which is normally done in an addon when you have something to hide. It also makes this incredibly difficult to read.  * **SEC**: There are a ton of content permission hacks in order to mount remote JS and run it at a higher permission level. It's rather lame considering Mozilla gives you safe interfaces that allow you to do this safely.  * **MAL**: Several mentions in the code to overriding your browser homepage. There is one place where I see this happen, but I don't know if any function actually calls it. This code is an absolute mess.  * **MISC**: You can change SOME of the settings while it is installed, MAYBE. Judging by the code, the settings application doesn't seem to work very well. Your mileage may vary with the options window, but it looks like you can't do anything if the plugin is registered as non-premium.   * **MAL**: Uninstalling will not revert any of these changes. The code does not watch for an uninstall event at all, so it can apply any of this shit whenever it pleases and never have to clean it up. The "Easy to Uninstall" part on their page is bullshit. Premium or not, this stuff does not get cleaned up.  * **PRIVACY**: Your FB data does go through their service. They don't have a privacy policy or a terms of service (which is surprising considering they've been around for a couple of months). This should be a red flag.  So should you trust these guys? In my opinion, **fuck no**. Do **NOT** install this, it does more harm than anything. Stay the hell away.  EDIT: Added updates, removed the other edit notes.  EDIT: I might have misunderstood the premium feature. On further inspection, if the author is listed as premium, the addon will not override all the search features by default. However, even if the plugin is registered as premium, it still sniffs your emails and does all the other bad things.  EDIT: Made update portions fit into each point better.  EDIT: Added note categories, hopefully this makes it easier to read.
-	-	Data mining, much? Or no?
0	2	Oh jeez... might as well include webshots... still getting emails of X many views this week... didnt know anyone even used it anymore.
0	1	I couldn't get it to work.  Just gets stuck at the loading screen.
-	-	Not much to take then...
-	-	Because on Google+ you have circles to add the people you don't care about.
-	-	It's also running slow for a lot of people depending on your region. I finished setting up a cicle and then just logged off because of the lag.
1	-	Give it a few years, and most people will *want* to start over. 
-	-	YOU'LL GET CAUGHT UP IN THE...
-	-	We put a social network in your social network so you could read about your friends' mundane lives while you read about your friends' mundane lives. 
0	7	Reap sympathy karma, duh!
0	1	I installed it.  You can't see notifications or messages.  You also can't actually comment on anything, you have to open Facebook separately.  I found it useless and uninstalled.
-	-	Chrome extensions routinely require those permissions in order to complete even the simplest of tasks. The "your data on all websites" permission is required for an extension to modify a page, which is the fundamental functionality of Google+Facebook and almost every other extension in existence.
-	-	TIL I'm a moron 30 or so times over....
-	-	Actually, a moron would be someone who freaks out over basic extension permissions. The "your data on all websites" permission is required for an extension to modify a page (the fundamental functionality of Google+Facebook). You can't do anything without it.
0	6	Then don't use it? 
-	-	They're hitting Facebook where it hurts by using the service without the sweet, sweet ad revenue. 
1	7	Thanks, dude.
0	2	This is why I haven't touched any G+ extensions yet. Waaay too soon, there's gonna be issues.
1	7	Thank you very much for doing this.
1	4	GET THIS MAN TO THE TOP!
1	7	Thank you so, so much! I installed this on Chrome, and am glad I saw this. I know you're not a Chrome developer, but is it possible any of these things could be transferred into their Chrome extension? Oddly enough, my search wasn't overrun (I use the almighty DuckDuckGo), and I'm not sure how to find the rest of these problems in my preferences.
1	7	Yeah when I saw this I looked at permissions for the Chrome extension, saw that it injects content scripts into all sites and was "oh no you didn't".. It is also not in the Chrome web store which is exceptionally suspicious. Fortunately for Chrome users an extension can't run arbitrary code on your system and become more than a browser extension. So for Chrome users if you just uninstall the extension it will be gone. For Firefox users unfortunately that is not the case as every extension can pretty much do whatever it wants :(.  Thanks for looking into this and warning people about it.
-	-	I posted a link to this on the comments of the app itself.
0	5	Wow, my apologies! This extension was posted by lifehacker so I automatically trusted it was ok. Lesson learned, for sure.
1	4	Hey RDJ :-)  Strange running into you randomly, but I thought you'd want to know this comment was (rightly so) bestof'd.  http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/ila7i/roguedarkjedi_reveals_the_dangers_of/  Good work mate. Nice to see that healthy level of paranoia :-)
1	4	Most impressive. 
1	4	No, but they might come to G+ as well. It's like dualbooting.
-	-	I suppose it's more the will of the person. I have not smoked and never plan to but I am a person with what you would call a addictive personality. I used to be addicted to many things and lately I'm addicted to almost nothing(Reddit is borderline addiction).   I used to drink lots of soda and I cut myself off cold turkey and have not drank soda in nearly 4 years. I also used to be addicted to Runescape(5k hrs would not be a stretch) and now I don't play it at all.
0	2	I for one look forward to Facebook when all you holier-than-thou nerds move to Google+.
1	4	That's wonderful, however the rest of us have more than a handful of friends. And as it stands I think I know 3 people who have even bothered to get an invite.
-	-	Swapping from facebook to Google+ is like cigarettes to cigars then.
1	6	Russia is to LiveJournal as Brazil is to Orkut?
1	6	Facebook? Real men use Friendster.
1	4	Exactly, and like dual booting its a pain in the ass. Make your mind up and use one or the other. And everyone uses one, so I'm sticking with that.
-	-	For starters, Google+ works a-ok on my Netbook, Facebook lags like hell. Seems the G+ page is lighter.
-	-	That slashfiction won't write itself!
1	4	heh, quite alright. You pointed out that I did need to go back and rework the updates into the main points now.
-	-	LiveJournal has features that neither Facebook nor Google+ ever had.  First, threaded discussions (reddit-style, sans up/downvotes, though).  Second, customized feeds (so that pr0n newz feed does not mix with family news).  Third, "friending" has always been one-sided (like in Google+ now), and you had tight controls over who sees your posts (again, like Google+ "circles" now).   For these (and other reasons), LiveJournal is still *the* blogging platform of choice for Russian intelligentsia (or not-so-intelligentsia, as it always happens with blogs). In turn, for this reason it was bought by a Russian-owned company last year.  This is to remind you once again that there are lies, damn lies and statistics. Statistically, a small percentage of people uses LJ; however, a large percentage of Russian bloggers use it, and other platforms don't matter as much there. 
1	4	Long live LJ!
1	2	Your friends are not going to suddenly leave Facebook, I hate to tell you.
-	-	 In five years it will be trendy to hate Google+
-	-	[deleted]
-	-	  every body said that about myspace....
-	-	Baby steps...
-	6	Never heard of it. Is it also a CrossRider addon?
-	-	It'd be taking the content from it minus all the garbage surely.
-	-	I bet some people still used Facebook, Myspace, and update their Xangas on a regular basis with sweet new layouts.
-	-	It imported everything but it seems my list on my Circles hasn't updated yet. Was it instant for you?
1	4	There's also a cool new feature that allows you to stay in touch with your Facebook friends. It's called Facebook.
-	-	Yahoo has probably seen more traffic in the past week than they have in the past 13 years combined because of this.
1	6	When was the last time you tried this? 
-	-	just import your facebook contacts into a yahoo account, then export your new yahoo contacts into gmail.  viola! facebook contacts in google+.
-	-	No need to even bothering with the install.
0	6	Going to TWO different websites? Who has the time?
0	3	OMG BUT BUT BUT I GAVE FACEBOOK ALL OF MY INFORMATION AND NOW THEY ARE USING IT!! THATS EVIL!!
-	-	[Actually, RogueDarkJedi has done did a nice write-up that's far more informative than anything I'm going to do for you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/ikymu/googlefacebook_allows_you_to_view_your_facebook/c24mfci)  But, since you asked for a remotely confusing line of code, dig the class names: &gt;$(".a-b-d2Q2jb.a-d2Q2jb.d-s-r").prepend('&lt;a id="fbbutton" href="javascript:;" target="_top" class="d-h a-b-h-Jb a-MZ5lwb d-s-r a-b-xXL0oc" &gt;&lt;span class="a-b-ckIqx a-ckIqx"  style="width:18px;height:18px;background:no-repeat url(http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/pub/facebook_footer.gif) !important;" data-tooltip="Facebook"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;');
-	-	Seeing as how this is a platform that they're trying to sell (or will be in the future), I highly doubt they're going to just start randomly tracking your Facebook stream or anything else. If they do, you can bet it'll be front page news within minutes.  I've looked at the code, I've sniffed the packets, and I haven't seen anything intentionally malicious. It seems more likely that they're using this as a demo for their platform, and trying to pack in every advertisable feature regardless of whether or not Google+Facebook really needs it.
-	-	Top post is referring to Firefox. Nothing in the chrome extension prevents it from being uninstalled. That said, you'd probably still want to disconnect it from your facebook account.  Privacy Settings -&gt; Apps and Websites (bottom left) -&gt; Edit your settings
-	-	And all the stuff from them will be kept apart in the incoming section, which doesn’t appear (and clutter up) your stream.
-	-	TIL
-	-	Yo dawg, I heard you like social networks.
-	-	When connecting with Facebook, they require access to ALL of one's information, contacts, etc and the ability to access, store, and sell my information at any time. No thanks; I can simply click a facebook icon on my bookmarks bar and have a better experience and not some marketing jackals using my information for their benefit.
-	-	No, but leaving people behind on Facebook is a major advantage of Google Plus.
1	4	&gt; In fact, not a single line of Google+Facebook code is obfuscated, and it's all clean, readable, and commented.  That's simply not true. Even it were, it pulls in code from external files, which wouldn't need to be obfuscated, given that it could change at any time without notice... 
1	4	Exactly.  You know what I do if I want to stay in touch with the people I'm close with?  I call them.  I invite them to dinner.  We chat on MSN, like we always do.  Facebook really shines at sharing a few stories with me about the people I'm not really close with, but who I clicked with and enjoy hearing about.
-	-	Haven't looked at the Chrome version, but yes, the XML file is how it updates.  &gt; The chrome extension is just a .zip file.  XPIs are the same thing.  &gt; For chrome, you really don't have as much flexibility (or in this case, keys to everything) so I can't assume it's any worse than the firefox version, but it's still terrible.  Definitely so.
-	-	&gt; But I'm just going to make this clear: **DO NOT INSTALL THIS**. This addon acts like malware and the service is a security vulnerability waiting to happen.  Does that help?  I'm going to go in and change my updates in a bit. Cause they aren't updates anymore, it's been over 3 hours since they have appeared.
-	-	RogueDarkJedi-- you're no Sith. 
-	-	No.
1	4	Well that's a good sign then, I hope!
-	-	The xml file it requests is how it updates itself (not sure if you figured that out already). It's in the extension manifest as the updateUrl.  It's actually really easy. The chrome extension is just a .zip file, and you can click "continue" on the bottom, get the pop-up to install, but you can copy/paste the ext and then just cancel (it deletes on cancel).  For chrome, you really don't have as much flexibility (or in this case, keys to everything) so I can't assume it's any worse than the firefox version, but it's still terrible.
1	5	Yeah, no worries.   While I enjoy LifeHacker every now and then, you should know that LH rarely tests the stuff they are suggesting, and when they do, they never actually look at what the software does behind the scenes (because in most cases, that's not easy to do, it takes time and they have a story to write).  EDIT: suggest should be suggesting. Sigh.
-	-	Good, it's best to keep everybody safe.  Unfortunately, the developers are likely to take down the comment or lash out at Reddit for slander or whatever.   It's not our fault they put bullshit in their addon without telling/warning anyone.
-	-	I was expecting someone to ask this soon, so I started making a list of stuff you have to do.  **EDIT**: Some of these changes may not have applied for this plugin because it is registered as a "premium" plugin, see my updated notes in my original comment for more info.  ---  First thing is first, uninstall the addon via the addons manager. Restart. If we attempt any changes while it is currently installed, they will be overridden again.  Next you need to change the following preferences (go to [about:config](http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config))  * browser.search.selectedEngine  * browser.search.defaulturl  * browser.search.defaultenginename  * keyword.URL  For each one of these, make sure that you right click and **RESET** the values. Provided this addon didn't override defaults (I didn't see it do that, but I could have missed something, this code is ugly), you should get either your last known good value or the Firefox default.  Next, you need to delete the OpenSearch plugin. Right click on the search icon in your search bar and go to "Manage Search Engines".  Find the one with [this icon](http://crossrider.com/plugin/images/opensearch.png) and click Remove. Select the default Google search plugin and click Make Default. Then click okay and restart your browser.  If everything worked out, your browser should be safe again.  Now, you must go to Facebook and remove the Google Plus application from your profile.  **EDIT**: Thanks to [JacktheSmack](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/ikymu/googlefacebook_allows_you_to_view_your_facebook/c24n4nz) for reminding me that you still need to remove the Google Plus application from Facebook.  ---  If you want to be completely clean, you can use prefBranch.deleteBranch (super advanced here) to remove the 15 billion preferences it adds, but I would advise against it as it's rather advanced.  **EDIT**: Because someone will be curious, I believe the code to delete their pref branch is (copy this exactly and it should work, though you might want to be safe and backup your prefs.js file first):      javascript:Components.classes["@mozilla.org/preferences-service;1"].getService(Components.interfaces.nsIPrefBranch).deleteBranch("extensions.crossriderapp519");  You would paste it in the evaluate bar in your Error Console (Found in the Tools menu). Click the eval button to run it  **EDIT**: The above code will now work, I just copy pasted it from one of my addons and I **know** that it works in there.
0	2	Go to facebook privacy settings &gt; Applications &gt; Remove "Google Plus"  In Chrome, remove it from tools &gt; Extensions  In Firefox, Tools &gt; Addons
1	4	I brought some JATO orangereds! Strap it in, and hold on!
1	4	&gt; arbitrary code on your system  Technically, it still does. I have a feeling the Chrome version also contacts the server for the JS file it needs to execute, which makes it just as vulnerable.   It still runs in the browser, but should a hacker take over the CrossRider system, all users are instantly vulnerable because the JS changed would be sent out and executed on all client browser instances.  &gt; become more than a browser extension  Well, it's still a browser extension, except it does change settings that should not be changed without a really really good reason (like it adds a full browser to the mail application, thus a startpage is also included, because how can you browse without some sort of startpage? That's bland).  Anyways, glad to be of service.
1	7	Thank you. :D
1	7	Whoa. :O  Thanks for letting me know, that's really cool.
0	2	Ugh... embedding facebook in google+?  No thanks.
1	7	I was going to post that sometimes a re-boot can be helpful, which is all the techie stuff I know. I now want to meet with a speeding train, thank you RogueDarkJedi. 
-	-	K
0	1	Shit just got real.
1	4	Google+Facebook allows you to view your Facebook stream as you're facebooking in Google+ while you FACEBOOKGOOGLEBOOK!!...+!
-	-	You should tweet that.
1	4	The best part is that you don't have to switch from Top News to Most Recent.
0	6	User setting/permission wise? [Not much](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/ikymu/googlefacebook_allows_you_to_view_your_facebook/c24p017). They're still doing the same stuff in terms of logging/sniffing/scanning as done in Firefox.
-	-	I NEED a Google+ invite.
-	-	Now we need an extension to view Reddit in Google+. A front page stream. Thanks
0	5	Never heard that one before... [](/wayevil "YES I HAVE!")
0	2	Because of Google+ I deleted my Facebook yesterday, but my Myspace and Livejournal sites are still active.
-	-	Windows Live Writer.
-	-	At least give us a tl;dr.  it;s just doesn't cut it.
0	2	Too many edits, too many updates too much technical lingo... can you make a tl;dr for us dumb folk?
0	5	Wow, awesome work. Have you looked at the facebook to picasa photo app? I don't have a link right now unfortunately.
0	1	Thank you. Why the fuck is this post downvoted!! Fuck you people, if it weren't for him I (and a lot of people) hadn't known about this. Even if it was not "serious". It's useful INFORMATION!  For the downvoters who downvoted **RogueDarkJedi**, fuck you.
-	-	Yeah, the whole point of it is getting away from Facebook, eh?
-	-	It's a process of weaning yourself off. Like a long-term smoker, old habits die hard. You need a change of surroundings! Also, it's a temporary solution until all your friends join G+.
1	-	&gt;Easy to uninstall.   Install, invite your real friends to Google+ - uninstall.
1	-	I get what you are saying completely. We'll just have to see, really. It could come out like you said, or it could end up in the dust.
0	5	This is why I wonder why people seem to like the tools to invite all of their facebook friends. Probably 50-90% aren't really friends anyways, why not start over with Google+?
-	-	it seems like a good way to wean your friends off of Facebook. Possibly the biggest hurdle G+ faces is the idea of having to start over.
-	-	After the mass influx of new users yesterday my Facebook stream suddenly IS in it. 
0	2	It's more the fact that they're asking for that wide scope of access to begin with; regardless of whether they actually utilize all that data, I'm not at all willing to test the theory.
0	1	Then fuck it then.  An extension that asks for permission to do whatever the fuck it wants and does as little as let you see a feed but not interact with it (besides the fact that it's trying to cross platform 2 things that are meant to be separate)?  Useless + invasive = shitty.  So yeah, if you installed it, that still makes you a moron.
0	1	You *can* - as an extension author - actually specify which [pages you need access to](https://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/manifest.html#permissions). The user will then get a popup [like the top one](https://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/permission_warnings.html), containing a URL rather than "on all pages". This chrome extensions requests access to:      http://*/*     https://*/*  That said, I skimmed through the extension code and all it *seems* to be doing is add the facebook icon. When you click it, it adds an iframe to the center of the page that loads [this page](http://googleplus.crossrider.com/facebook_stream.html). I could not *find* anything malicious, but keep in mind I just took a quick look.  Does this mean it's safe to install? Maybe. I'm staying the fuck away personally. Let's say there's an update where the addon author starts tracking what pages you visit, the information you give to said pages, etc. Chrome won't ask if this is alright, since **you** already allowed the extension access to all pages, be it http or https. Also, what is to say they won't be scanning/modifying the facebook stream before passing it on to you?
-	-	I found it. It's above the circles "Find and Invite", you'll magically have a large amount of new people to potentially invite.
-	-	Uninstalling doesn't actually do anything. Read the top post if you haven't.
0	1	adding a new circle today called "Why?", as in "Why the fuck did you add me on google+ when we haven't talked in over a year"
1	6	I'd love to hear how that isn't true. By all means, show me a line of code that is even remotely confusing.  Edit: Also, I just skimmed through every file and didn't see anything that could be mistaken for "pulling code in from external files." You're just making shit up.
-	-	I understand where you are coming from. I use Google+ in the sense that if there is say, a song or video, that I hear that I would like to share with a group of like-minded individuals, I'm not going to call each of them and tell them to listen to it. Facebook made that easier, but Google+ is better suited for sharing specific things to specific groups easily. I can share personal things with my friends circles and business related things with my "business" circle and they don't intertwine. Of course I still call my friends if I am going out or making plans, I use social networking for sharing of art, media and opinion more than building actual friendships.
-	-	And Google is the Wal Mart of the internet.
0	2	So did Google assimilated all other web search engines. I don't think I want to root for either side. 
0	2	Exactly. Assimilation is defeat.
-	-	&gt; Also: Facebook is the Borg of the internet.  Does that make G+ Species 8472?  I mean, what with all the people having sex because of facebook.. I'm _sure_ they can come up with some sort of biological warhead..
-	-	Either you got really lucky, or the master server turned off those features, because by default, all of those items should be added/changed the first time the app is installed.  Then again, given the *fantastic* coding job that makes up this app, it's possible there is a bug that caused the code to not work. The function that makes these changes is called the first time the app runs so it is actively modifying these values.  There's no way they were removed on uninstall unless Firefox 5 has something that monitors changes an extension makes and reverts them (which I thought was only a concept at the moment).  The only other way is if the addon itself watched for an uninstall and cleaned itself up, which I know it doesn't do.  I could tell you why it happened if I installed it or faked a session with the master server in order to see what it sends (because it does listen for something from [this server](http://push.crossrider.com:8000/faye)).  EDIT: Run-on sentence.  EDIT: It was probably because the addon was toggled as premium, which doesn't change those values by default.
0	2	I haven't looked at what it does in Chrome as I'm primarily a Firefox developer (on the browser front that is).  I could dive in, but I don't know the Chromium API as well as I know Gecko, so I can't tell you of all its dirty tricks there.
-	-	Wasn't too big of a job for me... clicked a button and typed a bit 
-	-	Or you could go to facebook.
-	-	If you are using Firefox, the steps are the same for all platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac, etc etc)
0	3	First off, thank you for the insightful post!  &gt; My fear was that this extension falls into the second category.  In my mind, it falls under both. Executing remote javascript in window chrome is a HUGE problem, especially in the way they are doing it. But the fact they can, at any point in time, force users to install additional junk without their permission as well as the fact that it has the ability to scan your emails and inject content into the emails you write, leads me to the belief that it is also rather malicious.  However, I can see why the developers did these kind of things. Maintaining a user base for an addon is incredibly hard, much less than trying to a dollar off of it.  &gt; My point was that a Firefox extension which is blatantly malicious can trivially move outside of the browser. To put it simply, installing a dubious Firefox extension is no better than running a dubious executable. There is no barrier to prevent it from persisting on your system after you have uninstalled the extension which was the initial vector.  Exactly. I'm not even sure how I can even expand on this, you've worded it really well.  &gt; Firefox users have no guarantee that this will get rid of it.  The tutorial I posted will revert all changes it made up to this point. However, if the server introduced more changes, there's no way to make sure we cleaned them all.  However, as of tonight, I have not seen any new updates to the scripts it executes.  So in a way, by having this thing still installed, you've opened yourself to a ticking timebomb (man, that's so cliche).
-	-	Don't mention the name of the plugin or anything.
-	-	Adobe Contribute?
-	-	I think I've got one or two left. PM me with your gmail address and I'll send it (assuming I can figure that out).
-	-	G+ let's you specify groups who are allowed to automatically tag you in pictures. By default, only the "Friends" circle can do this. You have to manually change the setting or manually allow each tag. So that's a somewhat more private photo tagging system.  Doesn't solve the whole problem, but it's a step in the right direction.
-	-	http://www.reddit.com/r/googleplusinvites
-	-	PM me your addy and I'll pop one off.
0	2	This not very dissimilar to what I tell myself every time I try to quit smoking. (facebook=cigarettes, natch)
-	-	Yeah.. That method hasn't worked in forever....  There is a handy dandy plugin that scrapes emails from facebook though, I used that.
0	2	You're still giving permission to an unknown publisher to gather essentially everything from both Google+ and Facebook to do what it does.  If you're readily willing to tell a stranger to "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION SO I CAN SEE MY FACEBOOK FEED IN A PLACE IM TRYING TO AVOID FACEBOOK," all the power to you, brother.  It's one shitty extension I can do without.  Also, "internet tough guy" for dismissing a browser extension? lol
0	1	Then you also know that the extension injects 17 js-files into **every single page you visit with the extension installed**? If one of these files ever get something malicious included in them, I would never know without periodically checking. The fact they get added to every single page also means every single page can access them, which again is potentially bad.  In the end it comes down to trust. Do I trust a company that I've never heard of before - and know nothing about - to take my privacy seriously when I give them the keys to my browser? I just can't say I do.  Even if I agree they would be stupid to try something, the world is filled with stupid people.
-	-	It helps in a social sense because people can see that you haven't circled them back so they might get offended if they think they're friends with you.
-	-	I really don't think Google+ is trying to defeat Facebook so much as assimilate it. 
0	2	&gt;my parents, aunts and uncles, who are older and now that they are on FB will never move to Google+.  Do you now see why we are moving en masse? 
-	-	http://www.reddit.com/r/googleplusinvites
-	-	Cigarettes to a cultured pipe.
-	-	"the rest of us"? You speak for the whole of reddit, do you? I don't care if you have more than a handful of friends, I was responding to your comment. I like having 5 close friends who I would do anything for and would do anything for me. I still know and talk to more people then those, I just don't call them my friends, at least in my own mind, they are acquaintances. 
-	-	Truth, a majority of my friends are too lazy and stupid, so porting their life to another service seems unlikely at best. You'll get the nerds, at first, and then people will start to realize G+ is incorporated into their Google Searches, Gmail, Docs, everything! It'll be a long process but I think it will turn towards G+. idk I think I started rambling in there.
-	-	Live Writer is free &amp; for editing multiple Blogs at once.
1	4	I need G+ first!
-	-	Doesn't this make facebook somewhat undefeatable? If there is no need to let facebook go... no one will.
-	-	Not sure if want...
1	6	Does anyone really think people are going to move from Facebook to Google+ en masse? I know a lot of people- my parents, aunts and uncles, who are older and now that they are on FB will *never* move to Google+. They just won't do it. If you're the *only one* to move to Google+ but everyone is still on FB, what's the point?  
-	-	What would be nice is a way to post my links and status updates to both sites at the same time.
0	2	Didn't work for me.
-	-	Yeah, but until all my Facebook friends are on Google+..  I prefer Google+ in every way, but I do like, you know, my friends. Real life friends. Who aren't on G+ yet.
-	-	"make your own extension in minutes" hardy har har 
1	6	I wonder how long before Facebook blocks this.
1	4	Have an upvote.
0	5	Actually the problems with facebook are facebook in the first place. It's not about quitting a addiction, it's getting rid of a pile of crap.
-	-	It is also a incentive for people who do not want to switch from Facebook because their friends are still there to give G+ a try.
1	-	It worked yesterday for me.
0	5	Does ANYONE have invites? I feel like the last kid picked for dodgeball here. :[ 
-	-	Will that take care of it, or do we need additional cleaning? (Chrome user)
-	-	I'm pretty sure you don't need the "javascript:" if you're running it from the Error Console. The javascript: is only useful if you paste it into the URL bar.
-	-	After I installed, and had to go through the "allow" process for it as a Facebook app, I got suspicious and went to ask over at the developers board -- a fellow redditor replied with your work.  Why people have to be so shady with new tech is beyond me... It was at least a good "idea", just poorly executed -- though it fooled me and I don't find myself in the "fooled easily" category very often.  Seriously, thank you for your time and effort. I crossposted this on my FB wall, a techgroup I frequent AND in reply to my google+ posting about the app. 
1	7	No. Thank *you*. I was about to install this. I'm glad I read the comments first. 
-	-	So there is a difference between poorly written (loading a script over http for something you visit using https etc) and being blatantly malicious. My fear was that this extension falls into the second category.   My comment was anchored in those fears. My point was that a Firefox extension which is blatantly malicious can trivially move outside of the browser. To put it simply, installing a dubious Firefox extension is no better than running a dubious executable. There is no barrier to prevent it from persisting on your system after you have uninstalled the extension which was the initial vector.  This is the major difference between how extensions work in Chrome / Firefox. If this is merely a case of an extension that introduces a vulnerability then sure, uninstalling will fix the problem in both cases. On the other hand if this is a malicious piece of software that actively tries to stay on a system once installed, Chrome users can still simply uninstall while Firefox users have no guarantee that this will get rid of it.
-	-	Lookit YOU getting all Best'd Of, and here was me thinking you were only about the ponies.   [](/c08 "SCOOTALOO ALL UP IN THIS BITCH")
0	3	What do I do if I've already installed it on *Chrome*? So far I've removed it from extensions and from FB. A lot of this advice is Firefox geared. Thanks for the heads up :)
0	5	Yep.. my fault. I'm sleepy and I read so far down your post that I forgot the tl;dr was in the first paragraph. My apologies.  
-	-	You forgot LiveJournal
-	-	I don't think so, give me a minute and I'll find the link, I think it was on tech crunch...  Edit: Found it, [here.](http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/06/how-to-move-your-facebook-photos-to-picasa-soon-google-photos-in-a-flash/)
1	-	i like this, but i can't wait for a fuller version to arrive, so that i can manage facebook pages and basically have full facebook functionality in google plus. 
-	-	Um I guess you don't know me. When I drank soda I think it would be a 12 pack(me only drinking it) every day or a little over a day. Also trust me when you spend 4-5 hrs roughly daily looking through reddit I think it's borderline addiction. Porn sites would be sites I browse fairly often.
1	4	The odds are next to zero of somebody getting away with data gathering through extensions, seeing as how extension code is always viewable. In fact, not a single line of Google+Facebook code is obfuscated, and it's all clean, readable, and commented.
-	-	Facebook took years to become as big as it is. It didn't become mainstream until atleast 2 years after launch. I think G+ is doing a lot better since it already has several million users according to Eric Schmidt.
0	2	Exactly.  The sort of people I want to actively stay in touch with and communicate with are the sort of people that will use Google Plus, rather than the sort of people posting endless poorly shot family photos on Facebook.
-	-	Quite the opposite, I'm speaking for everyone not on Reddit. I'm tired of this stupid "oh well I only have 5 close friends that I want to talk to" argument. It's dumb. I want to keep in touch with people I'm close friends with, and people I'm not that close with. That's what the majority of people on Facebook use it for.
-	-	It's possible to have an addictive personality, however. You say it's just drinking soda, but if you only drink one soda alone and do it 5 or 6 times a day it becomes a problem.   And this habit-forming...habit can itself become a problem when it spreads to other aspects of your life: eating one meal over and over, working out obsessively, or refusing to associate with new people. It isn't physical addiction, no, but some people are very prone to emotional addiction and obsession.  Edit: Fixed spelling once I was no longer on a phone.
0	1	are you typing with your penis?
1	4	Guess so, that's good though!
-	-	It wants cookies for cross domain posting stuff.  No idea for:  &gt;     "management",  &gt;     "notifications",  &gt;     "contextMenus"  These ones I can explain:  &gt;     "http://*/*", &gt;     "https://*/*",  This is for the signature "feature", as well as for the actual functionality of the addon and the Google Analytics injection.  Plus should the base script ever change, it will need access to every website to run on. You know, because they need to add vulnerabilities to all the things.  &gt; That's about it. Chrome is a lot more secure with extensions so you can't do a whole lot there.  Or they provide fewer interfaces that can be abused by jerks. Mozilla trusts most of its developers, which is why you get such nice addons because the engine is rather extendable. But the recent abuse is why we've been seeing a much larger push by Mozilla to secure their platform and encourage people to install addons from AMO.
-	-	Circles is about that, but, even more so, about choosing who you wish to share information with.
0	2	Drinking a lot of soda does not equal an addiction, also please don't belittle addiction by using the phrase borderline addiction for a website you likely just browse fairly often.
-	-	Whelp, it's over. Chalk one up for Google.
1	6	So how do you fully uninstall it if you already made the mistake of installing it? 
0	1	Don't they know you're not supposed to cross the streams?!?
1	4	Nice try Zuckerberg.
-	-	Yo Dawg  I heard you like social networking
-	-	Oh wait...if you can get an invitation
-	-	Why would you want to view fb in google+? The entire point is to leave facebook. 
0	6	Now why would I want to do that?
-	-	Yo dawg, I heard you like social networking   So we put a social network in your social network
-	-	Disable the Facebook Disconnect extension if you have it.
-	-	But... the best thing about Google+ is that my Facebook stream *isn't* in it.
1	4	Very cool! Here's a way to transfer all your Facebook friends to Google+ as well, if you'd like.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoR0lirqRWE  Instructions for people who do not want to listen to my stupid face:  Sign up for Yahoo. Go into Yahoo mail, Contacts tab, import contacts. Click Facebook logo, OK to share contacts.  Select all your contacts, export all, export as a Yahoo CSV file. Go to gmail, contacts tab, and create a "Facebook" group for your new contacts to land into. Then "more actions" "import" then import the Yahoo CSV file.  Go to Google+ and Circles tab, then "Add and Invite" and they're all there! It's like magic that you performed yourself!
-	-	Social Inception
1	4	[Yes actually](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/ikymu/googlefacebook_allows_you_to_view_your_facebook/c24mfci).
1	7	Thank you, but strangely none of these things were changed on my Firefox 5 install. I simply uninstalled the add-on and looked for the about:config entries you mentioned but I either couldn't find them, or they were set to default. I didn't have a opensearch plugin either.
-	-	A lot of Firefox suggestions.. any issues in Chrome?  All of my searches appear to be default.
-	-	worked for me yesterday.  what plugin?
1	7	Rad! Thanks, man!
-	-	It may be a bit of ghost town still (not all my friends have their invites), but aunt *crazy-christian-I watch-way-too-much-nancy-grace* isn't on it.
--		You just want something new and hip where your family aren't? Seems like a big job to create a completely new account at a new site and invite your friends to it, when all you could do was not adding them, or just add them to a group that you hide in all sorts of ways.
-	-	Well facebook has literally assimilated all the other sites. Let's see who wins this one.   Also: Facebook is the Borg of the internet.
1	6	Yeah, is Facebook getting info from Google+ that can be used for profit?
-	-	Yeah, it's definitely not worth downloading. I'm just sayin' that it could be the cross-browser extension system overreaching its boundaries rather than the developers, since people also usually feel the need to point fingers.
1	4	You clearly have no concept of how browsers or extensions work. The ability to modify a page (e.g. change a background color) requires access to the DOM. If you have access to the DOM, you inherently have access to the data on the page. Google's warning is informing you of this reality.  Fortunately for everyone that isn't an overly angry, paranoid internet tough guy, the extension only runs on the designated Google+ page, so there's really nothing to worry about.
1	6	Excuse my limited user abilities but how do you perform the same action on a mac?
1	7	I'll have to fix this, thanks for the help!
1	6	I'm curious as to why it needs to know [this much information](http://i.imgur.com/qoMmw.png) just to import the stream.   I'd also like to know if I can see my notifications and messages, because those are more important than the news feed.
0	1	came here to... aw fuck why bother posting anymore?
-	-	Yes Sir I do, why?
-	-	CROSSFIRE!
1	4	Wouldn't be surprised if Google made this extension themselves. :)
-	-	The second Google+ is announced as public, family and friends are getting the announcement that my Facebook profile will be disappearing two weeks after. The rest is up to them.
1	4	couldn't have said it better myself!
0	1	Exactly, what the hell?
-	-	NOS he needs NOS, NOW!
-	-	You need this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytc9-wGCHW0
0	1	Yeah, I saw that and stopped.  Are you fucking kidding me? "My data on all websites"?  Whoever ignored that and installed it anyway are certified morons... and probably are also the people who incredulously bitch about a lack of privacy on social networks.
-	-	When someone adds you, you don't need to add them back 
1	6	I'm surprised nobody made a joke about crossing the streams yet.
-	-	Yeah, just wait until they get all the other stuff people have said about you or pics since most people don't actually make everything private when shareing or tweeting something.
-	-	Hi everyone, I wrote the Lifehacker post about the Google+Facebook extension.  Just wanted to let you know that I have edited the original Lifehacker post to remove the recommendation and have linked to RogueDarkJedi's excellent guide here on the specific privacy violations and how to remove the extension.  For any downloads or webapps I always do basic research to make sure there is no hidden malware, but there was nothing found with a Google search at the time I wrote the article on Friday.  I currently have the extension installed on both my tower and my laptop which I must now remove.    For my part in spreading any malware I would like to offer my apologies to the community.  
0	2	People. Don't install this.

0	2	Private != for profit.  If a bunch of people got together and pooled their resources to create a company that made a telescope and kept it up it would be the same as taxes going to nasa, except voluntary.

-	-	BALLS
0	2	lol its not a Sunday afternoon project kind of deal, it costs huge amounts to launch something of the required scale and technicality into space, then to maintain it, dissect the information, and map the information and organize the information. And all this, people would do for free ?  lol seriously.  And there is a difference between "no profit" and "little profit". Yes private companies exists with little profit that do good work, but there isn't a private company out there that does something that would be their primary function and require all their manpower for absolutely No profit. 
1	7	A great deal of the work on the project is done by a private company - Ball Aerospace. My roommate works on the JWST at Ball, though, and I have a lot of admiration for their engineering.
0	-	I don't think they are afraid of science, they just see it as a waste.
-	-	Obama actually approved a budget increase for NASA. Unfortunately, the republican house had different ideas.
1	6	but the president controls the dialogue.  isnt that what the dems say?  yup.
-	-	the Webb is already a NASA project. They already have the mirror and a lot of the rest of the technology built. It would be great if they could solicit donations to NASA to complete the project instead of having to ax it, setting the project back who knows how many years.  Alternatively, a benevolent investor could build a company and purchase the technology from NASA after it was ax'd and hire the employees with the knowledge to build it etc - but that's a much bigger deal than donating a few hundred million dollars (towards a multi billion dollar project)
0	2	Launching and operating a space telescope is probably expensive as *fucking hell*. There's no way in fuck a bunch of donations and volunteers would keep it running.
0	5	Too bad it wasn't named the Ronald Reagan telescope. Infinite funding.
1	6	Can't they set up a private donation fund or something? Surely there are enough people in the world who care about science and astronomy that we could make this happen ourselves.
-	-	Makes you wonder if the Republican Party, the only political party in the world that disavows climate change in its manifesto, is the most anti science group of politicians in the western world. 
-	-	While this is massively over budget, Nasa does have a track record of over delivery on the big projects - the Mars explorers, Hubble etc. were at the limits of what was possible, but have lasted longer and done more than even the most optimistic would have expected.  Fortunately, India and China are stepping up their space programs, so scientific advancement shouldn't be set back for too long, and those working at Nasa could easily find jobs there if they wished.  Just a shame that the US is choosing to throw away a major technological lead to appease bankers and those with little scientific interest or knowledge.
1	6	How many people bitching about cuts on NASA actually man up and donate to private space programmes?  https://www.xprize.org/donate
-	-	They should cut 4 or 5 billion from the war fund and put it here.
-	-	Forget the telescope.  If you want to get people excited about space, go to [Jupiter's Moons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Icy_Moons_Orbiter) and find life.
-	-	Don't worry.  Just leave it up to the countries that can afford one.
0	1	Another thing obama is going to kill?  When will he be satisfied?
0	3	Everyone should probably contact their representative to voice their support for NASA/Telescope.  I fear that our government doesn't realize what gutting NASA will do to science/technology interest in America for years to come.
-	-	But myopic vision.
-	-	If you believe there are enough people who want to put a telescope in space, why isn't a private company putting a telescope in space?
1	6	From the article:      The cost of the observatory has soared from an initial     estimate of $1.6bn (£996m) to more than $6.5bn (£4bn).     As a result, budgets for other astronomical research projects     have been slashed, leading the journal Nature to describe     the James Webb as "the telescope that ate astronomy"  How do you know that those other astronomical projects that have been shoved aside for JWST weren't scientifically more worthy? That kind of thing has certainly happened before. A good example is GP-B, which NASA's planners ranked last on the list of missions they were doing, but its backers got Congress to force NASA to prioritize it over the missions NASA thought were much better science-wise.
-	-	The universe is probably littered with the one-planet graves of cultures which made the sensible economic decision that there's no good reason to go into space--each discovered, studied, and remembered by the ones who made the irrational decision.
-	-	I've got to think that somehow this relates to the religious right's influence on the republican party. Considering the price of this is basically a drop in the bucket compared to what most of the govt organizations spend, they must just really have it out for science. The christians are just shaking in their boots going "oh no. They'll probably find water on other worlds with this thing. That will mean there's probably life on those planets. Which then completely disproves my whole religion. We can't have any of that! Cancel this project now!" Fuck I hate that fundamentalist christians have a say in what goes on in scientific issues.
-	-	We should have contracted out the work to a company, then we won't see the telescope at all, and it will be over-budget. but at least the company would've hired lobbyists to keep it in our budget. and no one will complain about cutting it because it creates jobs. private jobs.
0	5	I haven't read a single statement from Obama on this. The republican-majority house wrote the proposition, which hasn't been accepted by the senate yet...
-	-	&gt;They should cut 400 or 500 billion from the war fund.  FTFY.   There'd still be a military budget bigger than Russia and Germany combined.
1	6	I recognise it, but where is that quote from?
0	2	no profit.  edit; many small wealth individuals would support the gain of knowledge about our universe. Even some private companies would donate, (if they could write it off as charity) But no one singular corp will send a telescope to space because there just is no profit in it.  simple as that.
0	1	Private means non public. Public means government. Nonprofits are private companies but they do not seek to turn a profit (but they do still require money and pay people large sums if needed).
-	-	uh, yes it is. private has to = for profit. otherwise you would have non profit organization.
-	-	true, and that means there will be very small amount of people that would invest in it. most nonprofits are cash strapped and usually provide services (NGO, red cross, PBS) and they would never be able to gather funds that would require to to put a telescope in space.

1	6	Instead of spending 15 minutes to reformat?
0	1	I bought a brand new Asus laptop from Best Buy a while back that was riddled with viruses and malware. I returned the laptop and picked up a Macbook Pro...I haven't looked back since.
1	4	He computer was the best one they made...and still was a squeaky plastic hunk of junk.   Also, it only came with a recovery disk that, guess what had viruses on it.   The MacBook pro is machined out of a solid hunk of aluminum.  That was two years ago and it gets better and more comfortable over time.  The thing is built to last, not built to be replaced.   
1	4	shame because asus actually builds better quality hardware

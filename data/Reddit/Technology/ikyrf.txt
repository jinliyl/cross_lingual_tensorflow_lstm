0	2	Well, you know, when a company releases POS operating systems for decades on end, always promising the next one will take care of the problems the last one created, the only thing you can count on is that if you were foolish enough to upgrade, you will hate it and it will still be a POS when you get to know it.
0	8	Sea Ray looked like N9 except it had physical trigger button for camera. It can just be one of the many N9 betas they have adopted for the integration testing purposes and for promoting their devices to operators and partners. The final phone they release may look nothing and be nothing like N9 for customers even if the core hw design is just much upgraded version of N9 from the developer perspective. 
1	4	Yea for software patents!
1	8	To be fair, Microsoft's 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th waves generally aren't impressive either. The Kinect being an exception.
0	1	what the hell?
1	-	i stand corrected
0	1	wow.  hell of a definition.
0	2	Eh - RIM still has a huge stronghold in the corporate userbase. It is eroding, but frankly not as fast as it should given how crappy the product is. But the userbase is worth something.  Nokia is also a sinking ship - but MS basically bribing them to turn them into a Win shop may play out well, it may not. I think Ballmer was an idiot for spending that much, but who knows.
0	2	That's really not what gets them a bad reputation with most end-users.  Things like Windows ME is what gets them a bad reputation.  If you don't buy a company's products because they play games with software patents, then you really aren't left with many companies to buy technology products from.
1	-	Eh, many people agree that XP was good.  I actually like Vista, but I had newer hardware for my computer so I didn't run into any compatibility problems (in fact, Vista crashed much less than XP did, for me).  Also, most people seem to agree that Windows 7 is very good.
0	8	So use Linux or a Mac or something and don't whine so much. POS doesn't get to 90% market share, you're simply wrong. 
0	8	Promoting your standard isn't anti-competitive... in fact, its completely the opposite
-	-	Office costs hundreds of dollars.  If odt and open office cannot compete while being free, that tells you all you need to know.
-	-	I provided a link to several articles, all of which explained the situation in detail. Apologies. 
1	4	I've been using Microsoft OS since 1982 (my dad worked for IBM) so I've lived the history of their OS releases and anxiously awaited the new releases with high hopes only to have each deliver new levels of suck... UNTIL XP came out. And by the way they didn't get 90% market share by NOT having a product that sucked... they got it through dirty tricks, strong arm tactics, having its employees engage in FUD campaigns against IBM's OS/2 while it was still partnered with IBM to develop OS/2. Stealing ideas from what should have been OS/2's future to release in NT instead while causing endless delays in OS/2's development. They also kept promising the moon for each new release to keep people from jumping ship. Another one of their dirty tricks was to have as part of their licensing agreements with the PC clone manufactures that they would pay licensing fees PER COMPUTER SHIPPED, regardless of whether or not a MS OS was installed. They also retaliated against computer companies that tried to ship other operating systems by threatening to revoke their licensing agreements, and legal action against them. Companies fell in line pretty quickly. You probably don't know any of this. So you sir are wrong. I've been following the computer trade journals and news with a passion since 1984, I've had subscriptions over the years to most of the industry mags including PC Week (now eWeek).   I switched to OS X in 2004 and couldn't be happier. Until OS X came out I was a life long Apple hater. Then my brother showed me his Apple clone running OS X in 2002 and I was impressed, he opened just about every application he had, including photoshop and several video files and the OS didn't even jutter the video. If I had tried to run any three of those programs my windows machine (Running XP - and about three years newer than his mac clone) would have froze requiring a reboot. I still didn't jump on board because their hardware still sucked and they stopped licensing clone manufactures. Then the Power Mac G5 came out and I was in love, snapped one up and never looked back.  
1	4	I agree about the clunk statement, I feel the same about desktop LINUX.
-	-	Two or three sinking ships will not keep you afloat. I donÂ´t see how a huge corporation inheriting another corporations flaws could be viewed as an opportunity.  We are talking of massive coordination, and fuck me if they have any.
1	4	Soon my friend soon. 
0	2	&gt; Support seems to be dying by the day  Yet, the number of apps keeps growing at a great rate.  Face it, Flash on mobile is full of butthurt, and it's just never going to take off.
1	6	Nokia is in very tight spot. Next year will be really interesting.  They have incredibly good logistic chain and they can really churn out phones like nobody else and still make profits, but their share of phone market is going down so rapidly that it might affect their negotiation power with component provides before they can increase volumes again.   If you look at the hardware in N9, it's just incredibly good phone. If they manage integrate WP7 into it and make it interesting, they have change to win big. But if their first line of windows phones flops, the whole company will go down and somebody will buy them for peanuts.   As future of the whole company depends on first few Windows phones they make (and possibly the future of Mobile Windows) and they still have lots of cash, I could imagine that there will be pretty intense marketing campaign next year and the phones will be best they can possibly make. 
0	8	Nokia is spiraling out of control. By the time they introduce their winmo phone the game will be over.
0	5	Yea it's dead.  People keep their phones for a few years. 
1	5	Window Phone will do fine as long as corporate America still revolves around Microsoft Exchange. With RIM losing ground fast, MS will have marketshare to take for those people whose lives revolve around email.  I have an Droid X and love it but connecting to a corporate server is not painless.   Last job they wouldn't allow it as there was no way to remote wipe the phone if lost.   MS understands that and has opened up Office365 to add more features to that customer base.  Plus, expect some things between Facebook and Microsoft that will bring a base of customers to that platform.      There is room enough for 3 operating system in the phone market.   MS may not be #1 or #2 but they will have enough marketshare to remain profitabl 
1	4	Steve Ballmer is the most profitable CEO Microsoft has ever had...
-	-	Considering the correlation between 'quality of what they make' and 'what Microsoft chooses to focus on', I don't think you're being clear here.   And I definitely don't agree, because I think I know what you mean anyway. Most of Microsoft's products are great, and now, unlike before, when they were just "Windows and Office" from my perspective, you can see how they're releasing a great product/service after another - Kinect, WP7, IE9, MSE, W7, Bing, Skydrive and things I'm less familiar with (Office 365). From what I see, everything they make is at the very least competitive (IE9, MSE, Bing, WP7), up to 'blows competition out of the water' (Kinect, Skydrive).
-	-	[See here](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Microsoft+makes+money+from+android).
0	5	yeh, lack of 4G is the killer right now for them.  maybe in the fall when the second batch of phones and mango comes out, it could be a different story.
-	-	&gt;current anticompetitive antics  That's cute.
1	6	And Apple is licensing "iOS" from Cisco. You'd be surprised at just how much of this stuff goes on in the tech world. 
0	8	It's not technology. Windows Phone Series Whatever 7 is a good OS by all accounts. I think they just came in too late.
-	-	And at 500,000 android activations daily that equates to $7.5 Million per day or 2.7375 billion per year.
0	8	To be honest, I think one big issue is that people have negative opinions of Microsoft, so when they release a new product, people seem to dislike it before even getting to know it.
1	4	Good OS doesn't count for shit. Symbian was good, meego is good.  
1	6	The rate at which Android share is growing is just amazing to me. Over 5% in 3 months...
-	-	They probably sell as many smartphones to their (corporate) clients as before. But, thanks to Android, more individuals have smartphones. Which meansthe same number of Windows smartphones is less market share.
1	8	Give it time. There first wave of Wp7 devices wasn't that impressive because first waves never are. In two more years we can comment on Windows Phone marketshare, but in the meantime it's like blaming Hyundai for poor sales in the first year in the US.   I know Windows Movile existed before, but in reality they are nothing alike. In the end, love it or hate it, 1 year isn't enough to decide whether it's dead in the water or not. 
0	8	It's time to get rid of Steve Balmer.  Microsoft simply has no vision and no direction anymore. I haven't personally used WP7 but everyone who has tells me it's a great. The problem is that no one gives a shit about Microsoft anymore. That's not just due to to poor marketing, either. The company simply lacks vision and is incapable for formulating a cohesive plan to get consumers excited.  It doesn't matter how talented your programmers are; if the top of the chain can't formulate a way to lead the company down a clear path, the company simply won't go anywhere.  It's time for Microsoft to find a new CEO. 
0	2	It upsets me that this is happening. I love my Focus, and I love Metro, but it's hard to continue to feel happy about its future when it looks so dismal. Support seems to be dying by the day... Adobe says they don't give two fucks about porting Flash over, and so on.  Good attempt, and I hope they bounce back and when my contract is up in 2 years I'll still want another W7 phone, but now it looks like I'll jump ship.
-	-	Here are the problems preventing me from getting a WP7 that I desperately want:  1. Didn't have CDMA support until a few months ago 2. No 4g phones  I've been waiting since they came out for a Sprint 4g phone.
-	-	*"Mango" is currently in the final finishing stages at Microsoft.*  That's the stage where they make sure it pegs the suckometer. 
0	6	From what, 36% to 1%?
-	-	This is why they want 15 dollars for every android phone sold.  They can't compete with technology so they compete with patents.  http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/iim23/microsoft_wants_15_per_android_handset/
1	4	The Nokia deal should help with that since Nokia has pretty good distribution.  Frankly I am more excited by Mango than iOS5 which I am running now. But I want my next phone to be LTE and there doesn't seem to be any indication of when that might happen.
0	2	Yah... Sticking with Symbian for so long instead of diving into Meego full speed was a *bad* idea.

1	6	Sea Ray is basically the N9 for Win, right?  We shall see - I was surprised that MS didn't pick up RIM instead - since they are going down the drain fast.
0	2	Do you have down syndrome?  Microsoft having their own standard for their own product is not unethical.
1	4	Good for you. That's exactly what I said; use a Mac. Don't call an OS a POS because you don't like it. This is what's called an **opinion**. Opinions are **subjective**.
0	2	I'm not sure how that's relevant. Just because a company makes a nice product doesn't mean they are ethical.  Yes, MS Office is a nicer piece of software than LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org. But Microsoft was still incredibly unethical about the development and standardization of their file formats.
0	2	It's not so much the promotion, it's the lying, the vote buying on standardization committees, lack of cooperation with the larger community of developers, naming their "standard" in a similar/confusing way to the competing (real) standard, including proprietary components in their "standard", not even implementing their "standard" correctly in their own software, etc etc etc.
0	1	You made me spend so much more bandwidth. I hope you're happy! &gt;:( â¸®
1	5	Well, the marketing may not be poor, but it's certainly uninspiring. Why Windows Phone when it really has nothing to do with Windows? Why not a cool new name for this new Metro-UI OS? Really jazz it up. But no, what is it? Windows Phone 7. And people get paid to name products. Yawn, MS. Yawn.
0	2	That's too bad. It's a solid OS, and very different and very pretty. I always tend to feel like I'm a hipster with this whole smartphone OS thing since I really like the alternatives like WebOS and WP7. iOS and Android are competent, but I've never been completely happy with either.  But ITT: More competition is good. Fanboys everywhere are sickening.
-	-	Safe to say people want Android phones lately. That is why MS smartphone market share is down. 
-	-	Actually Microsoft makes a couple of dollars from every Android smartphone sold, due to patent agreements. 
1	8	They really really really should have installed silverlight and the full .net framework on windows mobile 6.5.  People are now upgrading from winmo 6.5 to android.  Windows phone 7 is currently incomplete until at least this winter when they release their major "update".
0	1	I don't blame Ballmer, I blame the fact that HR has pretty much been running Microsoft for about the last 5 or 6 years, which I guess is Ballmer's fault but not directly. To make performance reviews more objective HR pretty much turned them into checklists. Every year you create a set of commitments, and your annual review is based entirely on whether you achieved them or not. So your most important skill becomes "managing your commitments," which translates to carefully "crafting" your commitments so as to guarantee that you will achieve them. Your review becomes a simple matter of checking off what you promised, and you make sure that the wording insulates you from any failures around you. Your project can go sideways and you can get a good review anyway as long as you can check off your commitments. This system is a powerful motivator for everyone to make their work as predictable as possible, to take as few risks as possible, and to "push back" when changes come up.   In the 80s and early 90s Microsoft was run by geeks, in the late 90s and early 00s it was run by accountants, and now it's run by HR.   /edit - I should add a disclaimer that I haven't worked there in 3 years, so my information may be out of date. 
0	2	You put forward some information in a discussion, telling someone to Google rather than either declining to link or actually providing a useful link is just plain rude.
0	1	I think it's cute that a single redditor thinks he knows everything there is to know about a multibillion technology corporation, and exactly what needs to be done to get people to give a shit. If only we were all as wise as you.
0	8	Agree. They do come up with some neat stuff, but tend to blow millions promoting it or just keeping it alive long enough to be picked up by the market. ItÂ´s as if they generated no buzz at all.  Aside from Kinect, I donÂ´t remember a MS product gaining much atention.   Their top people lack the charisma or drive.
0	8	Both MS and RIM are waaay behind the competition. Android and iOS are getting better by the day.  Plus MS has an image problem. It's just not cool.
-	-	Yeah, that first Zune was just alright, but the Zune HD was an impressive piece of hardware.  Which is why the Zune HD was eagerly bought by consumers, gained marketshare and hasn't been discontinued.  Microsoft is late to the party, yet again.  This phone would have gotten market traction in 2007.  It's a good product, but it doesn't offer anything special over the competition.  Also, Apple and Google are not going to stand still.  They are 4-5 years ahead, after all.  They certainly won't stop now.
0	8	If only they'd put as much effort into making a decent mobile OS as they did into their current anticompetitive antics, it would be worth buying one. 
0	2	You are a hipster.  Oh well I guess there has to be a few around everywhere.
0	1	by "way behing" he means "nobody wants it.  like zune.  Nobody wants it.
0	2	They still make Zunes? Holy shit. I honestly had no idea. I'm going to have to investigate this. 
0	8	You would know better than I do since you actually worked at Microsoft, but as an outsider, I get the impression that the level of skill isn't the issue. As far as developing products goes, Microsoft still has some of the best in the business. The people at Microsoft know how to program and create software like very few businesses in the world do.  So the impression I'm getting is that it's not the quality of what they make, rather it's the decision making itself. It's what Microsoft chooses to focus on, where they allocate their resources, and their overall direction as a company. You can have the best programmer in the world but if upper management assigns him to a useless product, his skills go to waste.  That's what happened with Apple when Steve Jobs was gone. They still had incredibly talented people but without direction, they were working on products that went nowhere and made the company greatly falter. But once Jobs returned in the late 90s, even though the general staff remained pretty much the same, the company suddenly rocketed into success because Jobs and the new team of executives actually had a plan and a vision for Apple.  I don't work for Microsoft and I'm not familiar with the company's inner workings, so I may be talking out of my ass here, but as an outside observer, that's the impression I'm getting.
0	2	This. The guy who names MS products really needs to go.  Windows Phone 7? Wtf kind of name is that? The Windows brand is not welcome outside itÂ´s PC realm.  Fucker would have called the Xbox the "Windows Game Station 2005" if he had the chance....
-	-	actually you are wrong, they only make money off htc phones  (edit more than htc)
-	-	Maybe microsoft should stop suing people over software patents if they want a better reputation.
1	4	Define "way behind the competition".  Windows Phone 7 makes Android look clunky.
-	-	???  More info please.
1	6	what, you don't think they put a lot of effort into [promoting docx at the expense of odt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization_of_Office_Open_XML)?
1	4	I love my Zune HD which I got this past March, but long-term support looks glum. Basically, WP7 is your new Zune HD.

0	1	whilst i normally ignore all arrogant cocktard replies, ill bite.  all of what you said in your second paragraph is true, but we are talking about how much speed i get and how many gigs of download i get for what price i pay for it. there can be a million other reasons why it costs the amount it does but you can't seriously expect me to believe population spread isnt a considerable factor and you cant just use sydney as the example to apply to all of australia. how can you so smugly claim im wrong, how can providing internet to 500 people in 1km square be as cheap/expensive as supplying 500 people in a 50km square area? what applies to sydney does NOT apply to where i live and it doesnt apply to where my extended family live. i live in wollongong, a commuter town for sydney but with 45 minutes of expressway between the 2 cities, i get a good connection with a 2nd party ISP because there are 300 thousand people living in my city, where as my aunt, uncle and cousins who live in broken hill can only be supplied with shitty telstra adsl1 speeds with crap all gigs with no choice in ISP because its simply too expensive for any other to setup shop, there are not enough people there to make the venture profitable.  internet in wollongong is good purely because there are enough people here for an ISP to be able to make a profit.  now, we can discuss telstras monopoly some other time but for now, you can stick your arrogant attitude up your ass and go annoy someone else.
1	3	lol, when I think of countries like australia what comes to my mind is "omg rich western countries herp derp" but in the poor country that Poland is I get 20 mbs without any limits for about 25 $ a month. These limits are ridiculous, I'm very afraid this will come to us soon (or shall I say: return, cause I remember it back from the 90's....)
-	-	the Greens control too much power in the Senate, and they oppose it I believe
1	4	Internode's customer service has always been the bomb. I've had a great experience so far.
-	-	No. Wholesale is unfiltered to my knowledge.
1	4	Hey I'm from digg too!
1	6	Never thought of that. Might apply to Canada's situation as well. Still, both Canada and Australia are countries so rich it seems weird to me.
0	5	Some people have no alternative.
-	6	iiNet have 100mbit cable yet?
1	4	i personally recommend internode, i have never ever had a single problem with them, great packages for their cost, $60 a month gets me 11.5Mbit down speed (take into account distance from exchange), with 150G limit then shaped. best deal ive seen for my needs, plus, when you call tech support, you speak to a bloody aussie :D  i dont know about iinet personally but i usually hear internode and iinet recommended as the 2 best options.
-	-	iinet or Internode. iinet have better plans, both have good customer service
-	-	Especially not when the Greens have the balance of power.
0	2	Does it really need to? If the ISPs do this voluntarily, then no government approval is required.
0	2	Even in the metro areas. I can either go with Telstra Cable, or i can have ADSL1. I dont want the slower speeds from ADSL1, so Telstra is my only alternative because Telstra fantastically implemented loads of Pair Gain/RIM units in my area, which ADSL2+ doesn't work on. Convincing them to lay copper is nigh on impossible.  EDIT: or wireless, but that is too dodgy, so nah.

0	6	Even better, that "requirement to assist in upholding the law" could be anything.   Website teaches you how to get out of traffic tickets in the AU? BANNINATED.   File sharing? DELORTED!
0	1	I give a big shit about that that massively undemocratic dick move (more than the crap legislation the dick move was used to pass actually) - but I am at a loss for anything to do about it, aside from leave. 
-	-	So would I, but healthcare has nothing to do with being watched by big bro, brosephilus.
1	4	Great, I haven't been following it :)  I just cant imagine any political party not supporting something to control the people
-	-	I'd take single payer healthcare in exchange for a censored Internet.  Well....
0	2	Your missing the point, it will never get underway without the help of the opposition to pass it, and they have stated on several occassions they will vote it down.
-	-	Downgrade to 12Mb. Do it for your country.
1	4	Internode has been rated the best isp in Australia for years now  http://www.internode.on.net/news/2011/05/222.php  http://bc.whirlpool.net.au/  internode also have unmetered steam servers as well as lots of other unmetered content so you can download games and other stuff to your hearts content.  Internode is also the only isp that has a free premium usenet service (via astraweb) for all of its customers.
0	2	They'll just block access to the sites that talk about their blocking of access...  Then they'll block access to their appeals process.  then they'll continue in that vein ad nauseum.
0	1	Dammit, Australia.  Why do have to be so awesome in so many ways, and then ruin it with shit like this?
-	-	They left out "doesn't fucking work".
0	5	This thing wont pass, there's too much pressure on delivering the NBN within the 42 billion dollar costing. The technology that was put forward for this 'filtering' is rubbish. The initial report was bogus with skewed results. There's no way that this shit will pass though both houses of parliament.
1	4	I've been living abroad for 6 years, but returning to Aus soon.  What's the best service for gaming and isn't subjected to this ridiculous filtering?  Is iinet good for both criteria?  I want a really fast connection with a generous data allowance.  Will be in inner city Sydney.
1	4	Im with iinet ...   Wanna show your support for no net filter. Don't buy your coms off telstra or optus. ;)
1	4	Once this shit gets underway, surely someone could write a (distributed?) script to run in a non-filtered country that queries random URLs (random letter, number, symbol combos which are syntax valid) and compile a list of URLs that DO exist (throw out the much larger list of URLs that don't exist).  Send it to Australia to have all of the valid URL's queried in a similar distributed fashion.   URLs that work in &lt;neutral country&gt; and don't work in Aus are the blocked ones. This would compile a nice list to follow  "scope creep".  Just an idea. Whenever I hear about these filters I just wonder if it's possible to compare sites  I just want to expose the shifty business that governments get up to behind our backs
1	4	Come on Americans!!!!  We have to take our country back from big bro-wait... 
0	2	Similiar thing coming into affect in NZ soon, except it's going to be much more worse for the account holder
-	-	[Relevant](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kOYNtgIr4Ts/TUbjlPFB7QI/AAAAAAAAACY/OFRKDgvMuZE/s1600/tiananmen-square-1989.jpg)
-	-	We said it would never pass in NZ. Then next thing you know there was a disastrous earthquake in christchurch and the government used the emergency procedure to fast track and sneak the law in before anyone had a chance to do anything about it. 
0	5	As it stands:  &gt;the telco does not appear to have modified its end user agreement to include a section about filtering  So not only are users not explicitly breaking the law by bypassing the filter (what's on the other end is a different issue entirely), but they're not acting contrary to the conditions of their contracts. So...Telstra (and possibly Optus) are just inconveniencing us? I think that it will go away soon, to be quite honest, but you're unfortunately correct. Still, no harm (very literally) in firing up Tor, JAP, or any old VPN at this stage.
-	6	True, but most of their profit in the retail market is coming from metro areas; areas which have multiple alternatives.  What I'm curious to know is whether this filter applies only to customers of Telstra/optus retail, or whether the scope includes the telco's wholeshale market as well.
1	7	They take care of your health don't they?  Well then they are perfectly capable of taking care of your internet.  Relax people, government loves you.
0	1	It really should be filtering shit coming out of Murdochland instead of the other way around. 
1	2	Nothing wrong with having a filter, but is wrong that its secret and not subject to independent review
1	4	I think NZ has gone about their implementation in a much better way.. [From NZ Department of Internal Affairs](http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Censorship-Compliance-Internet-and-Website-Filter-%28known-as-the-Digital-Child-Exploitation-Filtering-System%29?OpenDocument)
1	7	Thanks, Australia, for reminding me that there are worse places I could live.
-	-	The ability to censor everything is what all the most despicable regimes we know have in common, from North Korea, to Nazi Germany, to 1984's Oceania. It seems to be a prerequisite for a very bad society to come, and should be fought with all our energy.
-	-	First they came for the child pornographers, and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a child pornographer...
1	4	Our Government is amazing.
0	5	Its likely that the mandatory filter is dead, but the government has succeeded in getting Telstra and Optus to do the work for them anyway.   This is similar to the filter that messed up Wikipedia in the UK a few years back and AFAIK several other European countries (i.e Finland) have done so as well. Its unfortunate us Australian's seem to be the only ones generating sufficient outrage over it.
0	6	are you really that interested in pedofilia?
-	-	As an Australian, may I request a slight lessening of the hyperbole until such time as the system is *actually* abused?   To be clear, the article is not wrong, broadly speaking, but Australia is not the US. The Australian public generally has a lower tolerance for this sort of abuse than the US ("Free speech zones" would *never* have flown here). Further, since the filter is on a ISP by ISP basis right now, the free market is still in play and I feel that comparing us to North Korea or Nazis is just a *teensy* bit over the top at this point.
-	-	NZ already has a [filter..]( http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Censorship-Compliance-Internet-and-Website-Filter-%28known-as-the-Digital-Child-Exploitation-Filtering-System%29?OpenDocument)
-	-	australia's problem is purely population density, see in poland, you have alot more people packed tighter together, so the cost of the Internet infrastructure is alot cheaper then if you had to wheel out thousand more miles of cable and exchanges to service the same number of people, australia is just to damn spread out -__- good luck having another aussie agree with you when you say we need to forget our countries obsession with the 4 bedroom, large backyard house and look to cities with taller and taller apartment buildings.
1	4	The truth is that using a disaster like the Christchurch earthquake to pass this sort of unpopular legislation is downright despicable, but no one seems to give a shit.
-	-	That's a lot less funny when you realise that's exactly the argument they're using to pass this legislation. And we know that it won't stop with child pornography. It never does. "Think of the children" is basically a get out of jail free card for any and all greedy and manipulative legislation the politicians can contrive.
-	-	[Hiyooooo](http://www.hiyoooo.com/)
1	4	So is ours!  /US
-	-	i wouldnt exactly call australia rich, we are pretty well off but i wouldnt say rich.
-	-	It seems that this was a compromise between the government and the larger ISP's. Telstra and Optus would rather implement a filter that at least is somewhat functional, rather then be forced to implement the original filter - which was technically the most retarded thing anyone in IT had ever heard of.  It would seem that until there is legislation that requires mandatory filtering, smaller service dedicated ISP's such as Internode probably won't implement the interpol filter.
1	4	I'd say that our high taxes makes us *look* rich.
-	-	And free usenet and premium DI FM radio ;)

0	2	The possibility of abuse and security breaches just went up greatly.  I understand exposing corruption, but always risks passwords to email lead to passwords for other critical systems...     don't get me wrong, I am all for "standing up for ones selves" but risking the security of a nation...

It's not like the North Koreans are beacons of light and disclosure.  Honestly...if the trend towards NATO-only leakage continues, AntiSec is going to start looking a lot like the sort of tactic an enemy nation would pull.

-	-	Not sure how it works for Cisco, but for websites it's a legal requirement to be censored. So by refusing to censor you would be breaking a Chinese law.
-	-	Refusing to assist the Chinese government could only consist of not doing business with China at all.  Which would be a bugger, because they've got all the raw materials, all the cheap labour, and all the cash that's available to lend.  I'm not saying I necessarily disagree with it,  but to be against assisting the Chinese government, you really have to be against the whole of global capitalism.
-	-	Minding their own business means not to meddle with how the Chinese government operates. Part of that is manipulating their market based on how you feel they should operate.
-	-	You probably couldn't actually explain what so called Evil MS has done. Then try &amp; explain how Google &amp; others haven't done it.
-	-	Step 2 is ineffective due to China regularly obtaining trade secrets via spies. They will know about the back doors.
-	-	Well right now everyone is circle-jerking in the Google+ threads so yeah. Get your pitchforks folks we can only like one company at a time
0	2	Corporate america has fuck all to do with business in China.  Trying to compare western morales and standards in business and culture to those in China is a ridiculous comparison.    If you want to compare then compare their actions in China to other businesses &amp; organizations in China.  If they're on the good side then then they're doing good, regardless of how that stacks up anywhere else in the world.  A country and culture doesn't change in giant bounds, it changes as a gradual shift in a direction.  If they chose to leave if they couldn't play by american rules while working in China they'd be out and something likely government controlled would be put in place.
0	1	But we need our monies!!!! Fuck the people
-	-	No, you'd just be adding values other than money to your capitalist philosophy. Granted it's rarely if ever practiced on a global scale, doesn't mean you couldn't do so and retain capitalist ideals.
0	2	So it's like the super reaching interpretation of the USA's commerce clause with an "if you aren't with us you're against us" idea on economic participation?
-	-	Being a force for good doesn't generate profits, which they are legally required to maximize. Evil or not, shareholders hold the strings.
0	6	MS &amp; Cisco they know Apple's "Walled Garden" will be easily fully embraced by the Chinese Gov't and they want to stop that?
1	6	I've been living in China for a few months now and I'm not really understanding if China really is all that bad. The people here seem to love their government and are optimistic, and how the government works very much synchs with the people's own opinion on how it should be. Perhaps we should just mind our own business.
-	-	This will be controversial, but I think Westerners need to mind their own business about China until the Chinese decide for themselves they need help.  It will happen eventually, but efforts to speed it up from outside just add more examples of Western meddling that the current Chinese regime can use to justify the censorship.  If there's going to be a "Chinese Spring", it's going to happen from the inside.  And, if it never happens, then I guess their government works for them, doesn't it?  We should not be so egocentric as to presume we know what's best for other people.  Even if not a true democracy, by participating in the current regime, China, like all countries, has elected its government.  I'm not saying that might makes right.   If the common people rise up against that government, it would be irresponsible not to help them.  But, until then, just mind your own business.
-	-	I'll make the same argument I did when Google was doing this...   Look, it's not like if MS stops offering censored search in China the clouds will open up and let shine the light of freedom. Bing is going to be leagues more liberating than whatever the alternative is, just by virtue of having more pages indexed.   Meanwhile refusing to censor would put Microsoft's other business with China in jeopardy, as well as risk the very lives of Microsoft's employees and partners in China.   So bearing all that in mind, who exactly is Microsoft actually hurting by saying "yes we'll take your money to provide a search more open than what you'd otherwise have"?
0	2	Pundits in the press and on the internet have been saying that Microsoft is PURE EVIL for over a decade.  Everything Microsoft does is either evil, or is not good enough to make people change their views of MS's evilness.  The best example of this is the ["Bill Gates Borg"](http://a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/microsoft_64.png) icon used for all Microsoft stories on Slashdot.org.  It's a picture of Bill Gates as a borg, representing the "assimilate or die" evilness of the man.  Apparently becoming the world's biggest philanthropist is not enough to change people's views of him.  So yeah, I think it's a smart move by MS to say "fuck it, if people are always gonna view us as evil... then let's be evil if we can make money from it".  It's not like critics of this move were using Bing anyway.
-	6	So we start hating on Microsoft again?
-	-	Step 01: Make millions of dollars off China's repressive regime Step 02: Hack said systems with built in back door, giving unrestricted net access to China's citizens Step 03: Troll face
-	-	We don't want corporations making decisions of a political nature.  Oh wait.
-	-	Stay legendary, EFF.
0	2	As ever, corporate America will choose to make money rather than bother about morality. Just like IBM supplying tabulating machines to Nazi Germany so they could maximise the efficiency of the Final Solution. And the Bush family firm doing business with the Nazis even after the US finally got round to making it illegal to do so.
1	4	i think Microsoft is (at least partially) a force of good http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/en-us/our-actions/in-the-community/employee-programs.aspx
0	2	"Like other online platforms that do business with China, Microsoft will be required to self-censor its search results"  sounds like nothing new for Bing search results.
0	2	CAPITALISM DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY. GOOD NIGHT.
0	6	Refusing to assist the Chinese government would be minding their own business, yes?
-	-	EFF to shareholders: "stop being cunts"
0	2	I'm sure "Microsoft" (because it's basically just 5 or 6 people in a room, right?) care about what the press (sorry, Reddit) thinks about anything it does - unless it makes business cease to want their servers to work. If so, luckily, they have an entire division of the company to deal with that.   "Youse guys, fuck it, right? People think we're evil - let's just *do evil*. First, let's get some lucrative contracts providing the Chinese government with networking systems and stuff. It's the perfect cover for our real evil plan: advancing an opressive political regime.  OH NOEZ THE EFF IS TELLING US OFF!"
0	2	There is a middle ground between actively helping a totalitarian regime and actively standing against it. I'm not sure about Microsoft but Cisco has crossed a moral line by aiding and abetting the Chinese government in it's censorship technology. Sure they make profit but at what cost? I do agree that there is nothing any outside forces can do to compel any nation-state to embrace Western ideals of freedom and democracy.
-	-	This argument only makes sense if China had no local search engines, but they have plenty. Even Google at its peak had only about 25% market share compared to Baidu.com.
-	-	Microsoft has earned this reputation.
0	2	Indifference to good and evil *is* a capitalist ideal.
0	2	- They funded a third party as a weapon against Linux companies - they routinely manipulate internet standards and psuedo-standards solely for their own fiscal benefits - they have bought off people on standards boards to get their things through in order to keep government contracts  first 3 that popped into my mind

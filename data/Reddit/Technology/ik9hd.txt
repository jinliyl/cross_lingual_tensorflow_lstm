0	2	Although "freemium" games represent a large portion of the total revenue on the App Store, I don't think these games are "taking over". Only a small minority of people like these games but they spend a disproportionate amount of money. The majority of people still like to know in advance what the game will cost them.  In fact I'd guess that many of the people playing these freemium games are children who are either unaware that they are going to get a real bill thinking it's just game money, or else they don't care about the cost because they have all their bills paid by their parents.

0	2	OK, but the raw event size then goes up by a factor of 5 or so when the event is reconstructed. So it depends what we mean by "generate". A CMS Reconstructed event is 4-5 MB, which is stored in addition to the Raw.
0	2	Headline number appears to be a bit of an overestimate.  CMS has a raw event size of ~1Mbyte, and nominal collision rate of 40MHz -&gt; 40TB/sec, and the collision rate has not yet reached half the nominal maximum (50ns spacing instead of 25ns). ATLAS has a similar event size and rate. LHCb has similar rate but events about ten times smaller.  ALICE has very large events (O(10MB) in proton collisions, O(100MB) in lead collisions), but receives a reduced event rate (~30 times less than the other experiments, varying a bit with beam configuration) due to much longer read-out and detector reset times.  Which implies an actual rate of ~90TiB/sec.

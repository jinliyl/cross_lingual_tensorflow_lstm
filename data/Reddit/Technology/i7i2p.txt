1	6	I question how accurate this is, as an iphone user you will probably go to the apple store if your hardware fails  also this could be that people are having more technical issues in other areas with other phones.  lastly it doesn't show the number of users for each device calling in, if 300k of those calls were for blackberry than we could probably conclude that blackberry has more technical issues due to sheer volume.
1	6	&gt;The study, conducted by WDS, found that 14 percent of all technical support calls for Android devices could be traced to a hardware fault, versus 3.7 percent for RIM BlackBerry, 8 percent for iPhones and 9 percent for Windows Phone 7 devices.   Couldn't that just as easily mean that android devices are less prone to software faults than competitors, so it's more likely that it takes a hardware failure to actually cause the user to call in?  
1	6	that isn't what it says
1	6	Or it could just mean what it says. Android enables an environment where QA is not always at a consistent standard across manufactures. There is nothing special about the stability of the Android OS to suggest it would alter these results in such a dramatic way.  What is more appropriate to say is:   "Couldn't this just as easily mean that the comprable top range Android phones from respectable manufactures, are any where from 0-14%? Probably closer to 5-9%?"  Yes, they probably are not significantly worse or better than the competition.

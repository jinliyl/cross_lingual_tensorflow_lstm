-	-	Yep.  Microsoft basically admits at this point that they can't win in the marketplace so they will try to get money from android.
-	6	Does anyone actually know what patents Microsoft holds that needs licensing for android phones?  It sort of sounds like protection money from a possible lawsuit instead of anything too substantial.
1	4	No because Microsoft specifically refuse to give out the list citing 'administration costs' (despite the fact they have thrown around some [very specific numbers](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-free-and-open-source-software-violates-235-microsoft-patents/436) for claimed patent infringements, meaning they have already done all the work and would probably only have to attach a document to an email but the claim is they had to pay for that already and need to recoup the costs). Then the companies that get the patents have to sign a thing saying they wont redistribute the list (that assuming they ever get the whole list, MS might be worried they will tip of the devs on the quiet so they might just show enough to prove they have some patents).  The can basically go around claiming there are hundreds of patents in Linux and forcing large companies to pay them money without ever giving anyone the opportunity to fix it or find prior art. If a company says no, they can pick on 1 specific patent to go to court over such as the way FAT filesystems handle upper/lowercase letters in filenames which they [sued TomTom over](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10172575-16.html).  There was a UK court case where they had to force MS to sell Samba the [list of patents](http://www.samba.org/samba/PFIF/) for $10k and ruled that they couldn't sue over any patents not on the list. Samba are not allowed to distributed the patents list. And note this is just a list, not any rights to use the patents.  Of course they can just make a few changes to the protocol in new versions of Windows, keep refusing to implement any compeditor stuff despite it being open and get another 20 years of monopoly on the protocol.  It also doesn't stop them from using a 3rd party puppet company as a kind of patent shelter or alternative attack vector.  It also doesn't stop them from pushing their standards into widespread use. For example the new [SDXC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDXC) card format allowing for SD cards over 32GB in size uses their new [exFAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExFAT) filesystem which has new patents (Still pending). So everyone wanting to use a basic SD card for the next 20 years will need a Microsoft license. Expect basic USB flash drives to go the same way when they reach the size limit and it's not likely we will see Windows or OSX implement ext4, btrfs or anything (although maybe you could get away with using [UDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Disk_Format) which is open and in widespread use thanks to [it's use on Blu-ray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc#Filesystem), but last time I tried it on a USB stick Windows wouldn't register it and they might not allow for the write support either).  Technically all the patents are public, but there are just so many to go through, so many different components of a opensource operating system, and of course it requires both legal knowledge, programming knowledge and a very good overview of the opensource software landscape that it's not going to be feasible. Plus there are still all the patents owned by puppet companies. We saw that [Redhat/Novell lawsuit](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071011205044141) over virtual desktops from a company that had 3 ex MS employees, one of which was a intellectual property expert that quit MS and joined them a week befoure the legal action started. This happened shortly after MS's claims of patent violations in Linux and Novell agreeing to a 5 year no sue patent lawsuit agreement with MS (guess that turned out useless for them). The same company that are pushing MS techbologies such as .NET and SilverLight onto the Linux platform. The same company that where ruled as owning the Unix patents (It could be very bad is MS buy them out in the future, although the patents will have hopefully expired by then).  Plus so many of them are too vague or have prior art that they could be useless but it would require them to actually be overturned in court. A court run by a judge who is a legal expert *not* a computer one. And a court that might be in Dallas Texas (which just happnes to be where all the patent toll companies are also based), the court that is famous for enforcing patents like that.  In any case, I am not a lawyer.

1	4	You can do both.
1	6	&gt; M$  When did I stumble into Linux support forums?
-	-	Google isn't paying.   The phone manufacturers are paying.

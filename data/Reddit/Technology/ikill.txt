-	-	I think a pre-recorded soundbyte is not necessary at all. If you're in a situation you would rather just call the number and let things happen. Maybe some sort of signature chime?
1	6	Sounds like a great service, but can I make a suggestion (it seems you are the founder of OpenWatch)?  &gt;This is the OpenWatch Voice Dropbox, a service for remotely recording encounters with the police and other authority figures. This call is now being recorded.  The proposed soundbite is too long in my opinion.   People who call the phone number will already know what OpenWatch is and what the Voice Dropbox does. The current soundbite is unnecessarily long and descriptive. Also, presumably the longer the soundbite, the longer before the PBX will start recording the call, which is also a negative.  I think a minimalist approach would work a lot better.  &gt; (Beep) OpenWatch, This call is being recorded.  Or just:  &gt; OpenWatch, Recording...  Coincidentally I just received my new studio condenser microphone in the mail today, so I could do a recording or two, but as I said, the current soundbite needs a bit of re-working I think.
-	-	You should make that clear on the page somewhere, as that was my initial thought too.
-	-	That's a good point, but we're thinking about making stickers or something for people who haven't learned about the project through the internet, so I think we should keep the full description.  It also starts recording before the message start playing, as you can see in the source code here: https://github.com/Miserlou/Voice-Dropbox/blob/master/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf#L19  But if you make any recordings at all, we can work them into the mix to find which ones work best. Thanks!
-	-	I agree with the others that it's too long. Put the marketing on the stickers, but make the voice message something short like, "Recording now."

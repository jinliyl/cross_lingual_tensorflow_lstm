0	1	What a ridiculous stretch of a title!  The idea behind this work is that if you run this software and you take a picture of other people who are also running this software, then it will be able to automatically tag them in the photos.  Imagine a combination of facial recognition and spatial reasoning via wireless communication.  Reasonable reading of this: By including my phone in the loop, I may actually have some say as to whether or not I get tagged at all when people take photos of me.  Furthermore, I would get information as to who is taking pictures of me, which is a great heads-up as far as potential privacy violations are concerned.  Sensationalist reading of this: SPIES!

1	4	The joke's on them, they gotta find it first!
1	6	I have enough issues with privatized prisons, without privatizing the TSA as well. When the only motivation is profit, rather than law, let alone justice, it makes me very distrustful. Next we'll have judges elected based on the size of their corporate funding, or politicians funded by untraceable corporate and international funds...  Damn..[already got that](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_united#Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission)...
-	-	Agreed. 
-	-	You're not wrong there, but there's good folks here too.  you just have to wade past the grammar nazi's, sports fans, iUsers and "scientists" in this really diverse community.  I still think some of the best jokes are enjoyed only by the "3" people that got it and did not appeal to the teeming millions.

[This WSJ article quotes TSA saying a total of 330](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703581204574599953475913542.html) as of end of 2009.

-	-	A citation was posted hours before you asked for a citation. What good does it do to ask for citations if you don't even read the thread?  Asking for additional/supportive documentation is part of informative dialogue, and perhaps your request is genuine. But I believe that too often commentors will ask for citation just as a way of casting doubt upon a comment they do not like. Gets annoying, and is especially annoying when the documentation is *already* posted.

1	6	What does this have to do with technology?
-	-	The article is vague but I assume he was stealing from checked luggage, I kind of doubt he would have the balls to steal directly from trays as the people are being screened. If you can avoid it - don't check in valuables, it's a bad idea anyway. It changes so many hands that if something goes missing - there is no way to figure out what happened.
1	6	I wonder what their salary was. Are they being paid a decent wage?
0	1	Was he never fucking searched?
1	4	Nice! Lock that scumbag up!
1	7	He did it for our personal safety!
-	-	Hah! I used to fly out of this airport.  They stole some shit from my dad here once, and he had to go to the airline, who said it was TSA; he went to TSA, who swore up and down it was the airline.  He ended up getting a 1/3 of the stolen item's value back from the airline, after about 6 months of calling them.
-	-	You don't professionalize until you federalize and unionize.
0	1	I for one am shocked, shocked, that an employee of a government job which barely requires a high school diploma and no psychological evaluation would be caught stealing other people's shit.
-	-	I managed a computer store for a number of years adn I remember being in our Tech area when a gentleman brought in a notebook...didn't have the power adapter, didn't know the username, password or domain(the machine was domain attached) and asked if we could reset the password.  My tech started to tell him that it was a 1 minute process when I intervened and told him we had others in front of him and he would have to leave the machine and it would be ready the next morning.   A quick NT Pass Reset disk and I was in the system and found the registered owner, a law firm in town.  Called them, transferred to their IT department, lo and behold!, the machine came up missing out of checked baggage on a flight out of town the day before.  Called police, they sent FBI!  At open the next morning said gentleman was waiting eagerly to collect his notebook, and when my tech handed it to him he was rapidly surrounded by 4 agents.  Turns out he was a baggage handler and had been stealing for a while.  They took him into custody as well as a copy of our security camera footage.  About 2 hours later a younger and older lady enter the store and inquire as to where this gentleman might be since he came here to pick up his computer.  I told them he was arrested for theft and they began to insist that he found said notebook on the bus.  It was obvious that they knew how he came into possession of it when I asked if I should call the police to answer their questions and they both went out the door so fast I feared they were going to break it.
-	-	The TSA employee in question was just doing his job. With our near unlimited budget we are trying to cut costs for the taxpayers by removing potentially dangerous laptops, portable dvd. It is vigilance like his that keeps America safe.  While we understand that we have to do something to punish this employee due to the public's outcry against our evidence storage procedure, we have decided to give him a 30 day paid vacation. We view this as punishment because it forces our employee to stop doing what he loves most in this world, his job. 
-	-	Here is a [pic](http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2011/07/08/09/42/V6X4w.Em.56.jpg) of that dude.
-	-	Considering that the TSA has only existed for just under a decade ([act establishing them signed into law on November 19, 2001](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration)), the fact that they currently have 150,000 employees is pretty impressive in a scary way.  And in that time 500 of them have been caught stealing, sometimes 10s of 1000s of $$ worth, is even more frustrating, since that is almost certainly only the tip of the iceberg (assuming that they don't catch everyone who is stealing).
0	2	I was being sarcastic in response to a red-haring, distracting, and irrelevant "expanded government" argument.  But I'd argue an anti-TSA sentiment has been strong since its inception.  The internal battles TSA faces are their own.  Public outcry towards their abuse of power is ignored, so no tears are shed for them.
1	6	Are you positive you don't want to see a partnership between privatized TSA and various prison contractors?  I mean it makes the whole process more efficient, doesn't it?
-	-	Just see and touch it
-	-	Won't stop 'em trying. *snaps glove*
-	-	bad employees === bad organization unless you're in marketing.
-	-	&gt;so you think that this is a sanctioned thing? I don't care for the TSA but bad employees =/= bad organization.  Considering TSA's other egregious abuses, I fully expect them to turn a blind eye to pilfering.  &gt;Also, source?  [Source.](http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/24/news/la-trb-tsa-luggage-thefts-20110624)
0	5	My bad.  I guess the previous ~500 "anecdotes" aren't a factor here.
-	-	You're off by a factor of 100. 500 out of 58401 is 0.86%
1	6	on the other hand, the article referenced by mr_craptastic (above) states: &gt; So what are the odds that a TSA employee will steal something from your bag? In the last decade, fewer than 500 out of the TSA's 150,000 employees have been arrested on suspicion of theft, Melendez said. That's about 0.3 %  so maybe that 150K is the total employees in the last decade ? which probably makes more sense, and is slightly less scary (as a fledgling army).

0	1	ah, Reddit! I post a question about sentence spacing conventions to /r/linguistics and get downvoted into oblivion for bad subreddit selection (because sentence spacing supposedly has nothing to do with the structure of language)... and this anti-TSA/bad-cop-no-donut thread in /r/technology gets &lt;1,000 upvotes. I officially give up.   no, really Reddit... fuck you in the anus.
-	-	It isn't.  But your tax dollars are though.

0	2	You're evil!
-	-	Heh, compare the number of TSA employees arrested as criminals compared to the number of crimes they've prevented.
-	-	For those of us who travel often with gps devices, 2 laptops, digital cameras, and who knows what, this is just a friendly reminder to keep your techy toys under vigilance at all times when dealing with the TSA.
-	-	it has to do with computers.. so maybe..  techies will see this and be worried. dont know any other benefits of it being here.
-	-	eh, except it's not really the points I care about as much as repeatedly &amp; consistently (for two years) having genuine, thoughtful submissions maliciously downvoted, only to see a frontpage full of stupid memes, sensationalist titles and kitty pictures. It's just a little soul-crushing. 
0	1	Well it IS circumstantial but the TSA has proven over and over again that you WILL leave your shit in their trust, and they WILL rifle through all your shit, and do all this in private, and leave a nice card telling you they just went through all your shit.  Not the same as leaving my laptop in the careless surroundings I call my home.
-	-	upvoted for objectivity and facts
-	-	You can't divide by zero.
-	-	From the same article you reference:  &gt; Employees	58,401 (2011)  ETA:  So that puts the TSA at 500 out of 58401 or 0.0086% compared to the general US population at 0.0074%. Shouldn't they be _better_ than our average?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_prison_population

1	4	Ebay to the rescue!  They're the biggest fence/laundering company in the world.  You can sell anything and not be questioned about where it came from.
-	-	Sure you can in imaginary numbers, just like TSA security
-	-	Adding another group of handlers doesn't help this problem.
0	1	As a baggage handler, fuck you. I have taken time to close your unzipped bags and shove your shit back in. We don't have the time to sit around opening up bags so we can find the good shit. We have to download those 130 bags in 10 minutes. Before you complain about how long we are taking to get your bags back to you at the baggage claim area, we have to rush back and grab the upload to the next city so that we can get it out on time and not get our supervisors in trouble because we are at least semi decent people. I have never stolen anything, and the closest I've seen to anybody stealing anything on the job was a guy grabbing a lighter out of the belly of a plane because he had no idea which bag it came from.  
-	-	What if it was around 500 moms? Because that's how many TSA employees have been caught. That's almost 500 thieves that were caught. I would say that's a pretty big issue. 
-	-	It might seem an easy thing for some people to do, but it is just a spiral down into the criminal underworld. By then, you need to keep looking over your shoulder.
-	-	unfortunately, if you don't give them the benefit of the doubt, it rapidly turns to paranoia, except you that actually **know** that the lying and stealing bastards really are after you.   As for govts or corporations, you should always assume that they are just in it for themselves, individual people often show some generosity or altrusim, but rarely large organisations.
-	-	Given that I said no such thing, I assume you just made this up for the fun of it.
-	-	No, because several hundred of them have been caught stealing already, and probably thousands more are being protected by that foul organization.
1	6	One?  Where'd you get that number from?
0	6	How many TSA employees have been arrested now?  Seems like there is a new story like this every week!
-	-	I feel better knowing our safety is their number one concern.
0	5	&gt;We have to download those 130 bags in 10 minutes.  lol
-	-	so you think that this is a sanctioned thing?  I don't care for the TSA but bad employees =/= bad organization.  Also, source?
0	5	Lets not wait for it to get worse. Its bad enough already.   Worse = no freedoms left at all.

1	7	Thank you for respecting my wish to not be bombarded with news of atrocities I can't do anything about. /s
-	-	It's not a coincidence that anti-TSA hysteria reached its all time high right as the TSA was given the greenlight to unionize (the 'don't touch my junk' video went viral literally the day after). The politicians that are popping up out of the woodwork criticizing the TSA don't give a rat's ass about civil rights. What they really care about is preventing the TSA from becoming another powerful union, and handing contracts over to private security contractors. Many of the loudest voices in the anti-TSA movement have ties straight back to lobbyists, astroturf groups, and corporatist think tanks.  Which isn't to say that the TSA aren't a bunch of worthless scumbags. And that's really why the anti-union pro-privatization PR campaign has been so successful, it leeches off of legitimate outrage.
-	-	No one said *all* baggage handlers steal stuff. If that was the case no one would be flying. Just that it's been happening forever.  Which doesn't seem unreasonable.
0	2	i dont know where you work but i bet this shit happens in miami all the time.
-	-	*you're
0	2	At least TSA agents can't steal my penis.
-	-	I worked at a computer store that was on the other end of the spectrum. When obviously sketchy people came in with laptops that they didn't know passwords to (or even what brand sometimes, even though they were holding it), the owner would offer to buy it for 20-50 bucks, then wipe it and sell it for a massive profit.  As long as they didn't imply that it was stolen, he didn't care. I didn't work that job very long, but I know shortly after I quit, he was raided for buying a bunch of stolen hard drives. 
-	-	Mom arrested for dragging kid:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEtzWY_VwhQ  Yea it's horrible but it doesn't mean all moms are bad and that it shouldn't be used to discredit moms all around our nation.  This drama-queen rhetoric is getting way out of hand. And before you start with more drama-queen rhetoric like tyranny and unconstitutional, you might want to look up the words. You seem to have taken any meaning from these previously descriptive words.  This says nothing about the TSA. It says plenty about a dick-ass thief which exist in every profession in the world.

0	2	Did he pee in luggage too?
0	1	SPOILER ALERT!   There is no baggage heaven.  When they die they get crushed and shredded into a mulch that is used to make playgrounds, rainbows, kitties and poptarts.
-	-	Well duh, it's an internal investigation.
0	6	Iunno. The Coast Guard?
-	-	No-one, because that would require a growth in Govt, and that is not acceptable.  Except for the Homeland "security" and "intelligence" services, and the troops of course.
-	-	I've had to bring two laptops before. It's enough of a pain in the ass going through security that I usually check one and carry one.
-	-	Once I tried to take two laptops, one checked and one carry-on, and they made me remove the one in the checked bag and take it with me. It may have been a temporary or perhaps an airport-specific rule, though.
-	-	Because otherwise you get beaten half to death, tasered, and thrown in jail for a few weeks.
1	4	Absolutely, Hey! Do you want the rest of my kool-aid? We are all drinking it up. 
-	-	It is definitely only a "few bad apples".
-	-	you are assuming the consequences were unintended and unexpected....
-	-	Pfft, they just arrested random people who stole from baggage and found about 250K worth of shit in their house.  Stealing that much from regular folk deserve some timbers and a torch.
0	1	Did he have an X-Box 360, PS3, and a half dozen blu-rays and games on him? Because a TSA employee stole those from me.
0	2	I try to give people the benefit of doubt. I probably shouldn't do that when it comes to government. 
-	-	grape I hope.
-	-	Encrypt everything, remote storage, etc.  Still, bad subreddit choice for submission.
0	2	Evil genius!
0	1	You do know that property gets stolen everyday from other international airports, hotels, taxis.   Even from people's houses ! Gasp. The poor children !  There is no evidence what so ever that there is a systemic problem with theft at the TSA.
-	-	It has NOTHING to do with computers specifically and everything to do with expensive items.  My guess is that the employee would steal jewellery if they were as easy to sell as a computer.
0	2	It's stories like this that make me wish opposing the government was possible.  But not in this country!
-	-	chill out dude...i've posted articles that get downvoted into oblivion, only to see them a few hours later with 1000 points.  :D  Go take a trip somewhere in an exotic place, and then you'll see how worthless these points are in the scheme of life.
-	-	No, they were trying to save themselves the expense of busting up your laptop followed by a claim.
0	2	Wait, you want the government to be in charge of watching the government?  Splendid idea. Perhaps we can have even more government that watches the government that watches the government.  
0	1	Seriously, pack [guns](http://www.vimeo.com/3923535) with your normal belongings and everything is fixed.  Suddenly, the TSA can no longer open your suitcase legally without you being the in the room, so they can fuck off with the requests to know your suitcases passwords.
-	-	Who watches the watchmen?
-	-	Is there any explanation as to why the baggage owners were not charged with Inducement of Larceny Upon a Federal Employee?
1	6	Oh good lord why would you check your computer?
-	-	You can't professionalize unless you federalize!
0	2	Can we get rid of those mouth breathers now? I liked flying better when I didn't have to submit to imbeciles playing dress up.
-	-	Hooray for statism!!! Unintended consequences are still consequences.  
-	-	Of course this was an isolated incident and the TSA is otherwise fool proof.
-	-	This belongs in [/r/tsa](http://tsa.reddit.com/).
0	6	I'm shocked, shocked I tell you!
-	-	The first and second amendments provide avenues for such activity. 
-	-	Many corporations have long recognized that by joining government and regulatory bodies, they can effectively take it over and control it from within.  At the present time, you as a citizen have this same opportunity by taking any government jobs thereby affecting policy from within, or running for any office, even though being at a disadvantage without an abundance of corporate-provided resources.  Just sayin.
1	6	They doing wood carving in the dark?
-	-	[Here's a recent article](http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/24/news/la-trb-tsa-luggage-thefts-20110624) giving a number of TSA employees arrested in the last decade.  Your estimation of once a week is pretty close to spot on.  On average maybe just once a week and a day or so... and that's just the ones that are caught.
-	-	The report identifies the charged man as a former TSA employee, but also says he was caught Monday stealing from a bag. Huh? Was he a former TSA employee caught stealing in the baggage area? Or was he a TSA employee caught stealing on Monday, dismissed and then charged on Thursday with theft?  Most likely he was an employee at the time, dismissed after being caught and a former employee by the time the charge was formally filed. But the shit should not be that easy for TSA to rub off and disassociate itself.  Question of TSA: "Has a TSA employee been charged with stealing from luggage?"  Answer by TSA PR agent: "No. No TSA employee at any time, anywhere has ever been charged with stealing from luggage." (Unsaid: Cause we fired those 666 employees before charges were filed.) "Our record on that is pristine."
1	6	I believe the vast majority of TSA employees, and airline baggage handlers, are honest people. I also believe the vast majority of the passengers boarding planes are honest people, but that does not get us onto the plane without going thru screening and, perhaps, body search.  TSA employees and baggage handlers being no more honest than the general flying public, my question is: Does *every* TSA employee and *every* baggage handler have to go thru a security check (scan and maybe body search) *every* time they report for work in secure zones of an airport? And for extra safety, *every* time they leave a secure zone? (Obvious not on exit, or this guy could not be walking out with stolen stuff.) Who screens the screeners?

0	1	I never said those anecdotes constituted data. I was just providing a citation (not ~500, but enough to show that it happens). Besides, I wouldn't really consider news stories to be anecdotes.  It may not be scientifically rigorous data, but it shows that TSA agents do steal from passengers.   &gt; TSA hate aside, it's hard to blame all of TSA for this.  The TSA is accountable because it's their employees who stole from passengers while on the job. Not only that, but it seems to be a regular occurence. Who else would be to blame other than the TSA?
0	1	"The plural of anecdote is not data"  And ~500? Where the fuck did this number come from? And how many TSA agents are there? That number could be a minuscule fraction of a percentage.
-	-	I agree that it is annoying, but citations are such a key part of the informative dialogue that I will always, always, always post a citation if requested. I do not want to in any way discourage the use or need for citations, nor do I want to allow people with nefarious intentions the cover of "it is annoying to be required to cite my source."

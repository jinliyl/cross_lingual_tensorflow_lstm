-	-	You should not need to use fishy excuses like this.  Fifth amendment is meant to prevent *exactly* this situation -- to allow people to **outright refuse to provide self-incriminating evidence** instead of getting entangled deeper in a web of half-truths which will eventually land them in jail even if they haven't done anything (provably) wrong to begin with.
0	2	That would be perjury if she does in fact remember the password.
-	-	&gt; ...**against unreasonable searches and seizures**, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.  If they have a warrant for the stuff in your TrueCrypt container, they're allowed to search it. Fifth Amendment allows you to refuse to give up the password.
-	-	I think you forgot to finish that man. What was the next part? Oh yeah, **against unreasonable searches and seizures, **.  A search and seizure is not unreasonable when you have probable cause that a crime was committed and you are searching something probably involved in that crime.  I don't think she should have to hand over the password, but I *do* think she should have to hand over the un-encrypted data they are seeking or else be in contempt of court for withholding discovery evidence.  If I attacked someone and made a video of it, and kept that video locked up, making me produce that video wouldn't be a violation of my 5th amendment rights; the video is material evidence, *not* testimony. Similarly, files on the laptop that would prove her guilty are not testimony, they are evidence.   I think she's entitled to have her attorney present to inspect the files on the laptop and to make sure only data possibly related to the case is taken.
1	6	You posted in quotes, what's your source?
-	-	SpiderOak already does this, I think about all that they could give the police is the times and addresses you were connected to the system. Everything is encrypted on the client side before hitting their servers so it's pretty much useless.
-	-	Does Amazon require subpoenas before digging through S3?
0	3	That's the scary thing: they don't have to prove her wrong.  If a court orders her to decrypt the drive and she doesn't; she's in contempt.  Period.  And the judge could jail her for life because of that.
-	-	Rhetorical question: why is that when such kind of technical stuff is discussed, a lot of people pop up with their opinions informed by cyberpunk novels where hackers race cybercycles on the information superhighway?  The information on your hard drive can't magically expire the encryption key. It's information, it can't possibly have any connection to any of the real world parameters, such as time. It's immutable, dead.  Unless you are thinking about a software-hardware solution, which makes it painfully obvious that your refusal to provide a correct unlocking procedure is exactly the same as if you had documents inside of a safe which incinerates its contents when tampered with or when its timer is not properly reset. Which is usually considered to be a contempt of court and is allowed to be used as an incriminating evidence in itself.
-	-	They'd have to have probable cause to believe this book was your bookie records before they could order you to decrypt it.  This isn't carte blanche for the police to just tell you to unencrypt anything, anytime.
0	1	Good luck with that EFF. Over here in the UK and the EU, judges have been falling over themselves making daft analogies as excuse to force people to incriminate themselves.  Edit: [England and Wales Supreme Court. S &amp; Anor, R v 2008](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2008/2177.html)  The Judge said, "The actual answers, that is to say the product of the appellants' minds could not, of themselves, be incriminating. The keys themselves simply open the locked drawer, revealing its contents."  What fucking nonsense.
-	-	"I've been under so much stress lately that I just forgot the password."  Prove her wrong if she says that.
1	4	The best analogy is probably this. Let's say that I'm a suspected bookie, and that I have a book that is indecipherable to anyone and they think I know the code. The book could have anything, it could have family recipes that I didn't want to share, it could have my own personal finances that are completely legitimate, it could have nothing but the finest Brazilian fart porn, it could have all the bets placed through me, or it really could just be random letters typed by a monkey.  The question then is, can I be ordered to decrypt my own book? And if so, if I say that some sections are just random doodling or nonsensical phrases, can I be thrown in jail for not "decrypting" those sections, even though they might not *have* a decryption?
-	-	You get an upvote sir, your words are true and just.
-	-	~~Patriot~~ Fascists Act 
-	-	That's true.  There's long now been a distinguishment between data and intellectual property.  But in some cases, the line certainly could blur.  Your encryption on someone else's IP stored as 'your' data becomes very ambiguous.
1	6	Let's say they've had enough probable cause to arrest you (maybe someone that you may or may not know says they placed bets through you). The question is: Is there any circumstance under which you can be forced to divulge from your own brain the necessary information to reconstruct other information that could incriminate you?
-	-	okay, but none of that is relevant to the fifth amendment.  the fifth amendment doesn't say you are innocent until proven guilty.  i'm not saying there shouldn't be legal safeguards, i'm just saying that the fifth amendment argument fails.
-	-	Can you elaborate? I've not see proof any proof of this other than people claiming they can.
-	-	I don't think you understand the 5th amendment.  A password is something contained inside of your mind. If you think they can compel you to provide them with something contained in your mind, then what you are really saying is you don't think the 5th amendment actually does anything at all. 
-	-	Just like the fifth amendment lets you refuse to give away locations of hidden assets, or lets you refuse to open up a lock box, safe, or safe deposit box.  Except it doesn't.
-	-	A court can force you to open a safe and they can force you to reveal hiding places in some circumstances.  You can't skirt it by forcing them to ask you "the right question."  The right question is "Give us the files in an unencrypted format."  There is no answer to avoiding this or tricking the law.  It's not a method they're demanding of you.  It's a result.
-	-	If they can find and retrieve the evidence on their own fine, but you cannot be compelled to tell them where it is or how to get to it, which is what the password is.
0	2	Me thinks you have no idea what you are talking about.  http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=plausible-deniability
1	4	That's interesting. I live in England and although we have certain rights against self-incrimination it's not the same. Nowhere near as strict.  My own non-legal opinion, I think if there is some kind of probable cause to suspect someone is breaking the law, e.g. someone reports that their company's accounts do not add up properly and the accountant keeps all the documents on his encrypted drive, then it seems to me to be a good idea to order him to allow access to them as part of an investigation. He is not being forced to confess to his crimes as the only witness, because this isn't an interview or a question about his guilt, it's just a set of exhibits really. The crime in saying no might be willingly prohibiting an investigation or the spoliation of evidence?

1	6	I wonder if it is really "prove" or suspect. Because in a court of law, that two very different issues.
-	-	The EFF would make a killing to support their legal bills if they offered a cloud-based encrypted storage service. They would have to subpoena to get the data, and the EFF would tell everyone to go fuck themselves.
-	-	*I don't recall the encryption password I used*  -Alberto Gonzales.
-	-	Huh?  A door lock does not render the inside of a building imperceptible.  In other words, the key is not required to ascertain what's inside.  Providing an encryption password not only unlocks the hard drive, it *reconstructs and authenticates everything on it*.
-	-	Except an encryption key is a thought, not a physical object like a key for unlocking doors.
-	-	I don't think you can be compelled to give a key to a safe, because you can always claim that you've lost it, or forgotten the combination.  And it doesn't matter if you do, because they can simply cut it open.  The problem with encrypted data is if you claim you forgot the key, they can't get at the data, so now if you forget the key they want to presume you are guilty of lying to them about forgetting the key and throw you in jail.  And that violates innocent until proven guilty.
-	-	You had the right choice of words.  It is moot in such a case as a perfectly hidden, encrypted file (I will not cite a specific method because that's up for debate.  Just suppose such a method existed).  The reason it's moot is because the police *can't find that*.  If they can't find it, they cannot get a warrant to search it or a court order for you to decrypt it.  They don't know it exists.  Perfect crimes may still be illegal, but the law is *moot* to them.  They're perfect crimes.  There's no way you can reach a final decision in the debate of their legality.
-	-	No, it's not and yes you can. 
-	-	I've been waiting for more case law on this for a long time. As for admiralteal's comment, I'd just refer to some of what happened during the "crypto wars."   The Government was asserting that software (source or object) was merely an instrumentality or tool, while some sought to demonstrate that publication of software was also an exercise of one's right to speech.   It finally took publication of the PGP source code in a machine-readable font, bound in a book, to throw enough of a wrench in the system for people to realize that some of these positions were untenable. 
-	-	I always assumed that they could request the owner unlock it, but if he refused, the police could just break into it with whatever force necessary. Encryption, however, presents an effectively unbreakable lock, and the courts are trying everything they can to compel the disclosure of keys.
-	-	no.  it isn't.  when the government demands that you provide keys, you can legally not respond at all under the 5th amendment.  the act of providing the key is testimonial in that it is an admission that you have control over the safe and its contents.  in practice, failing to provide the key means the government just breaks in.  this happens regularly.  the problem the government has here is that they can't fall back on breaking in.  it's not mathematically feasible.  even worse, the fact that you're physically capable of responding by saying "i forgot" means it's testimonial.  if it's something that's literally only in the defendant's head, no court  can compel the defendant to give it up.  that is by definition, being forced to provide evidence against yourself.  additionally, just stating "i forgot" further admits control over the computer, because you can't forget a password you don't have.  and even worse than that, what happens if you say "i never had the password, it's not my computer."  now you have the court trying to compel something that may be impossible, and it solely depends on the defendant's word.  this is exactly what the 5th amendment was intended to prevent.  oh, and i'm a lawyer.  i'm not your lawyer, and this is not legal advice.
-	-	Patriot Act trumps all. You cannot even really fight it, it is illegal to report that it was invoked in a lot of cases.
0	3	The problem with this that if I lost key to the safe, or simply refused to open it, they can simply break the lock. With encryption for all intents and purposes this is impossible. And there's no way to know whether the person really does not remember or is simply lying. In this case it would be unfair to ask the defendant to provide something that he is physically unable.
-	-	I stand corrected, you make a compelling argument (you wily lawyer you)... 
-	-	And in that way, it's exactly the same as self-incrimination. You are being forced to testify in a manner that will potentially lead to your incrimination.  
1	4	Yeah, I fully expect the difference between the regulation of thoughts/ideas and objects will start getting very blurry over the next decade.  Take a look at bitcoin for instance, the closest regulatory analog for it is speech, there is no items changing hands between transacting parties, the data doesn't even go directly between them, but to everyone.  Clearly governments will want regulatory power over powerful concepts backed by encryption.
-	-	Can you expand on the point?
-	-	That's because strong cryptography essentially renders nation states on nearly equal footing with their citizens again.  The only power the state has over crypto that the people do not is to make cryptography itself illegal under threat of violence/jailtime which is the effective outcome of the UK legislation.  I fully expect crypto to be made similarly effectively illegal in the US within 5 years.
0	2	oops, I must of glanced over that part.
-	-	It means that they can imprison you indefinitely.  Enjoy your tyranny.
-	-	That is now what I shall claim encrypted goodies on my equipment is, should I ever be in the position where it is necessary to. 
-	-	Except thats obvious you don't have the password to. Its not that hard to show what its from.   Your own personal computer with your own personal files? Its not very likely that you don't have hte passwords. 
-	-	I was just thinking that. I (and I assume tons of people) have a copy of that, as well as other files on my hard drive I cannot decrypt (or cannot legally decrypt like an image of a CSS protected DVD for example). 
	"Our computers now hold years of email with family and friends, Internet browsing histories, financial and medical information, and the ability to access our online services like Facebook. People are right to use passwords and encryption to safeguard this data, and they deserve the law's full protection against the use of it against them"
	I suspect that, like in the EU and UK, the court will rule that it's not self-incrimination.   So what can we do about it? I think the answer is expiring passwords, like the keys to Ambrosia-licensed software (http://www.windowsusers.org/piracy.html). Sure, you'll get yourself thrown in jail for 30 days, but then you cooperate... but your computer won't. Either have a so extraordinarily convoluted scheme for generating a new password that they won't be able to know what to ask to compel you to get it, or just have that be the end of your data.
	Not an expert but I thought it is fairly difficult to get manage a collision to get the same hash. I suppose if you files that sensitive it would be worth the effort.  
	Most of all such evidence ends with a person's router, though, if we're to be at all honest about these things.
	If you could get your encrypted personal files to have the same md5 hash as what is effectively an arbitrary file (Insurance.AES256), you have a solid basis for an amazing career in computer security.
	There are aspects of network traffic originating from the device that get pretty close to your "pot smell" though. There are also ways to characterize that traffic came from a particular device, some more nuanced than just the MAC address of the ethernet adapter (which can be produced by a bunch of other devices at will).
	No, you can't.
	*Suspecting* that you know the password is apparently enough to compel you to give it.
	I don't - hence the fact that I didn't claim to be the origin of the research. Fucking calm down.   I was reading about a person that had been jailed for contempt for three years for not providing the decryption key for a truecrypt volume. They sent it to a forensics firm that somehow deduced that there was another volume, I believe through some sort of entroypical analysis. I'll try to find the article when I get home.
	Electron microscopy amongst other things.
	Probable cause has an exact, legal, definition. British laws of self-incrimination aren't quite the same as the context of the 5th Amendment.
	There's a big difference between the robustness of an algorithm and the details of implementation, which includes all manner of variables, potentially including everything from hardware brand to temperature.   The TrueCrypt people have thought of a lot of things, but so did the designers of many other people who thought their products were impenetrable.   It's all about work factor and key management, people.
	a.  i don't see this going well for the EFF as it winds its way through the court system.  b.  i'm not sure that it should.  this seems far more akin to being compelled to give the key to a safe for which the government has a warrant to search.  if you look at the foundations of the fifth amendment, it seems pretty clear that the instant case is distinct from the sorts of self-incrimination the authors were concerned about.  (see http://www.slate.com/id/2061972/). 
	Isn't all of this basically rendered moot by hidden truecrypt containers? You cannot prove their existence.
	Well not really...  This is more akin to providing the keys to a safe or a filing cabinet...
	but it violates patriot act  if you are not a us citizen, you are fucked 
	What if the password itself is self-incriminating, like "Thebodie$areinthecellar420"?
	If the police get a warrant to search a locked building, couldn't the court compel its owner to unlock it?  The analogy to decryption keys and passwords seems relevant.
	I've been predicting a case like this to hit the docket... 4 years ago.  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-9834495-38.html  &gt;A federal judge in Vermont has ruled that prosecutors can't force a criminal defendant accused of having illegal images on his hard drive to divulge his PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) passphrase.  &gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerome Niedermeier ruled that a man charged with transporting child pornography on his laptop across the Canadian border has a Fifth Amendment right not to turn over the passphrase to prosecutors. The Fifth Amendment protects the right to avoid self-incrimination. 
	I love how everybody's forgetting the fact that the 5th Amendment doesn't apply in the United Kingdom.
	I was just about to mention this.   The interesting thing is always "what you know, and when you know it".  If the government has certain knowledge an cryptic volume has content of such and such ... that is incriminating, due to expert testimony, etc..   I've seen other stuff about contempt of court when blocking the process of discovery by withholding a pass. Going to jail for contempt of court sucks when it seems so clear it's a 5th amendment issue.
	Well, I've been predicting a case like this to hit the dockets for 20 years.  Here it is. 
	"Its decrypted Your Honour, i just like to keep 100GB of random noise on my hdd."
	&gt; Fifth Amendment allows you to refuse to give up the password.  Maybe. SCOTUS will go out of their way to re-interpret this issue, and judging by their track record lately...
	The point is that the warrant needs to be specific as to what data on the hard drive it wants to look at. In that context, it is pretty clear that a blank check to riffle through her emails, family pictures and years of other personal data is unconstitutional. 
	What about Insursance.Aes256 - the encrypted file wikileaks spread without giving the password to? Would that mean someone could go to jail for life if the SCOTUS rules that one must give up all their passwords when under investigation and they have a file like this which can't be decrypted?
	It's relevant because both our countries are common law, the 5th being your version (if an American) in jurisprudence on the right to silence and the right against self-incrimination. It's also relevant because, no doubt, the same arguments will be made in court.
	The article we all just read? https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2011/07/08
	Isn't that like saying "they can't force you admit to murder, but they can lock you up if you don't produce the location of a body"
	Given the current state of the law, that's probably the one case where I believe the defendant would be in the best position. I'm not sure what their attorney could do to substantiate the fact without making matters worse, however. 
	The police have a warrant, they can open themselves.  But if I say, memorize the code for a sealed container, that they can't open. They can't compel me to open it unless I let them compel me because they're limited in what they can do to compel me.  Encryption however is special because it's legislated for, everyone in the UK has been told, refusal in and of itself is a crime.  Doesn't mean you have to open the container though, just what the maximum thing they can do to compel you is. 3 years in prison is it.
	this is true, and I thought as you did, until someone extended the analogy for me.  If you have a safe locked with a key, the police can demand the key.  If it's locked with a code, they cannot demand you tell them the code, because that could be self-incrimination.  Thus, according to existing precedent, people shouldn't be compelled to disclose encryption codes or passwords.  (still talking about the UK btw)
	Well, myself and others on Reddit have been predicting a case like this to hit the dockets for about a year.  Here it is.  Expect this case to go all the way to the SCOTUS, regardless of how the judge rules in this case.  The losing side will appeal; guaranteed.  And expect the Obama administration to weigh in heavily in favor of the prosecution on this one.  At least the EFF knows what's at stake here.  ~~Oh, and please don't bring up the *US v Boucher* case.  It has no applicability here~~ (EDIT: OK, that's a bit marginalizing.  It's of interest to discussion, but in the Boucher case, the govt already knew there were incriminating files on the computer and Boucher cooperated with them).
	**The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,...**
	I don't think I can agree with this, as much as I'd like to.  As I can see it, you can compare encryption to one of two things.  Either it's a very sophisticated method of hiding something, or it's a way of locking it up.  A warrant\* can force you to open up a lock box for the police already, and a warrant\* can cover the police's right to search your property (and your hiding places) already.  A court can order you to reveal the location of hidden assets already too.  I don't really see what's special about encryption that cannot force you to surrender the information.  It's not self-incrimination.  You aren't incriminating yourself, you're just turning over evidence.  The incrimination has already happened, since the police already have a warrant.  Any evidence found which has nothing to do with the case the warrant was issued for would be inadmissible in any court, so there's no real danger of tertiary incrimination.  At least not according to the law.  The only justification for treating it differently would be as a matter of public policy because the law would, in practice, never get fully and properly obeyed.  I guess I'd be OK with such a decision, but is that really the EFF's argument?  edit: also, this brings up a lot of questions about how a file can be property.  How long until we start admitting that data isn't necessarily property of the person who possesses the storage device?  How can you prove an encrypted file belongs to a specific person?  Our IP law already seems to claim data can somehow "not belong to you," so why can this not protect you too?  Eh.  edit2: I type warranty too much for my job.  It is now muscle memory.
	I'll try to find the post; I believe it was on the SA forums. Basically, they were able to perform some sort of entropy analysis and prove there was another volume. 
	Oh in the case of third-party provider it becomes a real morass and very difficult to have confidence in the protection of the data.   It's not just the difference between intellectual property and data, the key distinction is between something that *does something* and simple "information."
	I think I've posted this before somewhere, but here it goes again.   Sure, they can force me to decrypt my hard drive. But what if I plug a powerful pulsing electromagnet on top of my hard drive, connected to a device to detect if my computer case was opened, and an accelerometer to detect things such as my case being moved. Add to that a battery system inside the case itself to keep the whole rig powered if the power is cut beforehand (unlikely).   Now, you have this scenario, cops knock down your door, all you have to do is turn off your computer. You get arrested, they call in someone to collect the equipment, and as soon as they pick it up, the electromagnet kicks in for as long as the batteries can support it working, effectively degaussing your hard drive.   Was it destruction of evidence? Or could you claim you did it because that information was very sensitive and you didn't want thieves getting their hands on it if they stole your computer?
	I don't think you understand what I wrote. I never said she had to give them the password, I said she had to produce the evidence. I think its fine if they give her the computer and let her unlock it without divulging the password.   The fifth amendment protects you from having to testify, it does not allow you to refuse to produce evidence that the court specifically compels production of.  Mind you, I don't think it's appropriate for the court to compel production of the entire computer and everything on it. I think they need to be asking for very specific documents, and I think the defendant's attorney is the one who should be going through the computer with his client and deciding what is appropriate for a production request.
	Fingers crossed...
	If you do that, make sure it came from diode noise or radioactive decay. Anything else risks being shown to be non random if a well-funded adversary really cared. 
	Deniability FTW.
	...again, what part of "jail until you refrain from being in contempt of court" don't you understand?  It's the modern day equivalent of the Spanish inquisition killing those they tortured into confessions and then conversion.  All of this legal witchdoctor entrail reading will be rendered moot once the federal government figures out how to extract passwords via neurological simulation and imaging (think two way MRI)
	In order for probable cause to be applicable there must be extant evidence of incriminating information on the drive in question.  There is no equivalent of "I smell pot on the other side of this door" or "I looked inside the window". Ergo, there cannot be -- absent these -- *probable cause* for issuing a warrant demanding access to the property in question.    Furthermore; if there **is** the possibility of incriminating evidence being present on a drive (and let's face it; nowadays pretty much everything you can do is a crime somewhere) -- then the 5th amendment preserves you against being required to take actions that incriminate you.  In other words; you'd be required to hand over the hard-drive, but not to provide the password.  If they had the warrant, they could always decrypt the drive if you refused to give password... but that doesn't mean your failure to provide the password is somehow a crime.  At least, that's how *I* understand the 4th-and-5th Amendment's relevance here.

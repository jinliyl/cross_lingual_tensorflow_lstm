0	2	I do not shop at a grocery store without a self checkout... period. It seems like a dumb move to remove these when they can both coexist just fine.  Don't like having to figure them out? Don't use it.
0	2	I hope that doesn't become a trend, I actually like the self checkout. They're great when I just want to buy a candy bar or an iced coffee and don't feel like waiting behind someone who's doing their entire week's shopping.

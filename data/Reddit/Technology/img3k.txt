1	-	If it wasn't used, the delay wouldn't have occurred. Yes, it delayed Iran only 6 months, but it wouldn't have happened any other way. Plus, it is sort of a show of force to whoever programmed it, testing that it can indeed be done. 
0	2	&gt;the middle east is the last place anyone should want or encourage nuclear armament.  [Too late.](http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/nuke/)
-	-	Except that PCS7 installations are specially customized when installed and the virus here targeted a very specific set of circumstances that were later found to exist *only* at this plant.
1	6	That sounds like a pretty good deal to me
1	7	The second half of that I was not aware of; thank you for the clarification.  I do have a follow-up question though: would it have been possible to make minor changes to the virus to enter into other utilizations of the software?
1	4	That is an excellent point.  - and the following post then offered further clarity as well (post by Magcius)  I'm guessing based on this - that the whole point of this virus was to stop or slow down Iran's nuclear proliferation.   I'm also guessing that this was the creation of some superpower, the work of the CIA or some such clandestine organization...  makes me wonder what's out there that HASN'T been found...there are some very smart people in the world and given their aptitude, their passion and a butt-ton of funding there's no knowing what they could create... 
0	1	not to be a jingoist jerk here but.... they successfully cleaned up a virus that allowed Iran to continue building nuclear weapons?  I don't think that was a good outcome.  I'm not very relieved.  In fact -I'm all for reinfecting their systems...  the middle east is the last place anyone should want or encourage nuclear armament.
0	2	This is what I don't get.  The virus was designed to be delivered to systems that are not connected to the internet, but then it tried to download content/instructions from the CC servers?  It would also try and grab compromised dll's for the Siemens Software.
1	4	Fascinating stuff, I'd love to hear what's in those last encrypted files. 
-	-	From the article: &gt;In this case, the exploit allowed the virus to cleverly spread from one computer to another via infected USB sticks. Edit:  Plus the Print Spooler expoit.  and &gt;It appeared the attackers were targeting systems they knew were not connected to the internet.
-	-	&gt;It was a messy and imprecise method of attack — a little like infecting one of Osama bin Laden’s wives with a rare virus, hoping she’d pass it to the Al Qaeda leader. It was bound to infect others beyond the target, increasing the chance that the plot would be discovered.  Zing!
-	-	I honestly feel like Stuxnet was a failure.  It only set back Iran 6 months.  It probably took that much in R&amp;D.
-	-	Designed to move slowly within the plant and update when it gets a chance 
-	-	&gt; The virus was designed to be delivered to systems that are not connected to the internet.  Not true. The virus was designed to run on a Windows PC such as a maintenance laptop. The virus would then wait until it was connected to a specific Siemens PLC and then deliver it's payload.
-	-	They didn't know that until it was cleaned up though
0	2	The only problem with that logic is that PCS7 controls systems are* utilized in very disparate (and global) industries from brewing to oil services and everything in between.    To not neutralize the threat could have meant derivative programs being used to wipe out large-scale manufacturing, exploitation and service.  Personally, I wouldn't want to see those effects--no matter how much I'd like to see Iranian nuclear power/potential weaponization stopped.    It's just like the ACLU standing up for neo-nazis; we may not agree with the point, but any reduction in efficacy of the system is dangerous for the rest.  *EDIT:  Revision for grammatical clarity.  Sorry for the error.

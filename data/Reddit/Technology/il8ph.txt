-	-	I'd agree if Google was just dreaming up random stuff to patent in the hopes that it'll become a reality some day for patent squatting purposes. But AFAIK, they aren't.
1	4	I don't think this is why they hoard all the patents in the first place. They need all the patents since they have really broad interests - they are doing everything so they need patents to defend it. Trolling Android is probably just the icing on the cake.  Just more evidence that the patent thing is stupid. Id rather both parties used the money to actually make something useful.
1	-	Yes, patent law is the root cause of the issue, but that doesn't excuse M$ from exploiting it.
-	-	You also have to understand that patents are more than just the vague abstract put up by most tech blogs. "Gesturing to unlock screen" is much more than those words. Actual patents are pages long, with plenty of legalese to make things extra specific.
1	-	If they threw away software patents I would go out of business. My company is an 'innovator' as well. Throwing out the patent system would be a boon and a curse for Microsoft. They would lose much of their IP, but they'd also be able to squash me instead of partenering with me.   In all honesty, there is faar too much personification of companies in this subreddit. I've worked with almost all of the top 10 tech companies and they are pretty much interchangeable. Google has tried to screw me over just as many times as MS or Apple or HP or Oracle.   If Google had the 20+ years of patent portfolios that MS has they'd be doing the same thing. 
0	2	[I haven't downvoted you](http://i.imgur.com/DQo8y.jpg)  But you're wrong. MS puts out way too many products to be considered a patent troll, especially if they've had a smartphone OS for years before Android even existed, in any incarnation.
1	7	I read it for myself, thanks. That doesn't actually explain what patents Microsoft claims are being infringed on.
-	-	I would like to know how having a OS written by 3rd parties means you have to pay to develop a device that runs said OS.
-	-	Probably only because they lack the patents to do so.
-	-	IMHO patent law is more to blame than Microsoft.  Is it morally right?  Probably not, but major corporations aren't usually shining beacons of moral integrity.
-	-	&gt; When corporation A sues corporation B it would be insane for corporation C to get involved.  ...except that happens all the time. Providing patent indemnification across your products isn't exactly uncommon. And it's a little known fact that (perhaps ironically) Microsoft itself provides a broad patent indemnity across its products so that if the roles were reversed (Google suing OEMs for using Windows), MS would defend you in court and pay your fees.
-	-	No, patent trolling is when you hold patents and have no intentions of producing anything with those patents, and only seek to sue.
1	4	Makes sense.
-	-	&gt;But seriously, either you can pay MS $1,000 to use a supposed patent  it's not a thousand. They are asking 15 dollar per phone form samsung. That's millions of dollars a day.
0	3	&gt; M$  What is this, fifth grade recess?  &gt; I think this could be solved by dismissing software patents entirely, or atleast requiring them to be more specific. I think it's stupid that you can own a patent on an idea.  The patent system needs to be reformed, certainly, but I think throwing it out completely might be a bit extreme. The idea behind patents seems okay (encourage innovation and research by giving inventors exclusive rights for a while), it's just that the current system is horribly broken.
-	-	But they're also defending patents like a legitimate company would. The difference between a patent troll and a legitimate company is that one actually puts those patents to use. 
0	1	Bullshit...  The only thing that comes close was a unit test that was linked to in the build that was never used.  The check in comments even read that someone removed it as soon as they found it.
-	-	Google doesn't need patents in this case. LG does.
0	1	eat a butt
-	-	Well, except for the case of Google willfully and continually violating Oracle patents in its implementation of Java on Android...  EDIT: Sources please?! If you are so upset over the error in this statement, please set me straight! I'd truly like to know.
0	6                                                                           	Because that's how the patent system works. It's silly, I know.  I'm actually kinda surprised that Google hasn't jumped in to defend itself here. They're just kinda letting Microsoft run amok amongst their hardware manufacturers. I know that, for example, Microsoft itself provides a [binding patent indemnity](http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/D/0/9D0A6265-A509-416C-80AE-BB6C0A9D1B99/IP%20Indemnification%20Policy.docx) on all of their products - so if you get sued for using a Microsoft product, they'll defend you in court and pay your legal fees. I'm really surprised that Google doesn't have a similar policy in place.
1	-	I know for a fact they would. They tried to do it to me and then they tried to outlawyer me too. 
0	8	Ironically Microsoft is one of the largest and most vocal proponents of sweeping patent reforms to eliminate exactly this kind of behaviour in the industry. The money Microsoft makes from patent licenses is dwarfed by the license fees that Microsoft pays to other people. In the end they lose a far more money due to the patent system than they gain - which is why they're in this strange position of suing (and being sued) while trying to push patent reforms.
-	-	The title sounds like Microsoft invented something. They didn't. It's business as usual in Patentland. The same IBM was already doing to Sun in the 1980s.
0	1	Microsoft is being a bastard, no mistake, but it's definitely worth noting Google is showing no interest in defending its partners in this. Nor it's developers in that Lodsys thing, come to that. Google's taking the rewards and ducking responsibility.
-	-	Sounds more like a comment than an actual article about how this is happening. 
-	-	Microsoft makes more money off Android than their own phones. Being a troll pays. http://blogs.computerworld.com/18370/microsofts_biggest_mobile_money_maker_is_android_not_windows_phone_7
-	-	With the patent disputes that rocked the tech world in the early 90's, Apple and Microsoft have learned the hard way that patenting anything and everything is absolutely necessary to hold on to your R&amp;D's value.  The line of reasoning in the article is speculative ("MS has more patents BECAUSE they want to patent troll") and paper-thin. I've read more informative posts in the comments section of Engadget.
1	4	Cool article, bro.  Now they should write one entitled "How Google games the patent system to expand its business".  Google:  "Oh hey Oracle... Nice Java technology you have there."  Oracle:  "Yup, sure is.  Would you like to license it?"  Google:  "No.  But wouldn't it be a shame if somebody looked at your code, typed it up in a slightly different way, and claimed ownership of this new code?"  Oracle:  "Well.. you can't do that.  We designed and created all this.  You can't just copy it and claim it's yours"  Google:  "Oh no?  Technically we can as long as we don't actually copy and paste your code.  And technically correct is the best kind of correct..." 
0	2	The article doesn't explain "how".... :(
0	2	They should seriously proof read their articles. Two paragraphs in, 3 errors.
-	-	Microsoft bad, Google good.  It's not that simple.
-	-	In this case, Microsoft is evil for abusing patents, and Google is good for not abusing patents and for actually creating products of value.  In general, of course Microsoft also does good things and Google also does bad things. 
0	1	Because fuck you, that's why.  But seriously, either you can pay MS $1,000 to use a supposed patent, or get sued and pay tens of thousands in legal fees potentially bankrupting your entire company if you try and fight it; regardless whether or not you win. Or maybe end up settling out of court for $5,000 since you woke up MS's lawyer army and didn't pay up in the first place. It's just not worth the effort.  "Legal" bullying. Plain and simple.  It's exactly like mafia owned neighborhoods and cities back in the day. Anyone could set up a shop in the area if they wanted to, but if they didn't pay a "security" fee every month some terrible "accident" would be befall the store and its owner.
-	-	Sorry, I was just enjoying a bit of sarcasm in my reply there, but yeah, exactly what Bluescreen said.  Just roll the dice and pick a one or two out of that 18,000. 
1	4	Congratulations, you've discovered what blogs are.
-	-	Microsoft had 22 years of operation when Google didn't even exist.  They have fielded at least 29 major releases of new products over the life of the company: DOS (6), Windows (10+), OS/2 (1, abandoned), Development Suites (at least 4), SDKs, DDKs and APIs (God only knows), XBox (2), Zune (1), phone/mobile (4).  That's what forms the basis of its patent stable.  Google's products, by contrast, leverage a great deal of IP that they did not create (via fee-based licensing, open source). It is fundamentally un-shocking that Microsoft has far more patents, because they have far more inventions to defend.  Are some of them speculative?  You bet.  You can't name a single tech company in the Fortune 500 -- or many schools of engineering nowadays -- that doesn't do the exact same thing with ideas generated internally.  Since Google does not charge for Android, they leave implementers open to liabilities for patent infringement.  That's the cost of a "free" phone OS, and Google set it up that way for a reason - they don't want that liability.  I'm sure these manufacturers will end up paying multiple parties in the end, including Apple, Microsoft, HP, and other tech heavies for use of their patents.  Like it or not, there is value in ideas on paper - just ask [ARM Holdings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Holdings).  You are correct that this is really no different than patent infringement claims that were brought throughout the 80s and to the present day.  Cisco might sue 3Com, then 3Com would countersue, all the relevant patents would be thrown on the table, a cross-licensing scheme would be hatched, and the company with the less impressive portfolio would cut a check.  Problem solved.  The issue with smaller players like LG is that they have no patents of their own with which to assert counterclaims.  All they have is money, so they will pay.   Edit: Forgot Ultimate Television, WebTV.
-	-	&gt;The line of reasoning in the article is speculative ("MS has more patents BECAUSE they want to patent troll") and paper-thin.  I think what they're doing to Android device manufacturers is the textbook **definition** of patent trolling.  EDIT:  If you're going to downvote, you could atleast offer your dissenting opinion.
0	1	&gt;Microsoft is being a bastard, no mistake, but it's definitely worth noting Google is showing no interest in defending its partners in this.   They are not "partners". They use an open source OS developed and mostly maintained by google.  When corporation A sues corporation B it would be insane for corporation C to get involved.  &gt;Google's taking the rewards and ducking responsibility.  They have no responsibility. Microsoft has to be held responsible for their actions.
-	-	Here you go:  "Auditing 10 million lines of code for compliance with 18,000 patents is an impossible task—especially because the meaning of a patent's claims are often not clear until after they have been litigated."  They pay without knowing if they really are violating patents because the only way to really find out is to litigate the matter.
-	-	Assuming:  * Cost of "licensing" A * Cost of getting sued B * Chance of getting sued C  If A &lt; B*C then it is most economic for the manufacturer to pay for the "licensing".
1	-	Sure, but there are gradients and differences worth talking about. Saying "it's not simple" adds very little to the discussion.
-	-	Of course it's not. But atleast google isn't trying to get a free ride off of the success of a competing platform by throwing it's legal weight around.
-	-	&gt; All they have is money  Can't they buy a patent portfolio?  
-	-	this is correct. a troll is typically just a holding company which purchases either patents or copyrights for the sole purpose of licensing or seeking infringement damages. they usually do not develop or produce anything with the patents or copyrights that they hold. nor are they the typical creator or inventor.
-	-	Yeah he's just rationalizing. Google creates an OS that heavily infringes on others IP and then just releases it as 'Open Source' and somehow it's ok.   It's not. In the business world this is not ok. When these companies get sued for using a product google supports and distributes it's not ok for them to not defend their clients. 
-	-	[Nope](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/02/us-dealtalk-nortel-google-idUSTRE76104L20110702).  But they also are hedging their bets on the USPTO doing the very-reasonable thing and cracking down on these broad, untenable method patents.
1	6	Ooh I hit on a touchy subject apparently.  So you're saying Android no longer uses Java at all? They are not using wholesale code nor have they made derivative versions?   And [this](http://www.fetxin.com/2011/06/17/oracle-requires-billions-of-google-for-violating-patents-in-android/) isn't true? &gt;[T]here is evidence that Google indeed large pieces of Java code used. There was that Google has 44 source files directly inherited from Java. 37 of them are marked with ‘ Proprietary/Confidental “and” Do not distribute ‘. Google used them anyway and now has a big problem.  All I really know is what the law blogs are reporting and there hasn't been reports of much of a defense mounted by Google. Plus Google's attempts to conceal info from the lawsuit from the public seems a little fishy.  And there's been more recently. You can see what top IP lawyers and professors are saying about another aspect of Android [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/edward-j-naughton/googles-android-contains-_b_836697.html) and [here](http://www.ipinfoblog.com/archives/licensing-law-issues-infringement-and-disclosure-risk-in-development-on-copyleft-platforms.html).   All I was pointing out is that the statement "Google is good for not abusing patents and for actually creating products of value," may not be completely accurate.  In creating Android, Google has borrowed heavily and doesn't seem to always follow the proper licensing procedures.
1	4	With the absurd nature of tech related patents now-a-days, you don't really need to. MS probably just grabs a vague sounding patent, like "Method for an integrated driver to page memory when rendering UI elements" and see if it sticks.  What MS is showing is, even if you don't have a patent, you can just threaten them and make an easy $1 billion/year.
0	2	I'm not saying MS doesn't produce anything, in fact, someone else brought up that same point, and I conceded that MS does produce alot of stuff. But even so, it looks like they're exploiting patent law the same way a patent troll would.
1	4	&gt;I don't think this is why they hoard all the patents in the first place. They need all the patents since they have really broad interests - they are doing everything so they need patents to defend it. Trolling Android is probably just the icing on the cake.  I agree entirely. Doesn't make me any less hateful toward M$, though. They're being the bully in this situation beyond any doubt.  &gt;Just more evidence that the patent thing is stupid.  I think this could be solved by dismissing software patents entirely, or atleast requiring them to be more specific. I think it's stupid that you can own a patent on an idea.
0	2	That is a valid point. I don't know what patents are involved, nor do I know what Microsoft intends to so with said patents.  But this still rubs me the wrong way. I already dislike MS, and google for that matter, but I dislike google a whole lot less than MS.
0	2	Without knowing what patents are involved, I can't say if you're right or wrong, but I'll still say that I dislike MS more for pulling this stunt.
1	7	&gt;I read it for myself, thanks. That doesn't actually explain what patents Microsoft claims are being infringed on.  That's a secret. Microsoft makes them sign agreements keeping it a secret.
0	2	&gt;What is this, fifth grade recess?  I don't know about you, but patent laws and whatnot were a little beyond me when I was in 5th grade.  &gt;The patent system needs to be reformed, certainly, but I think throwing it out completely might be a bit extreme.   I agree with the sentence that follows this one, but right now, software patents can be granted for something as vague as "A method for viewing copyrighted content from a cloud storage service", and that needs to change.  I think someone should be able to own an implementation of a particular idea, [but to be granted a patent on something as broad as a particular mathematical equation is absurd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka4L0jGF_-Q&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=182s)
	I thought as much. Do no evil my ass. Any further info on what they tried to screw you out of?

1	4	Apple plans to eventually roll out a music upgrade service.  This service would take poor-quality low-bitrate MP3s and attempt to upgrade them to higher quality OGG or similar files (some Apple-preferred format that isn't FLAC) through the cloud by identifying them / matching their meta data / some other kind of automatic process.  I suspect this is the reason they got those licenses, not just pure caution.
0	2	I hardly listen to new music because there are so many hoops to jump through. I'll listen to some songs through YouTube, but thats it, no more giving money to these guys.
1	4	Legal or illegal, the method Amazon and Google are trying to pass isn't forward thinking at all. They tried to pull the old trick of being the first one to the game, but clearly that doesn't work when you have to negotiate with such an uptight industry (music).  It's too soon to say for sure, but it looks like Apple is tackling this in the best way possible. Scan your music library, upgrade lower quality songs to 256k, make library available to your devices.  I haven't tried Amazon or Google, but depending on the size of your music library, you'll be spending day after day uploading before you can sync. The cost from uploading my 100GB+ of music would put my Internet bill at over $200 for one month. iTunes Match is $25 a year.

1	4	Its safe to say any Apple provided file would be ACC. 
1	4	I find myself using streaming services more and more. Pandora, XM, etc. Mainly because I'm not picky enough that I have to listen to a certain song at a given time, especially with all the legality issues. It's just not worth it.
1	4	Yeah, that's what apple uses for itunes songs.
1	6	AAC?  That could be it.

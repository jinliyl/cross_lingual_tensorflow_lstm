-	-	My brother just bought a 3 bed, 2 bath for $130. I'd say that's pretty cheap. The only expensive stuff is down in South Beach
0	6	&gt; Are you on drugs?  Yes, how so?
-	-	Where? Certainly nowhere where there's people.
0	6	Anyone else not see the Florida&lt;--&gt;New York connection?  I did see a Florida&lt;--&gt;New England connection.  Maybe I am reading the map incorrectly.

-	-	It's not just old Jewish parents, it's a lot of folks that retire from New York to Florida.  A lot of kids I went to high school with now live in Florida and I'm only in my 40s.  I never understood the appeal myself.
0	6	Cheap real estate? In florida?  Are you on drugs?
-	-	It's probably the cheap real estate. Consider that $150K can get you a nice house with a yard. In NY, that's barely a down payment on a shitty condo.

1	4	OpenVPN is amazingly powerful, but can be tricky to setup.  There are many guides on the internet, and this is one of the better ones.  It is so flexible, I have a setup with a customer that has multiple locations and multiple roaming employees.  A single OpenVPN server running within a router handles both the router to router (and full communication between each network) connections of remote offices and roaming users at same time.  the clients are set to resolve-retry infinite, so as long as they have internet, they all have main office connection, and roaming users that switch connections (LAN to wireless/mobile) are able to reconnect without user intervention (the number of calls I used to have to deal with because the laptop refused to reconnect to other VPN types, never get calls anymore)  I have setup IPSEC, PPTP tunels, and even Linksys vpn client, and none of them were as stable as OpenVPN in terms of flexibility and easy of management once setup (never have to touch it again, and if a router dies, just paste back configuration and back up again)  also, found openvpn communications to be faster and smoother than other methods, just be sure to use UDP

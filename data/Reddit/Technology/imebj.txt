1	6	Did you read the article?  &gt;With foreign adversaries continuing to improve their radar capabilities and air defense networks, and terrorists worldwide using modern consumer electronics to trigger explosives, the United States is spending billions of dollars in a massive effort to respond. These jammers, for instance, spew radio waves and emit other electromagnetic noise to jumble enemy electronic signals.
1	4	This is all cool, but I think US is still keep ignoring the fact that its current enemies are not using advance technology at all. They use old school, but effective weapons like AK-47 and IDE explosives. Send their messages using birds or just human messengers, and operate in small independent groups. So I don't think those kind of advance electronic warfare help against insurgents in middle east.

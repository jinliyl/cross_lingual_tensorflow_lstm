0	3	&gt;The company later issued a statement claiming that if a human were behind the wheel, they would have noticed the collision-avoidance system wasn't working and taken the appropriate action.  Are they implying that these systems being developed are meant to be relied upon by the driver!? I am terrified that this should be something to advertise even and rather have it just as a secondary safety system.  I wonder how many will test it out and crash right into their neighbor's car.

0	2	Jealous of an incredibly unstable "currency"? Of a currency where the main trading point, based on a card game exchange, went down harder than your mother on a cock covered in ranch sauce? I don't think so. This month you claim it paid for your rent, next month it'll pay for a slim jim.  If you've managed to scam some retards, good on you, if you think it's anything approaching a viable currency then I truly pity you. You might want to throw in a u mad bro or something like that you retarded whore.
1	4	I sent them a bitcoin donation, and they gave it away. They'll not be getting any more of my money.
0	2	This case is important to your wallet. Send the EFF a donation to help them protect your rights.

0	1	&gt;I sent them a bitcoin donation, and they gave it away   Care to explain?
1	4	Thanks for the explanation.   Found this link:  https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/06/eff-and-bitcoin   If I can afford it, I will make a donation in your name - how much was it?
0	2	They started accepting bitcoin donations, then decided they didn't want to anymore, and sent all the bitcoin donations they had recieved to the bitcoin faucet, which gives bitcoins away to people new to bitcoin.
1	4	Thanks for the outstanding donation.  A little too much for my wallet currently, though I will go $25 today ( I did give them $100 earlier in the year ).   Let me know what name you want it under.   Hopefully other redditors ( y spellcheck this word reddit, y? ) will step up for the balance.
0	2	At the time, about $250 in bitcoins. Now? About $100 worth.
1	4	That monopoly money paid my rent last month.   Jealous much?
1	4	&gt;Thanks for the outstanding donation.  He made a donation in monopoly money, your $25 are worth infinitely more than those pretend fairy internet bucks so don't feel bad.

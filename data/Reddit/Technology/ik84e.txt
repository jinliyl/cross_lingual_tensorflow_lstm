-	-	Start your own ISP.
-	-	Stop using the internet in masse.
-	-	...When you're paying for hosting you usually are charged money. 
-	-	That's not totally clear. The big players will be able to cover the additional transit costs, for instance by making agreements with ISPs to forward their traffic for less by giving them big monthly payments. It's the smaller upstarts that will have a higher barrier to market entry that should be concerning to consumers but welcomed by the googles and netflixes. When more companies get on board with this, I think you can start kissing innovation goodbye. No way YouTube would have stood a chance in such an environment.
-	-	The practice of capping is not particularly anti-competitive. It's a different market, that's all. More like buying petrol, water or electicity instead of...  Uh...  Is there anything else which is unlimited? At all?
-	-	Yes and no. If the ISP is a media company also there is a chance that they have a similar service for video on demand and by making their service not count on your bandwidth total they can lock out external services.
-	-	Form an ISP co-op.
-	-	Lower the barriers to new startups.  
0	5	I would feel sorrier for the poor ISPs if the government wasn't handing out billions of dollars in grants for broadband development, and if Comcast didn't just report 9% increase in profits in May, and AT&amp;T wasn't reporting profit gains.  These companies aren't hurting by any stretch.  They just know that in many cases, customers really don't have a choice. Fuck these ISPs. Fuck every last one of them.
-	-	&gt; Bottom line I think we need to find alternate ways to overcome these issues.  How about use some of the $32B the telecos were given by the tax payers for actually upgrading equipment instead of for executive bonus money.  Once they did that, they became nationalized in my opinion. They took that money over a 4 year period and did NOTHING but build up other services (more channels on the television, buying up content companies, minor software adjustments to network routers).
0	1	This is a clear case of a monopolies imposing anticompetitive practices that hurts the buying power of the consumer.  Yet the FTC is investigating Google for setting the default browser to their engine, something that can be changed to a variety of choices by customers. The FCC's commissioner leaves to take a job at Comcast 2 weeks after approving their NBC merger? What are they seeing that I don't?
-	-	ISPs should pay websites for the bandwidth they consume.
-	-	There's nothing inherently wrong about usage-based or cap-based billing, as long as you have enough competition or regulation to keep prices in line with actual costs.  EDIT: Well, this is the first time I've been accused of astroturfing for a foreign telco, so that's something. UBB is the symptom, not the actual problem.
1	4	Totally agree.  I routinely use 750GB a month from Comcast without any issues.  As long as the prices remain low, why does it matter HOW they decide to charge you.  maybe people who only use their internet to check their email and play a couple games dont feel like they should have to pay as much as people who use TBs per month downloading and seeding.  You're right though, resistance on reddit is futile
0	6	Internet service in Australia is good? First time I've heard that.
-	-	But a cap will be a cap. I assume that they are calculating on your gateway and not capping certain bandwidth. Which means it affects all players equally. 
0	1	Nice try, government shill.
-	-	The usual practice in Australia is that you pay $X per month for Y gigabytes per month. Once you go over, your download speed is reduced to 128-256 kbps for the rest of the month, but you are not charged for the extra data. Alternatively, you can head over to your ISP's website and buy a few more gigabytes (at an inflated rate) that will last until the end of the month.
0	1	Let's not forget the shit that Comcast pulls like charging $99 a month for TV, Phone and Internet but if you don't want their TV and Phone you have to pay $89 a month for the same Internet.
-	-	[I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Dave.](http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/07/telco-wont-install-fiber-sues-to-keep-city-from-doing-it.ars)
0	6	Isn't this was all antitrust laws are designed to forbid?
0	2	the government would really really appreciate that
-	-	Is there a good source of information available for how to do this?
0	2	When I pay my Home phone bill I get to talk as long as I want. Data is dirt cheap; it's a fact.
-	-	In order to cap they should have to provide 100% ability/competency in blocking ad and website refresh data or not counting it.  Also updates must be free or easily applied not over the air. otherwise per/packet is a load. 
-	-	[deleted]
-	-	&gt;Cable television programming is quite arguably just as much of an inexhaustible resource as content delivered via the Internet.  Cable television isn't charged based on usage either.  If your argument is the # of channels, these are certainly *not* an inexhaustible resource.  Each channel costs the providers millions of dollars.  &gt;The resources that make data delivery possible (copper, electricity, silicon) themselves dictate the supply.  No, they don't.  They determine maximum throughput, which already has a tiered pricing model.  The data itself is infinite in supply.  If the problem is that the ISPs don't really have the capacity to give me a 25Mbit line, then they *shouldnt sell it to me in the first place*.
1	4	Internet service is shit in Australia currently but the upcoming government funded national broadband network has some real potential.  I'll take my uncapped "no competition" 50 Mbps American Internet access over the average Australian's "abundance of competition" sub-25 Mbps, heavily capped choices, mmmkay.
0	5	I think insult is a strong word for what I said, but I apologize if you were insulted. Its obvious from looking at your history for 2 seconds that you're not really a turfer, which is why I felt secure in saying what I did in *jest*.   But hey, don't let a sense of humor get in the way of feeling high and mighty, Captain Capitalism.
-	-	It's probably not a Comcast deal, it's a local telco anticompetitive zone.  Basically, if a local telco is offering service over copper wire, you don't get FiOS there.  Also, I'm in PA surrounded by corn fields and cows, and I have FiOS.  Maybe you should move closer to cows.
-	-	I agree with that assertion, that the market pricing alone isn't dangerous, but I have two holistic concerns: 1. The entire internet grows based on an idea of openness and a low transactional cost of activity. Society gets a massive amount of positive externalities from this, including more economic value generated, jobs, availability of information, etc. One could also argue that using the internet is critical to the expression of political or social efficacy. Increasing the transitional costs lowers all of this, and is generally a negative outside of a single industry's profits. I know this saying the benefit of everyone is more important than the benefit of a few, but in this scenario the difference is incredibly huge. One could even say the few would gain on an individual basis via the benefit of everyone. And its not like the few in this case lose versus their current status (which is rather equitable)  2. The usage pricing system doesn't actually reflect the real of cost of the service. Even mathematically, it is hard to express the cost of our internet infrastructure in a per bit manner that isn't approaching zero.  
-	-	The Discovery Channel is a different watching experience than Cartoon Network. Sure, you're watching TV in both cases, but unless you really don't care as long as you're watching *something*, it's not "just data" -- you care about which specific data is being displayed. You can listen to music on the radio, or if you paid more, you can listen to a CD instead. You're listening to music in either case, but going for the tier that included the CD player gives you more options for what music you listen to.  I'd argue that pay-per-view, while similar in some respects, is still a very different payment model. Pay-per-view is a value add; rather than needing to wait until a particular movie comes on TV, you get to start it whenever you want. Bandwidth caps don't add anything to your internet experience, they simply charge you more for continued use.  Using pay-per-view is also an active choice. You know from the start that you don't get the service unless you pay for it up front. Bandwidth caps passively charge you extra for continued use.
1	4	Thank you for the response, and yes my example is an obvious one, although not out of the realm of reasonable speculation. In the U.S, there is rarely more than one ISP provider in a given community. Where I am living now, and elsewhere, there is only one provider. I don't have the choice you have in terms of picking services that compete. Do you know if Australia has legal requirements for fair leasing between the owners of the copper/fiber, and ISPs? I assume you have plenty of ISPs to pick from since each can lease the wiring to your home from the owner. In the U.S, very few companies have agreed to leasing any portion of their local loop. The current outstanding agreements are between the 3 or 4 largest ISPs, and within local loop markets where they do not compete. When I talk about line leasing btw, I mean the local loops between longer haul portions of the infrastructure and local sets of communities. It is also incredibly difficult for a new ISP to rebuild a local loop, because besides capital and investment costs, most municipalities will refuse permitting the construction of a redundant loop. 
-	-	Duh? I'm pretty sure that's what the ISPs are going for.
-	-	Just to be upfront about this -- I work for a service provider.  I am not trying to argue with anyone here, just trying to share some of the concerns that ISP's are facing, and offer up another viewpoint.  Bandwidth usage is growing very quickly.  I think Cisco projected a four fold increase in Internet capacity by 2015.  I do not believe there is any arguement that the largest contributor to this today is online video.  Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, etc.  Video is simply becoming more popular.  There are many consumers that are disconnecting their cable or satellite video subscriptions in favor of Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, or others.  Why not?  Everyone likes to save money.  Me included!  Disconnect that cable bill, consolidate your phone lines via services like Google Voice, disconnect your wireline telephone and just have your cell phone.  All you need is a broadband connection from your local telephone or cable provider... who is losing subscribers, and have less resources to build out and upgrade their broadband networks.  Historically when cable and telephone service providers have invested in their networks, the equipment that they deployed had an estimated life of 10-15 year (or sometimes more).  A new trend began when dialup services started to be deployed.  Today the useful life of networking/broadband equipment is woefully short -- targets now land around 5 years, but is sometimes closer to 3.  This change is being fueled by customer demand and competition.  Customers want more speed, and more features.  While this is good for the pace of technology and innovation, it is bad for recovering investments, and worse for a business trying to stay in business.  Service providers have been worried about this trend for quite some time.  There have been several attempts to mitigate the risk of traffic growth.  In the past those have taken different forms, such as speed caps or bandwidth caps (a volatile topic today).  Speed caps are losing popularity, or becoming more difficult, as competition forces these caps to continually move upward.  Bandwidth caps almost feel like a fallback that give consumers a lot of speed, but restricts the long term impact on the service provider network.  Content providers are also very concerned about these issues.  Their business models are built around using the networks that are being built by service providers.  If service providers institute caps, or are unable to upgrade their networks to support the content being provided, that impacts their ability to deliver service.  The tough question is, with federal support programs in flux for telecommunication providers, customer line loss on anchor services for cable and telephone, and the need to upgrade network/s to support ever-increasing demand, how do service providers keep up?  Some are turning to bandwidth caps.  Others are looking to the content providers to chip in.  I think in the long run there will need to be a vastly different solution.  Demand is not going to decrease, innovation will want to march forward, and consumers need to be able to afford the services they need and want.  No service provider wants to make their customers mad.  It's bad for continued business.  Most (no, not all) are truly interested in providing a quality product in a way that their customers want, and can afford.  They have some harsh truths that they need to face in order to continue business, and sometimes that means compromises.  Anyway, sorry for the ramble.  Bottom line I think we need to find alternate ways to overcome these issues.  Simply being mad at service providers, or being upset at content providers will not solve the issue.  Instead we need to find a creative solution to keep innovation moving forward. 
-	-	This falls into the "the providers are dicks" line of argument.  It's a fair point, and I can understand why many believe this approach is the most sensible when in a situation where the consumer has so little leverage - preserve any advantage you can.  I can accept that may be, on balance, more important than the unequal sharing of the cost burden of infrastructure at the level of the individual customer.  This is especially the case if you believe that (currently) service fees and infrastructure costs are completely de-coupled, due to government intervention.  In the face of that, I could accept that in 2011 your argument is entirely valid. Whether it will remain valid indefinitely is an open question.  I do thank you for taking the time.
-	-	Because, in the US at least, the providers accepted more than $32 billion dollars to upgrade their networks and did jack shit. That money all went to buying competitors and content providers and expanding their business into other areas.  When you are making, quite literally, thousands of percent in profit on a product, and getting the government to hand you more free money because you are preventing competition by signing right-of-way agreements that last more than 20 years, you don't get to be treated as a player in a free and open market.
0	5	I've reversed my downvote, and I feel like a jackass.  I told the truth, I almost never downvote, but I was drinking heavily, and it got away from me.  &gt;If it costs the provider more to deliver the volume of data that you are requesting, should that cost not be passed on to you as a consumer?  Yes, and no.  They have it set up as a buffet.  All you can eat! the advertisements scream, and then they quietly pull you aside, and tell you that since you're getting up for thirds, you'll have to pay extra.  In fact, you grabbed a little more than is allowed with your second plate, so you'll have to pay for that too.  I don't have a problem with the *concept* of metered, but it would have to be treated much more like water or electricity.  I would be willing to pay more, but don't tell me that it costs $50.00/mo to send those 200 gigs up and down.  Give me a realistic figure, and cut youself 40% on the top for overhead/profit.  You won't starve, and I will be paying far less than I am today.  In my mind, this is where capitalism is at odds with the welfare of the people.  I'm not ready to call access to the internet a human right, but it's becoming increasingly important.  You only have to look to areas where municipal utilities have been privatized to see that the little man gets screwed, so I'm not ready to accept that "they provide the service, they should sell it at whatever the market can bear."  Less and less is this a matter of luxury.  But what really set me off was the concept that they (telecoms) should be *justified* in overselling their throughput - I think this is what I was reacting to in particular.  Any way you slice it, it's an underhanded and dirty tactic.  Because of the nature of the business, they know *exactly* how many customers they have, at what tier, and what they can handle.
1	4	nice try, AT&amp;T PR turfer.
1	4	You just got yourself downvoted with the first section of your first sentence. Impressive.
-	-	I also don't mind usage-based billing - as long as it's TOTALLY usage based.  As in, the the bottom of the scale starts at zero.  Right now you get screwed both ways, because you have to pay a subscription just to HAVE it, AND you have to pay for overages.  They shouldn't get it both ways.  That's why I find it hard to believe them when they say that customers using 'extrordinary' amounts and small capacity are the problem.  If it was, they'd be all-to-happy to give incentives for customers to only use what they need by making it so that they only pay for what they use.  In reality, they just want to find more ways to make more money for doing the same or less work, while providing even worse service.
0	6	Don't know why people are downvoting you... While I understand where you (and they) are coming from, ISPs NEED to invest in new and better infrastructure. I would be willing to pay a little extra, as long as I knew the money was being used to improve my internet speeds (i.e. FiOS). Honestly it sounds like ISPs are just being lazy, trying to gain as much profit as they can from outdated equipment.
0	1	So light up the metric shit ton of dark fiber your employer likely has sitting around doing nothing.  Many ISPs haven't innovated in years because they never had to.  They are making money hand over fist and are getting government payouts *specifically for infrastructure upgrades* yet they have the gall to whine and bitch and moan and charge completely exhorbitant fees. Fuck them.  Of course, by upgrading infrastructure, they'd lose their ability to protect their media properties.  This is as much a neutrality issue as anything else.  If an ISP is unable to meet consumer needs, they should lose their psuedo-monopolies.
0	1	I know I'm not in the industry, but from my combined reading of commentary and financial analysis / releases, that's bullshit for the big ISPs.  They're using internet service as a big profit center and the combined expenses are nowhere near as large as they're being portrayed.   The bandwidth caps are pointless because so much of the expense has to deal with equipment designed for peak load, not off-time use.  If I use 300 gb/month on off-hours, why am I penalized while the 10 guys who do 50 gb each during peak hours pay nothing extra?  I'd also be fine paying sane and reasonable costs for extra bandwidth use.  ISP here wants $1/gig on top of their highest network plan ($130/month).  Anything else offers even *less* bandwidth than the 200 gb cap (much less) with even fucking higher per-gig bills.
-	-	There absolutely is when the cap is microscopic. CableOne's cap is 50GB. Once you go over it's 50 cents per gig after that. I can easily do 200GB a month with normal web surfing and Netflix alone as I've replaced tv with it. But I can't use netflix anymore because of the tiny cap. The funny part? CableOne touts their service as being really good for netflix use but in reality doesn't want you using the service you pay for at all.
-	-	I agree with you.  There is nothing inherently wrong with either of these styles.  That being said, the way these companies want to implement these ideas are incredibly flawed.    They want to bill their users like cellphone companies do, a certain amount at a certain speed, and charge big for overages.  I think that most everyone agrees that American cellphone companies are ripping off consumers.  I would be fine with usage billing, but that's not what these companies want.  They want to have their cake and eat it too.  They want to charge their low use users the same and charge their high use users much more.    The problem we are seeing with cap based billing is that many companies that do it (I've heard it most about comcast) are opaque about your actual usage and don't want to provide users with the tools to view and manage their traffic, yet want to charge for overages.    I also have concerns about companies being honest about their billing.  I haven't experienced it with internet yet since my plan is still neither metered, or capped, but I have experienced it several times with my cell phone bill where charges just appear and It's up to me to call in and argue with the phone company to be billed correctly for my usage.  Not many will be able to audit their own data usage and be able to call companies on inflating their numbers.
-	-	The problem with ISPs is the network infrastructure (the fiber lines) are never going to have enough competition to keep the prices down, the cost of operating multiple physical networks is just not practical.
-	-	I'll vote you up. I live in Australia where broadband is capped and it's no problem at all. Also, someone called me an astroturfer on Reddit the other day. I guess it's easier than debating.
-	-	You just got yourself downvoted in two sentences. Not a bad follow-up to the comment poster you were replying to.
1	6	If the profit margins are so low, then what is there to complain about?
1	-	For [Australia's fibre network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network) the plan is to have a tightly-regulated last-mile monopoly, leaving competition among the retail service providers (e.g. ISPs) and backhaul providers.  Hopefully it works out in practice.
-	-	From the article:  &gt; In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Netflix General Counsel David Hyman, wrote that new data tiers by ISPs such as AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon don’t reflect how much it costs to actually increase bandwidth on networks.  In other words, the problem is not that they're charging for bits; it's that they're charging *obscene and unrealistic amounts* for bits.  But hey, don't let facts get in the way of hurling insults at somebody you disagree with.
0	1	Your insult is lame.   There is a comma missing:   "It is wrong**,** fag." - See?
-	-	&gt; The difference is data doesn't have a finite supply in the same sense that those other things you mentioned do.  Of course it does. The fact that congestion exists proves it. You can make only so many hair dryers per unit of time, and you can fit only so many bits through the wires per unit of time.
-	-	Cable television programming is quite arguably just as much of an inexhaustible resource as content delivered via the Internet.    The resources that make data delivery possible (copper, electricity, silicon) themselves dictate the supply.  I can argue that electricity is in infinite supply, inasmuch as I could never - as an individual - use more than the power company could provide.  If I ran every electric device in my house full tilt 24/7, the power company's still doing fine.  The limits to their capacity to deliver electrons are no more relevant to this debate than the theoretical maximum that can be sustained by a cable company's data network.  Ultimately, I'm not paying my provider for the data itself, I'm paying for the delivery of that data, and every provider has a fixed maximum deliverable capacity which my monthly fees support.  edit: The notion that I can have more delivered and not pay more is pretty presumptuous.  The UPS truck passes my house every day, but that doesn't mean I should get to ship as much crap as I like for a flat fee.  UPS is free to offer that kind of service, but I'm not going to demand that they do so.
-	-	I don't buy your car analogy.  Unless you're talking about adding a physical DVR, the cable company programming tiers have nothing to do with added capability.  They only determine which frames of video and PCM streams get successfully decrypted by your box.  The box itself gets nothing akin to "a better engine."  The Discovery Channel does not "change what I can do" with my television.  It's just data that it can display.  &gt; A more correct analogy between bandwidth caps and cable TV would be if cable companies began charging based on how much time you spent watching TV...I think it's very reasonable to assume that people would be up in arms if some cable provider started trying to charge that way.   They do charge this way.  It's called pay-per-view or on demand.  No one complains.  Granted it's *on top of* a separate tiered system, but I have yet to hear anyone raise a philosophical argument that I should pay once for unlimited video rentals from Comcast.
-	-	As much as I agree with you that it *can* be an anti-competitive practise, often times it's not.  The biggest problem in the first sentence is "operating". An "operating" ISP has very little in the way of direct costs as to the data it supplies, up until the point where the they're unable to provide enough data to customers, at which point they need to roll out infrastructure across their entire operating region. And *that* is not cheap. They need to recoup the costs in some fashion, and it's really not paid for by unlimited plans.  As for "net neutrality", you'll find that in any country with bandwidth caps it isn't an issue. ISPs in Australia struggle to remain competitive. They need to provide data as cheaply as they can, while paying per byte themselves - the data is wholesaled by certain providers which own the international links. I get about 150gb, at 20mbps, for $60/month, and I can do anything I want with my data.  The biggest problem with your "anticompetitive" example is that it's *blatantly* anticompetitive. There's no way any ISP would be able to defend that business model in court, at least not in Australia.   The second problem is that there are very few services that use enough data that their business model is modified by the amount of data transferred. The only one I can think of other than streaming video is the downloading of games.   With my cap of 150gb/month I don't even blink when visiting search, ecommerce, or social sites. Not in any way. YouTube isn't even a blip on my radar. I can spend hours and hours streaming SC2 games on Justin.tv and not worry.  So, game download services: The only one to even think of is Steam, to be honest. I can't even think of another game distribution platform I'd use, and my ISP, being the nice people they are, added the Steam servers to unmetered usage. We don't pay for data when we buy a game off Steam. Does my ISP charge for this? No, because they're not interested in charging more than they have to, since the entire Australian market is built around cost minimisation. If there were another service, my ISP would probably unmeter that as well, presuming it made sense to provide it to the customer base.  Finally we get to the crux of the issue, services like Netflix. Guess what kind of services simply don't have a presence in the Australian market? ISPs are trying to push them, but no one is biting. It's just not a big market here. Netflix aren't operating in Australia. Who else is there? There's a startup named FetchTV here that require you to buy their FetchBox. As far as I know it's not going anywhere, and no one I know uses their service, but already my ISP offers unmetered downloads on their movie catalogue.    I just don't see the doomsday you do, I suppose.
0	1	Fuck Comcast. Its actually ILLEGAL for fucling Verizon to bring me FIOS because Comcast is in bed with the local government. Fios cut of point is half a fucking block from my house. Literally. This is Philadelphia too, not the middle of nowhere PA.  I refuse to give Comcast another cent, so I've been workout internet at home for three months now..  :(
1	6	Any idea how we can actually stop this from happening, since we already are the consumers of their products and boycotting isn't really an option?
1	6	Netflix is right to do this, but I can't understand why more content companies aren't on board with this thinking. It hurts all of them. Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Facebook now with video chat. Google. They are all going to lose customers to this. 
-	-	For all these downvotes, I wish *someone* would bother to address the basic question honestly:  If it costs the provider more to deliver the volume of data that you are requesting, should that cost not be passed on to you as a consumer?  My first post questioned the objections I see all the time on reddit (and elsewhere) against the idea of metered / tiered service based on data volumes (regardless of how it is implemented / priced), and I still have seen nothing that is even remotely convincing that being screwed on a plan with data limits would be worse than being screwed on a flat rate plan - except for those who are moving data at the top 0.1% of the spread. How is there not a fair argument to be made that these users are leeching on upstream infrastructure that others pay for at parity, but make far less use of, by factors of 1/1000 or 1/10000?  Can someone please explain how that's fair?  edit: in case I was not clear in previous posts, I have **nearly zero** faith that these plans will be *implemented* in ways that are not hostile to consumers, but that is a separate fight in my mind.  Volume-based service may also make regulating providers that much more difficult, but these are both issues that are best dealt with by facilitating market entry for competitors.  Far worse than metering / tiering have been the legislative moves against municipal and other local providers of wireless and wireline services.
-	-	This was mainly a hypothetical. And I completely see your point. I was referring to the poster above who believed it may become pay for what you use, not just caps. If pay for what you use becomes norm, then a system will have to be put in place to stop ads. This would be like the water company charging you, because someone else is turning on your sprinkler at night. Or allowing excess water to into my house in order to show more used. I am not consuming nor do I want the extra water. totally see where you are coming from, I still believe caps and pay for what you use is shit, especially due to apps requiring more bandwidth and providers touting speed and throughput, only to help reach that ceiling quicker.  
-	-	Oh, *snap*.
1	6	"Is Vexal Chinese?"   "*What!?!*" [Jules shoots Brett in the arm]   "Does he type . . . Chinese?"
-	-	&gt; Discovery Channel is a different watching experience than Cartoon Network  Their web sites also deliver different experiences.  If a "different experience" is worth more across one medium, shouldn't the same rules apply to them all?  No.  Because it's just data - your perception may make it seem different, but it's just data and the royalties attached to it.  &gt; Bandwidth caps don't add anything to your internet experience.  They give you choices in terms of pricing plans - which is compelling to people who use the Internet in a different way than you do, apparently.  They can choose to live within a given cap and save money.  As far as passive charges, this has been the case with mobile calling minutes for decades.  There have certainly been abuses, but nothing that calls me to question the idea that people should have the option to select a calling plan that has a finite number of minutes.
-	-	&gt; Each channel costs the providers millions of dollars.  Again, the limits only become apparent at the top level of the system.  As far as the user is concerned, he or she can't possibly consume all the content that the service makes available.  Which leads me to my second point:   &gt; ISPs don't really have the capacity to give me a 25Mbit line, then they shouldnt sell it to me in the first place.  You should cancel your current service, because there is no provider that can accommodate maximal throughput for every subscriber simultaneously.  Interconnects off last-mile service are a fraction of the combined bandwidth of all subscribers on the serviced network segment, because no one would waste money on backbone to service that vanishingly unlikely event.  Networks are engineered to deliver a reasonable prediction of peak traffic, which has more to do with the subscriber mix and usage patterns over the day and week.  Further upstream, the last-mile speeds become pretty trivial factors, as the sustained traffic of tens of thousands of users have to be moved along together.  A small number of users streaming low-res video over bargain-priced connections generate more data than a large number of gamers on high-speed links.  The aggregate data determines what sort of upstream pipes are required to service all of the ISPs customers and, just like cable TV providers, they pay millions of dollars to light up new fiber when that becomes necessary.  So if your high volume of data traffic, and the volumes of thousands of others just like you, are independently driving up the *upstream* data costs for the ISP, why should you not pay more?
-	-	But international calls - and the internet is international - are billed by time.  Or were the last time I used them. I haven't for years. Yay Skype.
-	-	The copper is *all* owned by the former state telecommunications company, Telstra. It was privatised a decade or so ago, and while they retain ownership of the infrastructure they are legally obliged to provide the services at reasonable cost to competitors. There's also currently legislation being put through parliament (the National Broadband Network legislation) which would split the infrastructure element of Telstra from the retail sector, putting the control of the infrastructure back in the government owned NBN Co., who would be using it as a backbone to provide FTTN and FTTP services.  I don't know if you know much about DSL services, but the local telephone exchanges require DSLAMs installed in order to provide ADSL2+ service. Telstra is again obliged to provide space in the exchange for those DSLAMs, but there is only space for so many competing companies. (Meaning they can provide service faster and cheaper than Telstra is willing to do, from the exchange to the premises.) Telstra are still obliged to provide ADSL ports to other ISPs at wholesale rates so that they can provide them to the customers, but these ports inevitably end up slightly more expensive and slower than the ISPs own hardware.  Backhaul from exchanges is *all* handled by Telstra. New connections are *all* handled by Telstra. Exchange issues, line faults, etc, *all* handled by Telstra. This, in combination with Telstra's notoriously poor tech support means that life is made a little difficult when you have faults with another ISP, since you lodge with your ISP and then they lodge with Telstra. Hopefully that issue gets fixed, but besides that issue the ISP ecosystem seems relatively healthy.  From my house, I have an option of at least 6 different ISPs off the top of my head. I could probably ring around and find at *least* 10 more willing to offer me resold Telstra wholesale services, like I mentioned they are legally obliged to provide.  I would say that if the NBN legislation gets passed, there will be a reduction in costs for all Australian ISPs *except* Telstra, who abuse their position of dominance sometimes. Data rates for customers on resold Telstra are not extortionate, simply slightly more expensive than I believe they should be.  The major ISPs involved in competitive pricing are actually ISPs that were (or are) smaller ISPs. One of the major ISPs pushing prices lower is Internode - my ISP - and the director of Internode is quite transparent about his business practises. He's mentioned before that the cost of data is actually the cost sustainable by taking advantage of the number of customers who regularly use less data, and passing on the savings on those customers to the heavier users. (If I didn't explain that very well: If all customers used 100% of their cap, the costs would be unsustainable and result in Internode drastically raising prices or going out of business.)  Internode, through such practises, almost single-handedly pushed the entire Australian broadband market to more competitive pricing, while simultaneously growing their market share to become a major player in the Australian broadband world. In the past 5 years we've gone from having 15gb cap @ $50/mo to 150gb cap @ $60/mo. They're also consistently rated as the #1 ISP in Australia by the largest online broadband discussion community, [whirlpool.net.au](http://www.whirlpool.net.au/)  The fact that several other medium sized ISPs helped with this push obviously didn't hurt much at all.  Sorry if all of this seems like too much of an essay for you. I don't really know how interested you are in these things, but it seems to me like in a world where broadband caps seem like they're going to become the norm, the Australian model is a very robust and competent model. :)
0	2	I almost never downvote, except for spam.  Congratulations, this is a new level of ridiculousness I have never encountered.  It does help me understand, in part, why legislation is so far behind the excuses and lies.  Thanks for that, at least.
-	-	It's not up to anyone but you to make sure you're using what you're paying for in an efficient manner.   The water company charges you per litre, or gallon, but they don't come to your house and fix your leaky taps, nor do they give you a discount when you need to maintain things, like perhaps refilling a pool.  I can quite easily solve your ad usage though. Don't use ad-supported services. Problem solved. If you want to use those services, deal with the costs associated.  I'm going to assume you've never lived in a country with restrictive bandwidth caps, since it appears that you basically have no idea what you're on about with regards to minimising cap usage.  By far - and I mean by **far** - the data you consume is used by whatever it is you're actually doing. Torrenting, downloading games, watching movies. I could *maybe* stretch out an extra 0.5% of cap by going above and beyond simply installing adblock plus. It's simply not worth the time and effort. 
-	-	Welcome to Canada, circa 2005
-	-	Maybe CDN bandwidth costs around $0.01/GB, but egress bandwidth is much more expensive, like $0.08/GB at volume.  CDN bandwidth is for static content like movies.  Egress is used for many other scenarios like email, online gaming, Bittorrent, and essentially anything that is dynamic and not manually managed by big static content providers.
-	-	I still don't get the backlash against the *mere concept* of tiered or metered Internet service.  To me, Netflix's position in this argument is like Craftsman or Conair telling utility companies that charging by the kilowatt-hour will end up costing the users of table saws or hair dryers too much.  For practically any consumable resource delivered to the home (water, electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, etc.) the price is ~~linked~~ directly linked to the volume delivered.  For most other services (cable television, local phone service, newspaper, etc.) there are tiered delivery options.  No one is bitching that cable companies don't offer unlimited channels to every subscriber.  As things stand, low-utilizers of Internet service are subsidizing their torrenting and streaming peers.  If you're only going to move 50 MB a month with casual surfing and email, why should you pay as much as someone who pulls 100 or 1000 times that amount?  The incremental costs to the ISP for each individual GB are small, but taken in aggregate, they are substantial.  If you're going to argue that all data should be uncapped, then you should also argue that everyone should have the same data rate and latency - and volunteer to pay more each month, if that's what it will take to get grandpa up to 25 Mbit.  Value for money is a legit argument, so if you want to argue that cable and ILECs gouge customers with exorbitant data rates, you're welcome to it.  These companies certainly abuse their market exclusivity, but they do so no matter what plans they offer.  It's a totally different question.  Comcast could offer reasonable data rates in flat or tiered plans - it just chooses not to because it has a captive audience.
-	-	Netflix has a clear plan to cope with reduced available bandwidth...   they have recently made their user interface much worse and much more difficult to use in order to discourage their customers from watching so much content. 
0	1	FUCK EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS
0	2	DUH, you think ISPs will change their services so customers pay LESS? hahahha where do you think you are japan? south korea?
-	-	[Regulatory Capture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture).  The FCC has a strong recent history of facilitating the interests of big industry rather than the public they were designed to serve the interests of.
-	-	Money. Truckloads of it. 
0	6	I don't understand how they can even attempt this without it being an obvious attempt to block competition.  The solution is simple.  TV stations need these companies to broadcast their stations.  Give each broadcaster a % of ad revenue generated based on the amount of viewers they have.  Fox, NBC, ABC, CTV, Global.. need Comcast, Rogers, Bell, etc.. as much as they need them. 
0	2	And while the monopolies, the conglomerates and the studios attack them with internet throttling, caps and bad press they make enormously massive deals with them with the other hand as if nothing remarkable is going on at all.  Capitalism is a dirty thing.
1	6	Which is a good argument why network access providers shouldn't be allowed to also be content providers. 
1	6	Where's the no part? How is getting more money from consumers not the point?
-	-	If one examines the cost structure of any operating ISP, the cost of actual costs are incredibly low, especially for land based systems. If anyone is interested in this, there was a very informative interview by Leo Laporte with Tim Pozat on the Triangulation podcast (check itunes) about the ISP industry's setup, as well as their cost structure.   I wouldn't really mind any company changing their price system, but there is a huge lack of choices for most, if not all Americans. This is especially so at different levels of service and price. The play I could see happening, is that an ISP introduces cap, tiered, or usage based pricing. They then introduce competitors for search, content delivery, and other internet services and as a promotion doesn't count their own services toward a cap or a usage bill. That would be completely anti competitor and unfair, and at the prices the ISPs would like to implement, make any other service impossible to use.  For example, Comcast introduces Netflix competitor Xfinity. Netflix uses a gig per hour, and the usage price is maybe $0.5 per gigabyte (the amount of $0.5 isn't important, although it is a low ball). Let us also say that both services are $8 a month, and a user does about 16 hours a month (again, a lowball number IMHO). Netflix could have its price doubled to the consumer's point of view, despite no making any change themselves. Xfinity is clearly advantaged, despite not having yet provided any additional service differences. Repeat this for any internet service, (search, e-commerce, news, social media), and the internet is no longer an even playing field. The amount of choice decreases, and consumers lose the benefits of competition.   So, IMHO, I do think capping can easily evolve into an anticompetitive practice. 
-	-	&gt;More like buying petrol, water or electicity instead of...  Not comparable. Those are fungible commodities. Bandwidth is a service. There are limitations on how *quickly* they can move bits over your pipe, but the cost of those actual bits is effectively **zero**.
-	-	More like a series of tube-loads of money.  
0	6	This is true, but that money has always been there.  I don't understand how they managed to do it back then (Bell) vs now.  
-	-	The difference is data doesn't have a finite supply in the same sense that those other things you mentioned do.  No one has a problem with a tiered pricing model when it comes to things that actually are in finite supply.  For example, people have been paying for different levels of bandwidth in the US for as long as there have been ISPs here.
-	-	The cable analogy doesn't hold at all.  Each package of cable channels is effectively adding features to the basic cable package. A good analogy here is buying a car. I could buy a bare bones Honda Civic, but I could pay more and add power locks and windows. I could pay even more to add a better sound system or perhaps a better engine. None of these upgrades limit my ability to actually use the car as much as I want, they simply change what I can do with it and how well it does it. This is perfectly sensible (ignoring the fact that with cable channels, you tend to need to pay for a bunch of channels you don't care about to get the package that includes the one you do want).  Right now, the best internet equivalent is paying extra for a faster connection. Luckily, we don't have to deal with something like buying the "Search Package" to be able to use Google, or the "Social Media Package" for Facebook and Reddit.   A more correct analogy between bandwidth caps and cable TV would be if cable companies began charging based on how much time you spent watching TV. Perhaps the basic package gives you 20 hours per month, and charges you extra for every minute you watch over that. Or you could pay extra to get a base 40 hours per month, or maybe even unlimited usage.  I think it's very reasonable to assume that people would be up in arms if some cable provider started trying to charge that way.
-	-	[deleted]
-	-	No
0	6	&gt; charge users by the amount of data they use will end up costing consumers more   Isn't that the point?
0	2	Paying by the bit? Well, I'll pay for the 1s, but I ain't paying for the 0s.
0	2	What sucks is that MOST people use below their bandwidth limit but these ISPs are unwilling to let a few people go above it. Something like less than 10%?  It's the nature of corporations. SIGH
-	-	[This](http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/02/08/22/1431255/Answers-From-Community-ISP-Leader) may help.
-	-	That one was to be run by a city, not a co-op.
0	2	It's not necessarily that the ISPs want the customers to pay more, but that the ISPs want customers to pay *them* more. Only when they push Netflix out of the market will they consider ratcheting up the prices ;)
0	2	I interpreted the "no" part as in "no, it's actually something worse than simply higher bandwidth costs."
0	5	You see... That is where i failed ;)
0	2	Because they also instinctively become anti-competitive and in doing so they cease to adequately serve both network access and content.   This can be a problem especially when _all_ of the network providers do this; they each become a monopoly.   The problem then becomes breaking up these antitrust cartels.   What do?
-	-	It is incredibly close to zero. And as for how ISPs talk about the problems of network congestion, most of it is incorrectly described. Bandwidth is the width of the pipe, measured in bytes/time. To introduced a tiered system or by usage in terms of bytes is incorrectly representing the actual system. It doesn't cost really visibly anything to send more packets through a working wire, which every connection is.
-	-	I'm not saying they're not making ridiculous profits. That's a different issue. You can charge by the gigabyte with a reasonable price just as you can charge for unlimited access at a thousand dollars a month.  The actual change in market model from unlimited to metered? Not a problem in of itself. It's the way most markets work. You pay for what you use.
-	-	Some things are good and some things are bad.  Compared to the US, the main thing we have an abundance of is meaningful competition. Most people use ADSL, and Telstra is required to lease certain parts of its copper infrastructure to competing ISPs, so the end result is that customers have dozens of different service providers to choose from.  Another plus is that we have systems in place that make it relatively easy to transfer (“churn”) from one ADSL provider to another. I'm not sure if this is a regulatory thing or an industry thing, either way ISPs end up having much more incentive to be nice to their customers.
-	-	Not necessarily -- they could sell bundled packages, such as "unlimited access to Netflix, plus up to 5GB of whatever traffic you want per month."

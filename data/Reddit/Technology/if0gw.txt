0	1	They are on ISP's LAN. They can configure their DHCP to give any address they want. They are implementing NAT, who gives a shit what range they use.
-	-	So?
1	4	While the ISP can definitely do this, they shouldn't.  The IP address 10.215.2.32 should be available to be assigned within someone's private/local network.  Of course, most users aren't going to use 10.* as their subnet since they don't need 3 full octets of addresses, but it's definitely considered "bad practice", if nothing else.

0	5	The ISP's LAN as you put it is the same thing, so is 144.169 (corperate) and 192.168.  What's the problem?
0	5	I have secured the ISP lines into this apartment complex, and am running DHCP off a shittey flashed Linksys router assigning private addresses to those that want them!

1	4	Wait, I'm in Pakistan and i have heard nothing about this

0	5	hey guyz i keep trying to ddos it but keep getting request timed out wtf?
0	2	That address is in the 10.0.0.0 block (one of the private IP ranges). Do they have all of their customers behind a NAT? Also, are they running every one of their customers through a single server? Because that's just dumb. 
-	-	Saad Hamid, is that you?
-	-	IP addresses like 10.x.x.x are private.
0	5	I can't figure out if this post is either an indication of total technological stupidity, or a joke.

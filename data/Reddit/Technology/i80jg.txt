If they really want to know what effect the Verizon iPhone had why don't they compare the US growth figures to the international figures? The iPhone has been available on multiple networks for a long time in other countries. If that slow down is also occurring there, then the iPhone has nothing to do with it.

The market is still evolving quickly, so a bit of give and take between the market share for Apple and Google is to be expected, but Apple has a huge amount of market share to claw back before they have the top platform.

There really hasn't been a "big" release of a device except for the Thunderbolt, which outsold the VZW iphone 4.  The release of the Sensation and Evo 3D should help upturn this, along with the eventual Bionic and Galaxy S2 releases.

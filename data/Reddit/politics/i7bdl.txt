1	6	Tour???  Tour???  PAC paid for tour???  Funny, I thought she said it was a vacation???  Tour??
0	3	I never thought about it, but it does seem weird that politicians can be selected for jury duty just like everyone else.  I'd be scared shitless to have her kind of crazy on my jury...
-	-	Yeah yeah, that's what Jesus said too.
0	1	oh right.  the tour itself hasn't been "canceled," just the parts that involved travel, and stops in different cities, all of which had planned for her to deliver a canned speech, and had been notified of her impending arrival.  those all went belly-up; but they weren't canceled, they were just ... "descheduled."   she didn't quit, damnit!  
1	6	When I went on vacation I went on a tour of the Grand Canyon... see how language works?

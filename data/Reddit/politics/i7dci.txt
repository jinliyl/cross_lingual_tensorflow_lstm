This became more popular after OPEC failed to agree on increasing output a couple of weeks ago when Iran headed the most recent OPEC meeting. Saudi Arabia is still planning on increasing output, much to Iran's chagrin, but the perceived stagnation in supply led to a massive uptick in speculation. Libyan oil disruption was obviously taken into account also.  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43510170/ns/business-going_green  http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/677-e2-wire/168089-dems-oil-release-a-blow-to-speculators  http://www.investorideas.com/news/2011/energy/06231.asp

Its real damn simple, if you don't have the capabilities to accept future delivery of the contracts then you can't buy them. Fuckers sitting in an office in Wall Street don't have anywhere to put millions of barrels of oil, and once you force them to have that in order to play the game it is no longer worth the risk. Right now they just buy up futures contracts and resell them to each other, limiting the supply of oil futures contracts to actual suppliers and driving up the price. Just undo Bush's Commodity Futures Modernization Act and the price will come down fairly significantly, like $10-20 per barrel.  EDIT: I hadn't considered that this move will fuck over some of the speculators on contracts they are holding, so that part is nice.

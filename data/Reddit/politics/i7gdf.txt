-	-	This is kind of like the only movie Patrick Swayze was ashamed of; "Red Dawn" which featured a fictitious invasion of the US by the Cubans and the Soviets. Never mind that the Soviets were in the process of collapsing from their own weight in 1984 and the Cubans couldn't even feed them selves at the time.  The movie was a great box office success at the time. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dawn

-	-	Speaking of Red Dawn, apparently there's a [remake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dawn_(2011_film\)) coming out which was originally going to have the Chinese replace the Soviets (but was later changed in post-production to be North Korea to be viable in the lucrative Chinese market).

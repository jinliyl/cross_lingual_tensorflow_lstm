0	2	Say you start a forest fire, when the fire looks like it's about to be contained, and the authorities start investing man power to track down who started the fire, what do you do? Start another forest fire! That will keep the attention away from you so you can go off and perform some more mischief.  This is the Republican strategy for staying in office.  Eventually you will run out of forests to burn.
1	6	&gt; "The reality here is until our Republican colleagues are more concerned about our need to reduce the deficit than they are worried about what Grover Norquist will say, were going to have a really difficult time reducing the deficit," he [Van Hollen] said.  Exactly. It's called compromise. You're not going to get everything that you want when doing it, and you might have to do things which are distasteful to you, but it ends up resulting in something in which both parties can agree to.  The GOP hasn't done much of anything to show that they have been willing to compromise at all, and instead have been using this as a coded excuse to try to insist that they get everything their way. As such, they threw a tantrum when they essentially found out that they would need to compromise.  So, this leads me to think that either they never were serious about this to begin with, and just wanted to stall, or they just don't really care. If they want to rejoin now, they should have to lose a little bit of face, and expect to have to compromise a bit harder in order to make up for the little stunt that they did. Which isn't likely to happen, I'd think.

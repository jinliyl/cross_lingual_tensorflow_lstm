0	5	Victim here. I was pulled over in Fort Paine, Alabama on my way back from Mardi Gras. They found less than a quarter ounce in my car. I was 18 at the time and in my freshman year of college. The State Troopers tore up my car seats and broke my console. They cut my necklace off with a knife, I was strip searched, cavity searched, sprayed with a hose, and thrown in the "bull pen" overnight. There were no beds left so I had to sleep on a mat on the floor. I was sick for several days from sleeping on the cold floor, had to borrow $300 from a friend to post bail, then walked 10 miles to the impound lot to retrieve my car. If I were a lesser man it would have scarred me for life. I'm now 31 and occasionally smoke to relax and relieve anxiety.  GG, War on Drugs.

1	8	And that's just the tip of the iceberg, but its probably the reason the ATF is selling guns to Mexican drug cartels... to help pay the bill to incarcerate people in possession of a plant.

1	8	Pretty absurd for simple possession, right? That's what I thought too at the time.

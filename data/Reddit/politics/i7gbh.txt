0	2	Well, at least their previous arguments could have possibly had a basis in fact. Like "gay marriange will make it easier for them to adopt kids and it is harmful to children to have 2 same sex parents" There is no evidence for that but it was possible to determine whether that statement was true because it was not obviously illogical a priori. Like we didn't know whether that was true or not until people did studies.  Or the statement, "God meant for only men and women to get married, and our laws should reflect the will of God." Now I disagree with that but you can at least get behind the idea that ethics should be considered in law even if we disagree about what ethical system to use.   In this article, there is no appeal to any kind of hypothesis to test with any kind of evidence. There is no philosophical debate to be had about what the law should or should not do. He is just saying something that is blatantly false and hoping that because he used certain hot-button words people will agree with him. This tactic has been used before but not so extreme as to the point that if you speak English, you will know instantly that he is contradicting himself. That's a first for me.

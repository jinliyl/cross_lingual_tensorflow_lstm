1	8	Large cuts in the defense budget are probably impossible because of bi-partisan opposition to those cuts. Libya is a very tiny 1 billion dollars in mostly maintenance and supply costs. 
1	6	Think about it... when Cantor says "Republicans have made clear that we will not agree to raise the debt limit without real spending cuts...." what he is doing is forcing Democrats to propose cuts.  Now if the Democrats REALLY had any progressive or leftward principles left, the answer would be simple:  "Sure, we'll cut defense spending and tax cuts for the rich."  Of course, Obama has just led the way to war in Libya and re-upping the rich tax cuts, so that's not gonna happen.  But suppose it did... where is all the campaign money the Democrats need going to come from?  Or Democrats could cut social programs... and alienate their base.  (What's left of their base.)  TL;DR:  Cantor says you're fucked and he can't hold in the giggles.

1	6	Wait.  Did I just watch a fucking interview on FOX that had salient points in it? 
0	2	I hate when politicians call it an entitlement program. We pay into social security, and we pay taxes to pay for these programs. They are services that we the tax payer fund, and most of them can't understand that.
1	6	If Social Security were funded through direct payments that funded a combination disability insurance and retirement annuity, that would be one thing. But, my understanding is that that's not the way it works. Are you saying that the Social Security payments that come out of our paychecks (along with the employer contribution) covers the program entirely?
1	8	I would like to point out that Dictators also do the following:  1. eat 2. sleep 3. pee 4. drive 5. talk  Just because a dictator does something does not make that thing inherently evil. 
0	5	Yes it is supposed to but like spamdefender pointed out politicians take money from it.
1	4	Yes it does and it also has produced a massive surplus which politicians occasionally dip into to fund other projects.  In it's current state, there is enough money to fund social security through 2025.

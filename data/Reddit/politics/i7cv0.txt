1	6	Why? In Rep speak they would called "revenue enhancements" and everybody would vote for them..
-	-	Language correction:  Democrats are asking for tax loopholes, and subsidies for oil companies and tax breaks for big business, to be eliminated. "Closing tax loopholes" is not the same thing as "raising taxes." It's making big business pay what it's supposed to pay.  To say that's "raising taxes" would be like if I tried to steal a rake from Walmart and got caught, and then when Walmart made me pay for it, I got all pissy because they "raised the price."
0	5	&gt; Democrats wanted to raise taxes and eliminate loop holes. thats a double hit.  They may want to raise taxes on the super-rich (this is something Obama has suggested a number of times), but in this particular negotiation, as I understand it, all Democrats are asking for is an elimination of subsidies, tax breaks, and loopholes for big businesses.  And anyway, that's not a "double hit." It is, at most, a "single hit" (but since taxes on the rich are far lower than they should be in an ostensibly progressive taxation system, that's debatable). Again, closing tax loopholes is not the same as raising taxes -- it's just eliminating methods of cheating the system.  &gt; Also many republicans were for eliminating ethonal subsides and the like why didn't that pass?  Many Democrats are for eliminating ethanol subsidies as well. And it did pass. The [final Senate vote](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/16/us-usa-senate-ethanol-idUSTRE75F5IN20110616) on the measure was 73-27 in favor. The White House has said they're against ending ethanol subsidies, but it's not quite accurate to suggest Republicans were all for it and Democrats were all against.
1	6	Correction republicans wanted to eliminate many loop holes but leave rates the same. Democrats wanted to raise taxes and eliminate loop holes. thats a double hit. Also many republicans were for eliminating ethonal subsides and the like why didn't that pass?
-	-	The White House is hinting that Obama will veto any effort to remove the subsidies, which is probably what you heard about the proposal failing. If Obama does that, it's pretty likely that it will fail.
-	-	On your second point i did not mean to make it sound like they were all for or against. Though i thought the elimination of the ethonal subsidies failed. Atleast thats what i read last week.

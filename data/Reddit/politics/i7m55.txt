1	6	Wow, what juevos, taking on the man in a frontal attack! [Relevant repost](http://i.imgur.com/HVVCf.jpg)
1	6	I was under the impression that LulzSec was the anti-Anonymous.  This sounds like hacking for "good" as opposed to doing it just for the lulz.  Am I wrong?
1	6	Why aren't they attacking the federal government - since they put the illegal in illegal immigration.
0	3	I'm not really against chinga la migra, but if these guys just put out raw data like this they're going to get somebody killed. You know the bad guys have computers too, yeah? If there are informants names and identity there will be blood on the streets. As long they understand this, but I doubt if they do. 
0	3	According to this [totally legitimate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pY1DC9PmYU) and awesome Taiwanese animated news report, LulzSec and Anonymous have joined forces for Operation AntiSec which is aimed at governments.
-	-	Yeah, I think you're wrong. I don't believe they're at war.  &gt; Attention #Media: about #Lulzsec and #Anonymous, we are not at war. We are bros of teh internetz. Also, /b/ != Anonymous.  [source tweet](http://twitter.com/#!/anonops/status/81794348626345984)
0	3	Not really.  While there is a chance someone may die, it is a direct result of that person deciding to continue in their line of work supporting this.  The people who 'had no choice' as they were too poor and had no other job options are not the people to be put in risk.  The guy going undercover in some gang, he could have taken a different job.  Of course, as always, when someone is killed, the blame lies with the killer.

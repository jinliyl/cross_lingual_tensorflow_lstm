1	6	Yes what if tootheless unemployed beer swilling rednecks stopped producing?  What if old Medicare recipients stopped being captains of industry?  If Conservatives "Go Galt" nothing will happen.  You fucktards don't contribute anything anyway.
0	5	&gt; The plot of Rand’s novel is simple, despite its length — 1,088 pages in the current paperback edition. The United States is governed by bureaucrats, “looters” and “moochers,” who penalize and demonize creative people.     &gt; The country is in decline because creative people are disappearing — they have followed the innovative John Galt to a mountain enclave, “Galt’s Gulch,” where they watch society crumble. Creativity has gone on strike (the working title of the novel was “The Strike”), and the engine of capitalism cannot run without it.  Oh for the simple times where the US wasn't mixed in the web of global trade and politics.

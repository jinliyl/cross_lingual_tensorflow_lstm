1	6	Wow...Ron Paul has pulled in 6K from the marijuana lobby since 2002.  Quite the haul.
0	2	Ever think that this is because these two men already say "crazy" things in congress and fight for the tough issues?  If they gave their lobbying money (all $6000 of it) to some other dude, he would probably just take it and never even offer real support. They would make an off-hand comment to a local hack and then let it all die down while avoiding calls from the lobbyists.  This is a positive story framed as a negative one.
0	1	no shit?  i interviewed a chamber of commerce lobbyist the other day and he said his organization regularly sends checks to legislators who vote "pro-business."  is it not understood that lobbyists reward legislators who promote their agendas?  that's sort of their primary function.
1	4	Scumbag reddit:  Is against ~~bribes~~ lobby money.  Its okay tho this time because its for an issue i support. 
-	-	TIL there's a marijuana lobby O.o 
0	1	You're kidding right??  $18K and $6 contributions are a drop in the drop in a bucket compared to what insurance companies, Big Pharma, Oil and Gas companies....and now any corporations who wants to..use to bribe congress!  
0	3	It's ok when Ron Paul does it because he is doing it in everyone's best interest.  Come on sheeple, wake up!  When other politicians take money, it is for evil purposes.  Sheeple, wake up sheeple.

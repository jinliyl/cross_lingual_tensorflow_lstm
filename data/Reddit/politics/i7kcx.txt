1	8	Actually met an Afghani once, said the people in Kabul are pretty terrified of what will happen if we leave Afghanistan. Various extremist groups still hold most of the south, so much so that if you're at all affiliated with the government the area is unsafe for you to even travel through, and a network of Sunni madrassas in Pakistan are doing pretty heavy recruitment. Folks send their kids off, knowingly or not, and the kids come back with pretty militant views. Fuck Michael Moore. I'm not crazy about war but it sounds like our presence is the only thing that country from collapsing into another bloody power struggle.

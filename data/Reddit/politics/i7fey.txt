1	8	There was no meltdown in Nebraska.  You forget that millions of people live right by those two plants. Trust me, there is no coverup that is even possible at that size or the USSR would have done it with things like Chernobyl. Not to mention the people I know that live nearby and the NYTimes covering it and the local news there covering it.   ** You're just looking for disaster porn at this point**   
1	6	Yes I have heard about Nebraska's power plant issues. What now?
1	8	There has not been a meltdown at the Nebraska plant (at least that any respected organization has reported.)   &gt;the Obama regime has ordered a “total and complete” news blackout relating to any information regarding the near catastrophic meltdown of the Fort Calhoun Nuclear Power Plant located in Nebraska.   Even your sensationalized article states it was a near meltdown - not a meltdown as stated in your headline. The cooling of the Nebraska plant went offline for an insignificant amount of time (90 minutes) and caused the cooling pool to rise by something like 3 degrees (F) from... ~87 to 90 (F).   The point? Meltdowns of this nature, in this type of reactor, require that the coolant boils off and subsequently exposes the fuel rods. That happens at ~212 (F). The problem was fixed in an hour - they could have probably had the cooling systems off for hours (the reactor is apparently designed to run for 88 hours with the cooling system offline) and have been okay. Assuming a consistent increase of 2 degrees (F) per hour, (which of course is bad science/math, but should give an idea of how much of a non-event the fire was) the plant would've taken 61 hours to overheat.   tldr; OP's article has no mention of a meltdown actually occurring. Additionally, if the official story is true the reactor was no where near melting down.   edit: fixed some typos...

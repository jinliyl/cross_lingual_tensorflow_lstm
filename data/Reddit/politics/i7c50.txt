0	5	If this is so, and this pill is unprofitable to make, transport, and store... perhaps they should not make it.  Because if sick people need this to get well, the demand is surely there.  If it's just a sugar pill they could raise their prices to a $4,000/pop and nobody would care.
0	1	What a bunch of horse shit. This medication is being made profitably by generics manufacturers right now, they supply my country with it for ~$5 per 1000 pills. The chemical is public property, any company can make it and sell it, for however much they want to, and we will pay the fair market price. If it costs money to ship and store, then that is included in the price.  What is it about Americans and the 'free market'? They wank on about it to no end, but *never actually use it, in any way, shape or form*.  It's corruption and nothing more, your country is full of it.
0	1	Is that what we are seeing here ?  They said they filled 1 million prescriptions and gout isn't particularly rare.  Take your strawman somewhere else.
-	-	&gt;Market exclusivity allows a company to raise prices without fear of being undercut, and thus moves the pill back into profitability  This makes no economic sense. If someone was able to undercut them, then how was it not profitable? Someone else just figured out how to product it more efficiently.
-	-	[deleted]
0	2	The American way: Create a government body to supervise safety - make it corrupt as fuck - use this as justification to remove that supervision entirely.
-	-	Nope.  Open markets work to correct this problem.  Companies aren't going to produce the drug at a loss.  This will naturally lower the supply, which raises the price until the drug is profitable.  There is no need for a government agency like the FDA to artificially restrict supply unless they are protecting profits beyond what the market would normally bear.
1	6	The first paragraph that you typed is beside the point, first of all. Second, you people never ceased to amaze me. What ever happened to you tools always saying you want a free-market economy? The FDA should not be giving any big business any market exclusivity, period. 
-	-	[deleted]
0	1	&gt;Blame *market regulations* for cost of medical care.
1	8	TL;DR:  [Colchicine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchicine) has been used to treat gout for 200 years.  Upon submission of a randomized study, the FDA granted the manufacturer exclusivity which raised the price and eliminated all competition.    This will increase costs to state Medicaid programs from $1 million to $50 million.
-	-	US Healthcare is 98% Graft.
0	3	"Market exclusivity" is not a white and black area of morality.  Sometimes, the demand for a drug is so small that stops being economically feasible to produce it (you have to remember that beyond the chemistry involved, there is also millions of dollars in overhead such as shipping and storage to be considered). Market exclusivity allows a company to raise prices without fear of being undercut, and thus moves the pill back into profitability.   The danger is when a company manages to convince the FDA that something needs to be made exclusive when it actually doesn't.
-	-	Then that means that it's not worth it to produce the drug. No point in wasting millions of dollars of capital setting up production machinery for a drug that only five people can benefit from.
-	-	How does artificially limiting the supply solve this problem?  "Market exclusivity" can't make people pay more for the drug than they are willing to.  If there exists no supply at which the drug would be profitable on the open market than you can't make it profitable by restricting supply.
0	2	Isn't this is a clear example of the US not being a free market though? 
-	-	[deleted]
-	-	This isn't a herbal remedy, it's a very old and very widely used treatment for gout.
0	1	No, this is black. As black as you can get.   Colchicine has been used for many, many years for gout, a trial is not needed to know that it works, a trial is not needed to say that it can be very toxic, a trial is not required to define the side-effects that have been known *for literally a hundred years*.  If formal trials are done it should not be done in such a way that it increases the price for the poor bastard suffering from gout from *pennies to hundreds of dollars*. An absolutely tiny, one week trial with 185 patients? Why can't this be funded with a small government grant? People may have been using this medication for their entire lives, now many will not be able to afford it at all. This study has given no more information than we had already. That man does not benefit from this action in any way whatsoever, and neither does the many millions of men like him.  Black. Black. Black. I cannot believe the hand waving justifications in this thread, this as black and white as it gets, it's blatant corruption.  I'm sure glad this shit doesn't happen in my country that's for sure. Colchicine remains at $5 for a thousand pills, and the prescription costs for New Zealand citizens remains capped at $3 for however much they need.  That such as shit doesn't stop America from wanting, funding, trying, and lobbying to destroy our drug purchasing agency though!
0	2	There is such a thing as good regulation, and then there is corruption.  This is the latter, and America loves it like nothing else.
1	6	Do you have any examples of market regulation increasing the cost of medical care? Or could you explain how the proposed regulations I listed in OP would do anything but decrease the cost of health care?
0	3	Figures Isentrope had it twisted - maybe his unconscious(?) capitalization of 'Randomized' should have tipped me off. 
-	-	I just want to add that the trial followed just 185 patients for only 1 week, plus some healthy volunteers.   So I suspect that it was cheap.  A 100% sales tax on it for 1 year would have covered the trial, very likely, and would have funded a deserving university research department.   
1	8	lol, good point. I guess it's just that I don't feel that completely support taking away all regulation, just doing in a smart way that is advantageous to people who need health care.
-	-	[deleted]
1	8	&gt;Granted, if every firm but one manages to back out of production, you'll be okay. But realistically, that's not going to happen.  Why not? The better solution is for the state to pick the winner and disallow the others from competing? That's ludicrous.  If people refuse to pay prices high enough to keep any of those companies in business, then they'll refuse to pay the monopoly price as well and nothing was gained. None of what you've said makes any economic sense.  I'll tell you the real reason why the FDA has this program. It's to give incentives for companies to go back and study drugs that never were properly studied (by the FDA's standards). That's it. It has nothing to do with making sure drugs don't go off market as it guarantees no such thing. 
1	6	&gt;you don't believe in a modern free-market, you believe in a controlled market.  I believe in a free-market with minor controlled features.  I don't understand why I have to be for a free market or a totally controlled economy.
0	2	&gt;why not offset those losses against pills they can sell for huge profits. then i remember the answer... greed.  Uh, you do realize these drug manufacturing companies are businesses, right?  Are you seriously suggesting that a private company should willingly take a financial loss on a product line?
-	-	A free market only exists in textbooks. That's one of the first things you learnnpast econ101.
1	6	Has it ever been through a propper clinical trial to test it's effectiveness against gout?
0	2	Thanks I understand that novel drugs are difficult to produce due to the extreme risk, R&amp;D costs, and developmental time. Except you forgot that this compound is already well known and studied so there is no need to develop novel equipment for developing, processing, or producing it. This drug has already been approved by the FDA, and it was a question of whether or not the drug had tangible benefits associated with it or if it was homeopathic medicine.  I reread the top comment you responded to just to check that we are focusing on this drug and not all drugs.  Also I read http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/25/2/420.full.pdf+html and the title is slightly misleading. It is discussing "cost" as the opportunity cost of developing the drug, which is very different than the money spent. So I will give you an example:  Say you have a drug that costs $1 billion to develop over 10 years. Now lets say the investment is $100 million each year with an interest rate of 10% (they use 11%). This what your rate of return would be if you had invested the money else where. You can model this as an annuity and can calculate its future value (year 2021 dollars) and you get $1.7 billion dollars (in 2021). This is the opportunity cost to develop the drug in 2021 dollars.  Why do I keep repeating 2021? Because the number does not mean much until you convert it back to the current value of money. That would be the opportunity cost to develop that drug. However that is computed in terms of future value (10 years into the future). Seen as a current annuity the present value it is $614 million.  You see what I did there? I spent $1 billion over 10 years which is worth $614 million in present dollars. Or $1.7 billion in future dollars. Unless you make it clear how you are calculating the money it is a very deceptive number.
-	-	This compound has been widely used by doctors for 200 years.  If you go to your doctor they will prescribe an NSAID, prednisone, or colchicine.  *What you are talking about is not at all relevant in any sense whatsoever*
0	1	When I accused you of not reading my post, it was really just hyperbole. I expected, in reality, that you had merely *ignored* part of my post so that you could respond with a snarky comment.  Instead, by accusing me of ninja-editing in that part, you've revealed to me that you *actually* didn't read my post through before commenting. Regardless of what others might think, *I* know that I didn't edit in an entire sentence, which means that *I* know you dun goofed.  I'm embarrased for you.
-	-	&gt;Someone will pick up the demand after that.  Will they? Doesn't seem to be any guarantee of that, especially if the drug is spoilable and sitting on stock isn't an option. Many times it's better for a firm just to back out of such a turbulent market and move its resources to produce something with a steady profit like ibuprofin or something.    &gt;Why guarantee anyone profits in the short term?  The point isn't to guarantee short term profits - that's merely the effect. The point is to make sure rare drugs aren't taken off the market.  
0	5	Every time that I read about that corrupt FDA it always ruins my day. 
0	2	No, this is why _the FDA_ fails.  Get government out of the patent/copyright racket, get them out of the health care sector.
0	5	&gt;Sometimes, when demand is weak enough and cost of production is high enough, there simply isn't enough room for multiple firms in the marketplace.  ??? It's going to take some serious mental gymnastics for that logic to fly.  XM/Sirius situation does not relate at all. They wanted to merge but couldn't until the state allowed them to. XM was not trying to get the FCC to agree to disallow Sirius from competing. That would be ridiculous.
0	2	&gt;??? It's going to take some serious mental gymnastics for that logic to fly.  I don't understand what's confusing you. This is not something that is controversial or difficult to grasp.   Say there are only 1,000 people in the country who need the drug. In order to be economical, you discover that you must sell at least 700 batches of the drug (factoring in the price competitors are selling it for, how much you'd have to invest in production, how many batches are manufactured per cycle, and how much insurance companies are willing to pay when covering the drug). Because there are 3 other competitors in the marketplace, you find it unlikely that you will manage to capture that much of the market, and therefore you decide not to produce the drug.  Granted, if every firm but one manages to back out of production, you'll be okay. But realistically, that's not going to happen. You're going to have either an unprofitable struggle over market share, or everyone is just going to decide it isn't worth their fucking time and move on - there is, after all, many other drugs they could be producing with their limited resources.  &gt;XM/Sirius situation does not relate at all. They wanted to merge but couldn't until the state allowed them to. XM was not trying to get the FCC to agree to disallow Sirius from competing. That would be ridiculous.  They wanted to merge because they were effectively driving each other out of business. By merging, they effectively stopped competition, which is the purpose of exclusive rights to manufacture of a drug.
-	-	&gt;the movie studios do it all the time. remember the guy who actually played darth vader? it just takes a little creative accounting.  That "creative accounting" was designed to *hide* the *actual* profit so that they didn't have to pay anything. It's more or less the exact opposite of *actually* running a loss, which is what you seem to be advocating.  &gt;besides, there's always a middle ground.  Maybe, maybe not.   Forcing a company to "just offset those losses against...profits" is the antithesis of business.   Granted, as the products these companies produce *is* needed to save lives, the natural alternative would seem to be to nationalize the industry so that saving lives becomes the primary concern instead of profits. The problem with *that* is that the drive for profit is what's actually spurring the development of these drugs - remove the profit incentive and you'll have all the tylenol and motrin you need, but no revolutionary new stuff from thereon out.   So, we become stuck at an impasse. Continue on with profit as the primary incentive and let people with "unprofitable" illnesses fall by the wayside, or nationalize the industry, getting drugs to everybody, but running R&amp;D into the ground.  In the end, these monopilies on otherwise unprofitable drugs sort of become that middle ground you're talking about. It allows for continued profit and competition, but also gets the companies to continue producing low-demand products. Another option might be to simply subsidize low-demand drugs, but then you run into problems of potentially useless drugs being produced solely for the subsidy money.    
-	-	I assume it was some sort of grammar or spelling error, but since the edit was made yesterday, I don't remember what, exactly, it was. When I post from work, I don't have spell-check activated in my browser, and quite a few things slip by.   If I may say so, myself - go ahead and look back through my post history to see - I make fairly well-worded and well-formatted posts. I use a considerable amount of punctuation, and like to throw in italics and bolding from time to time. I then reread my posts once I've submitted them, and fix any blatant errors (which happen frequently).   I would also like to point out, that considering the amount of responses my post has received, and the amount of people who have seen it, it would have been fairly foolish of me to try and make a substantive change to it. 
-	-	[deleted]
0	1	&gt;The reason I didn't copy the next line is because all the critics have is well nothing. The only criticisms are "well we want more transparency". Please find me a valid complaint somewhere in there.  Haha. Some fucker comes up and says "it cost me $1 billion to do X", and you want to just take him at his word without asking questions? If someone says "yes, I'll believe you, but first please show me some numbers, prove to me that you spent it" then you dismiss the person as "just wants more transparency"? It's not more transparency, it's the fucking crux of the argument - the difference between blowing gas out your rear end and proving it.  You sound like some shill for the company, or else one of those weird people who believe business is good and the public is bad, even when business uses a government mandated coercive monopoly to skim the public.  I'd much rather believe an independent investigator who says "they spent $100 million and here are my numbers to show why" than a company that says "we spent $1 billion, trust us!". Fuck that.
0	5	&gt;The problem with that is that the drive for profit is what's actually spurring the development of these drugs - remove the profit incentive and you'll have all the tylenol and motrin you need, but no revolutionary new stuff from thereon out.  i fully agree and understand what you're saying there.  but the drive for profit energized by unchecked greed is what makes necessary drugs that cost a few cents to make cost hundreds of dollars a bottle for the patient.  &gt;Continue on with profit as the primary incentive and let people with "unprofitable" illnesses fall by the wayside  oh they wouldn't fall by the wayside.  those drugs would still get produced, just at such a high premium that the people that need them can't afford them.  it always blows my mind when at the end of some of the drug commercials, they put in the tagline of "can't afford your prescription?  {big pharma} may be able to help!"
-	-	Bailiff, escort the prisoner from the court room.
-	-	&gt;So how does this monopoly-enforcing system guarantee that?  Sometimes, when demand is weak enough and cost of production is high enough, there simply isn't enough room for multiple firms in the marketplace. If there aren't enough customers to keep two firms in business, both might decide the fight isn't worth it and pull out of the market. By awarding the exclusive rights to one firm, we give them an easy profit incentive to keep producing the drug.  &gt;How does it guarantee not to price the needy out of the market by those predatory enough to abuse the system?  It doesn't.  &gt;Edit: It would be interesting to see a study where the system actually worked as intended.  I don't know of a study done on drugs, but you can easily look to the example of Serious/XM radio. Both of them were in the red because there simply are not enough people interested in the product to support two companies. The choice was to either let them merge and become a monoply, or risk letting them both go out of business. 
0	3	You ignored the rest of my post that rebuffed the two studies you cited. Cheap and numbers mean nothing unless you specify how the money was spent or how that value is calculated. $1billion today is not $1 billion in 10 years. $1 billion in cash flow over 10 years is not equal to $1billion when that cash flow begins.  Your article explains acutely why drug research should not be a private enterprise  &gt; Well, then. That means that Pfizer, as the biggest and most-merged-up drug company in the world, must have minimized its risk more than anyone in the industry. Right? And they should be doing just fine by that? Not laying people off right and left? Not closing any huge research sites? Not wondering frantically how they're going to replace the lost revenue from Lipitor? Not telling people that they're actually ditching several therapeutic areas completely because they don't think than can compete in them, given the risks? Not announcing a stock buyback program, because they apparently (and rather shamefully) think that's a better use of their money than putting it back into more R&amp;D? I mean, how can Intel be doing better than that? It's almost like chip design is a different sort of R&amp;D business entirely.  The risk involved in the market is what kills companies like Pfizer. If they had enough money they could survive the swings, but when drug projects go up in flames it can destroy a company. It's why NASA pioneers space. Because without large funding and support by the government industries like SpaceX would have never seen the light of day.
1	4	While I am a free market supporter myself (and staunchly so, I might add), I have an anecdote that is relevant.  As a pharmacy technician it occurred about once every 2 years that a person would come in requiring a rare and expensive drug. Occasionally they'd only need 30 pills or so, and rare and expensive drugs never come in quantities of 30. Often enough, you'd need to order 100 or more. They'd sit on the shelf until they expired and we'd end up losing money. For that reason, we generally refused to order the drug, under those exceedingly rare cases, and these people had to go elsewhere. That said, mail order pharmacies will **always** provide those drugs.
1	6	&gt;This will naturally lower the supply, which raises the price until the drug is profitable.  And when a disease is so rare that the drug will never be profitable?
0	2	&gt;Granted what the FDA did was complete bullshit, but the exclusivity only exists for 3 years, which means it should be set to expire next year, at which point I imagine other generics will begin to come back onto the market.  No. The 3-year exclusivity is for the treatment of gout. In addition, they also received 7-year exclusivity for the same drug for the treatment of FMF, as the article mentions.  &gt;The drug company is making a lot of money off the compound, but it's probably invested a bit to have those studies done too. If they only make $1million, that would probably barely cover the cost of conducting the study.  No again. It's not a million dollars, it's hundreds of millions of dollars. Huge difference.  Again, what the article says is:  *According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, state Medicaid programs filled about 100,000 prescriptions of colchicine in 2007 and paid approximately $1 million for the drug. Use of the new brand-name colchicine could add as much as $50 million per year to these insurance programs' budgets at a time when they are addressing the rising costs of health care by reducing some services or raising eligibility thresholds.*  What they're saying is that medicare and medicaid paid $1 million for the drug in 2007, **before** the exclusivity was granted in 2009. As a result of the exclusivity, they will now pay $50 million **per year**. Over the 3 year exclusivity period that would be:  $50 million per years times 3 years = $150 million  Now consider that these are Medicare plus Medicaid payments *alone*, which are only a fraction of the total healthcare expenditures. Plenty of people pay for treatment through their own private insurance through Blue Cross or whatever. In 2009 when this drug was approved by the FDA, Medicare + Medicaid were [only 35% of US Healthcare](https://www.cms.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/25_NHE_Fact_Sheet.asp) - about $875 million out of $2.5 trillion. If you factor it over the entire US Healthcare system, then the cost actually comes to 150 million * (2.5 trillion / 875 million), which is 425 million dollars.  There is **a hell of a difference between $1 million and $425 million**.  Now, none of us knows what it cost the company to get the drug approved. However, the average cost to bring a *brand new drug* to market in the US is about $200 million. This includes all research needed to develop the drug, all clinical trials from Phase 0 to Phase IV, all legal and regulatory expenses. And this is for a brand new drug.  Colcrys isn't a new drug. There was no research cost to develop the drug, it already existed. There was no need for Phase I or Phase II trials, the drug was already being sold legally in the market. Only Phase III trials were needed, so the cost was a very small fraction of that $200 million. I haven't seen the numbers, but I would be very surprised if their total costs exceeded $5 million.  For a payoff of **$425 million**.  The New England Journal of Medicine is one of the most prestigious in the field. Consider what they have to say, without going into any specific numbers:  *Although the goals underlying the development of Colcrys were sound — few would argue against the need to comply with FDA requirements and the need to ensure the safety and efficacy of all prescription drugs — and the manufacturer seems to have followed FDA guidance, the reward appears to be out of proportion to the level of investment.*  This is exactly what the argument is about. That the reward is out of proportion to the investment, to the tune of 8500%, for something that brings "no meaningful improvement to public health".

1	8	Laws which make it a crime to sell pills labeled "Colchicine" which do not contain colchicine is government control of a market.  Do you think it should be up to each individual consumer to evaluate the quality and safety of the ingredients in each pill he takes?  Let people sell "prescription" drugs out of the back of a truck in some parking lot?  I agree that the events described in this NEJM article show how government regulation coupled with apparently unbridled greed on the part of a private company have hurt the consumer in this case.  To me, the solution is to change the regulations so that research and development is supported, but the patient is not gouged.  The suggestion made in the article, that the FDA foot the bill for clinical trials like the one that led to the temporary monopoly in this case, so that temporary monopoly is not justified and the consumer can continue to enjoy low-priced medication, seems to be a better solution to the problem than your "magic market" elimination of all regulation.
0	2	I am an adult, asshole, and I do not, under any circumstances, want the government to make decisions that effect exclusively my life, for me.  Google "non-aggression principle".
0	2	This kind of thing is probably to deal with the problem of effective old treatments which still need to be trialed. Have you ever heard the claim "XYZ is a fatastic herbal/natural/etc treatment for ABC but BIG PHARMA ignores it because you can't patent old herbal remadies."  well it's bullshit.  He who does the trial gets the patent. If you had the money and ran a trial to prove your favorite herb was a good treatment for something you could get the patent on it.  Hell if you find an out of patent drug and prove it can treat something new you might even get the patent on it's use as a treatment for that.  trials are very expensive but they're nesecary.

0	6	If the other supplier has such a large stock that they can just dump it on the market at reduced rates, then when no one is willing to produce the drug from scratch why don't they just sell it at normal rates, thus serving everyone and getting even more profits?
0	2	which makes me ask the question, if the demand is enough to warrant making the pill but not getting a profit on it (assuming that this is actually curing an actual disease, not just a "syndrome" and hauling along a bunch of other side effects with it), why not offset those losses against pills they can sell for huge profits.  then i remember the answer... greed.

The FDA had previously never approved Colchicine because it hadn't completed the Randomized study that you're talking about.  The drug company is making a lot of money off the compound, but it's probably invested a bit to have those studies done too.  If they only make $1million, that would probably barely cover the cost of conducting the study.
-	-	$1 billion dollars? You cannot honestly believe that. For comparison running the Los Alamos National Lab costs $2.8 billion (SOURCE:  http://www.nukewatch.org/economics/FYO8Budget/LANL_FY08Budget.pdf).  This study involved 185 patients over the course of 1 week. You could operate several fully staffed hospitals for that kind of money. And lets keep in mind that they didnt spend any R&amp;D devloping the drug, it was spent solely on testing and trial. There is ZERO reason that kind of study could not be run through the government.
0	1	The trial was fucking useless. Doctors now know nothing more now about Colchicine than they did before, but their patients now need to fork out *thousands of dollars* for something that should cost literally pennies.  I don't live in your country, thank god, and people here won't get fucked like yours will. I feel sorry for you I really do.
1	8	Recouping costs gone into research, development, testing, etc. It costs a ton of money to go from idea to actual drug, so if anyone can just come in and market the drug purely based on how much it takes to create an individual pill, then of course they're going to be undercut. Profiting off the sale of an individual pill =/= recouping development costs.
1	6	&gt;If someone was able to undercut them, then how was it not profitable?  Dumping stock to cut losses.
1	6	Next time, you might want to finish reading the post before you comment. Yeah, right there at the bottom, the part where I make essentially the same point you're making.  
-	-	It is profitable, at $5 for a thousand pills. That's how much we pay for it in NZ and the manufacturer is more than happy with that price.
1	8	&gt;Because if sick people need this to get well, the demand is surely there.  Demand may be there, but profitability might not.   If only 1,000 people in the entire country need the pill, it might cost more to make, store, and ship than they get back in revenue. Sure, they can raise the prices above the cost, but then without market exclusivity they run the risk of another supplier dumping their stock on the market at reduced rates just to cut their losses. 
1	8	This drug is profitable as it is. The rest of the world will continue to pay the free market price, which is ~1c a pill.

1	6	&gt;Second, you people never ceased to amaze me. What ever happened to you tools always saying you want a free-market economy?  Whosawhatsit now? Who's "you people" and when did I ever say I wanted a pure free-market economy? 
1	6	And some people claim the US has a free market...lulz. 
1	6	And imagine this could have been avoided if the US government deemed it beneficial to conduct the same study, but :socialism:, so a private manufacturer did it and now reaps the benefits.
1	4	I love the conservative mindset: rail against public option that would lower healthcare costs, rail against patent buying that would lower the cost of drugs for everyone in the country, rail against states and the country banding together to buy drugs in bulk to lower healthcare costs. Blame liberals for cost of medical care.
0	1	That is not relevant to Colchicine. It is already on the market. This study was absolutely tiny, only one week long. You are wrong, very wrong.
-	-	&gt;Except it can cost anywhere between $500 million and $2 billion to bring a drug to market.  Except that it doesn't. The [published figures from the pharmaceutical industry itself](http://healthcare-economist.com/2006/04/29/802m/) average out to $802 million per drug. This was for an average of 68 drugs from 10 different drug companies in the US.  However, a lot of people [think this is bullshit](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2630351/). These numbers come from the pharmaceutical industry, which has an interest in inflating the costs to defend high drug prices and long patents. They have consistently **refused to share this data** with independent investigators, so there is no proof other than their own unsupported word.  You pasted that $500 million to $2 billion figure [directly from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development#Cost):  *A study published in 2006 estimates that costs vary from around $500 million to $2 billion depending on the therapy or the developing firm.*  but failed to paste the very next sentence:  *Critic Marcia Angell, M.D., a former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, has called that number grossly inflated, and estimates that the total is closer to $100 million.*  That's not only bullshit, that's dishonest.  A number of studies have been done by independent doctors and researchers, not paid by the drug companies. The commonest estimates I have seen are $100 million to $200 million, and I picked the higher number for my previous post. Until the drug companies release actual data showing how they spent $800 million or $2 billion on a drug, I call bullshit.
1	6	Better yet, just a simple university research grant - for such a tiny study it would have costed far less than a million dollars, let alone *hundreds of millions*.
0	2	While that's a matter of contention, it's what conservatives (the ones who actually have an understanding of conservative economics, anyway) will *actually blame*. This couldn't have happened in a free market.

1	6	So they dumped their stock. Someone will pick up the demand after that.  Why guarantee anyone profits in the short term?
-	-	&gt;Recouping costs gone into research, development, testing, etc.  That is a separate issue entirely. This was a drug that was already widely produced and used. This company conducted a study so they could cut out all competitors for a set period of time.
1	6	Out of curiosity do you beleive patents and copyrights are anti-thetical to free markets?
1	6	Yes. What's your point?

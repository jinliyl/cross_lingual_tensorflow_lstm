Known for the black "sayyid" and beard to match, the young cleric was identified by the Pentagon in 2006 as the biggest threat to stability in Iraq. His militia became the most active and feared armed Shi'ite group, blamed by Washington for death-squad killings of thousands of Sunnis.").  If you've seen the documentary [Death Squads](http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/dispatches-the-death-squads/), it's about al Sadr's ethnical cleansing of sunnis. In short, the guy's grade-A fucking scum and one of the worst war criminals in the Iraq war.

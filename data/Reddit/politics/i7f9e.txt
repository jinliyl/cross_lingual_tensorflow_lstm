0	1	I'M REFERENCING THE PEOPLE BRKELLO WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT DID NOT COMPLETE COLLEGE!!!!
0	1	Are you serious?  You're a [fucking imbecile](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/06/us/first-black-elected-to-head-harvard-s-law-review.html).
1	6	Yes he was elected president of law review but nowhere in the article are the connections to fellow classmates.  As far as I know no one has come forward as a friend/classmate. Kinda weird.  just one link http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2390835/posts  &gt;I don't have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obama at Columbia. Ever! Nobody recalls him. I'm not exaggerating, I'm not kidding." Root adds that he was also, like Obama, "Class of '83 political science, pre-law" and says, "You don't get more exact or closer than that. Never met him in my life, don't know anyone who ever met him. At the class reunion, our 20th reunion five years ago, who was asked to be the speaker of the class? Me.  No one ever heard of Barack! And five years ago, nobody even knew who he was. The guy who writes the class notes, who's kind of the, as we say in New York, the macha who knows everybody, has yet to find a person, a human who ever met him. Is that not strange?  It's very strange." Obama's photograph does not appear in the school's yearbook and Obama consistently declines requests to talk about his years at Columbia, provide school records, or provide the name of any former classmates or friends while at Columbia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Allyn_Root#column-one  NOTE: Root graduated as Valedictorian from his high school, Thornton-Donovan School, then graduated from Columbia University in 1983 as a Political Science major (in the same class as President Barack Obama WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN IN). 
-	-	Doesn't mean they are alike.  Obviously, the branch Obama came from must have got the intelligence gene since he was actually able to graduate top of the class in Harvard.  Palin has a sketchy college record at best and Limbaugh is a college drop out.
1	4	I realize we're ALL related, but it's just funny to see the link.
1	6	Palin's record may be sketchy but Obama's is non existent.  And nobody remembers him. Not one classmate buddy. Not one. Very bizarre.
0	2	College does not quantify intelligence.  See Einstein, Albert; Gates, Bill.  Please do not construe this as me defending Palin, she's an idiot.
1	4	HAHAHAHAHA.  [God you're an idiot.](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/06/us/first-black-elected-to-head-harvard-s-law-review.html)
0	2	You don't graduate *magna cum laude* from Harvard as the president of the *Harvard Law Review*, and garner the sort of praise from professors Obama did, without being smart.  If you don't think he's incredibly intelligent, you're an idiot.
1	6	In what way did you read my comment as saying this?
1	6	Show me the public record to back this claim. Where is the school record of such an accomplishment.
1	8	brkello:  &gt;Obviously, the branch Obama came from must have got the intelligence gene since he was actually able to graduate top of the class in Harvard.  you:  &gt;College does not quantify intelligence.
-	-	So show me the Colombia or Harvard classmates that remember him.

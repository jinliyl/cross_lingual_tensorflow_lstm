0	1	those god-damn poor people stealing food!
0	5	In MN, one of the rules is that you have to be working at least 20 hours a week to get them.  So if you are unemployed for a long time, you're screwed.  I was out of work for about three months, and during that time I ate dandelion greens, wild garlic, and whatever I could find in dumpsters (which was itself illegal, but what was I going to do) supplemented by occasionally spending a tiny amount of my saved cash on a bargain-bin thing.  
0	1	Maybe the WSJ should do a story about banking and Wall Street fraud and how it has cost the world economy trillions of dollars. No screw that lets pick on poor people.  Besides the states make the rules as to how and who get food stamps. I know of some states where if you have a bank account with $300 in it and a $500 car, you do not qualify for food stamps, basically meaning you have to be desperately poor to get help.

1	8	Don't be so hard on the WSJ. The first sentence in the article says, *"Millionaires are now legally entitled to collect food stamps as long as they have little or no monthly income."*  
1	6	which states ?

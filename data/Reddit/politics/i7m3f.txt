-	-	We already have strict laws and policies against this...      The response we'll see is changes in enforcement.
0	2	During my little vacations over the years I've often seen a rooms full of cops trying to figure out how to get pictures off of their digital cameras. Cops are stupid and the government is cheap put it together and you get fail.
0	1	They can also just snatch your phones gps data without a warrant without a single fuck being given. Hell cops can run people down in the street and get off scott free. Imagine what the feds are up to? :3
0	1	I was going to say they're dumbasses for thinking SB1070 is a bad law, but that too.   They've done more good than bad so far IMO, but to say SB1070 is racist (in a negative way) is silly.
0	1	The fact that people think LulzSec is an activist group is sad. The fact that Redditors who should know better think they are is sadder.  They're not activists. They are just fucking with people to create a sense of distrust of social institutions. It's embarrassing that people eat up their paper-thin hypocrisy and champion it. You give a sense of credibility to people who deserve none, for things they aren't doing. Nothing they're doing is activism. They've been the first ones to admit that precisely what they are not. And yet, you add perceived morality to the vacuum and thank an anonymous power with no checks for something that they aren't doing, even by accident.  Morons.
0	2	Yes indeed.  Now they need to hack into the Federal Reserve and release all the secret bank bailout bullshit and show proof of just how corrupt that sector really is to all the non-believers.
1	8	Unfortunately, they've lost a lot of the gaming communities support after hacking Bethesda and taking down EVE and Minecraft.
0	3	It was coming either way. look up HBGary. look up operation payback.  I'm sure I'm going to get downvoted to hell for saying this but only by people to lazy to find out what's even going on. This started with Wikileaks and it ends with the fate of the free world.
0	1	I really enjoy that everyone is raising their voice about lulzsec being some lowbie group of hackers but NO ONE has taken the time to prove so. Fuck even if they are, why does it even matter? Does that discredit them somehow? Have they ever come out and said that they were some super elite group? Nope.   The fact is that they are acting while others aren't. If it's so easy then other people would be to. And don't reply with "BUT ITS AGAINST THE LAW!!!". Well they haven't been arrested yet because they are doing it right. So apparently there is no reason other people cant as well right?
0	2	a lot of hate and violence spewing from your posts there 
1	6	I'm liking this new era of activism. I think the world needs more of it in order to keep the powers to be in check. 
1	6	The important question that will probably get buried under the media rhetoric: why do law enforcement agencies and governments, in this day and age, not properly secure their info systems?  Some of the 'security efforts' that have been 'hacked' in the past few weeks border on negligent.
1	6	did anyone see the picture of the suv with the 50 cal in the back of it?
0	2	Well they do have some anonymity when their riot masks are down, badges hidden, and they're just hitting/smacking/dragging people in a peaceful protest crowd.
0	2	I agree.  If there's nothing wrong going on, then there's nothing to hide.  Public servants should be held in scrutiny by the public, every action should be accountable.     The fact that public servants want their actions and intentions hidden from the public belies their contempt for the public that they serve.
1	6	&gt;LulzSec leaks Arizona law enforcement papers  &gt;LulzSec leaks  ?
1	6	Why not hit two birds with one stone? Catalogue people's access to the International Citizen's Information Services AND charge them money to do it?
1	6	Who doesn't, at this point?
0	2	Yes, all cops are spineless evil villains.    None of them joined the force to do the right thing.  None of them are working there because they want to make a difference, nor working to get a paycheck to support a family (because cop benefits are pretty decent for jobs that don't require a college diploma.)  For a community that touts itself on being intelligent, diverse, and accepting, I have seen few other organizations completely demonize an entire profession quite as swiftly and callously as Reddit has done with police officers.  I understand that there's corruption in the system, and that there are a lot of bad people who are given power that shouldn't have it.  That doesn't allow you to endanger everyone involved because you're angry.  PS. I'll be honest, I was pretty distraught by what you wrote so I started reading through your comment history.  Seriously, supporting the rioters in Vancouver?  "I'm cool with theft so long as it's from a big business?" I don't mean to make this into an ad hominem, but seriously what set you off to indiscriminately hate every organization of authority?
-	-	Guess what holland just did
0	5	True. We need to start considering information security as important as physical security. That is the way the world has moved. For a government to shell out billions on planes, ships, and overseas contractors is absurd when the same government won't hire an IT guy in each data-driven office for ~60-80k /yr.
-	-	To be fair, they were going to do this anyway. At least there are lulz to be had.
1	6	Sorry, but are you responding to my post? Have you read it? I have said none of the things you accuse of. In fact I say nothing about lulzsec, I blame the people who were in charge of securing the stolen documents. 1	1	6	Imagine what the Feds have always been up to.  
1	6	First of all, still waiting on that info. (Also, if it's so easily available on google then why not just give it to us?)  A. you could come to my house and shoot me, rape me, vandalize my house or my car, rob me, stalk me, harass me, prank call me, send me spam emails, hack into my email, stalk my family, harass my family...that enough? B. having something available on google and releasing cops' information very publicly are totally different things. C. Are cops not required to identify themselves if asked?  Even if not, then this is something you should take up with your legislature, not by compromising the safety of individual officers.  I have two problems with your last point.  One, if it's so bad then move out of Arizona.  Seriously, people are more mobile now than ever before. Two, it doesn't make sense.  How does knowing a police's home address let you "police the police?"  It doesn't, unless you're willing to kill them, in which case, see my point A.
0	2	Police can ask me for my address and put me in jail for not answering them. I think there's nothing wrong with holding them to the same standard. It's the perfect opportunity to put the age old cop question "if you've got nothing to hide then why aren't you cooperating?". So, cops, If they have nothing to hide then they should have no fear of this information going public. 
0	2	This is true. The blame for SB1070 lies on Arizona legislators and Arizonans who supported it. It was unpopular among the police themselves.
0	3	I'm not sure what you're saying here. The police could easily track me, so I am *not* enjoying anonymity. Furthermore, I am not exempt from the law thanks to the "Blue Code of Silence".
1	7	A. I have no method of oppressing you, a policemen does.  B. These potential oppressors have every ability to get these things, hell you could if you used google.  C. Policemen are under no real threat of retaliation from the populous, as we are unable to go request information, a warrant, or even an address about them.  Given these things, the only way people actually have of policing the police and watching the watchers is if they are given the same info. As a resident of Arizona, where the law enforcement is particularly heinous for a number of reasons, I don't give a rats ass if your anonymity has been compromised, because ours already is.
0	2	Chaotic Evil   Chaotic Evil is referred to as the "Destroyer" or "Demonic" alignment. Characters of this alignment tend to have no respect for rules, other people's lives, or anything but their own desires, which are typically selfish and cruel. They set a high value on personal freedom, *but do not have any regard for the lives or freedom of other people*. They do not work well in groups, as they resent being given orders, and usually behave themselves only out of fear of punishment.   After their "Titanic Take-Down Tuesday" and releasing all those passwords, that definition seems to apply.
0	2	Which line of yours is sarcastic?  You might be confusing sarcasm with gallows humor. And I'm prettty sure you're the creepy one, trenchcoat boy.
0	1	Nope it works!   http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sheepish
1	6	&gt;You know how we hold people accountable in the United States of America? LAWS. ELECTIONS.  How's that working out for Jose Guerena?
0	2	when the entire system is broken steps need to be taken outside of it in order to create real change. The extent of change needed is probably where we differ. I think it's time for a Revolution, and Revolutions by their very nature cannot occur from working with the despots in control. Lulsec (even though many aren't American) are the true patriots in this day and age. It should also be noted that wikileaks had a team of people looking over all the information released so as to not put american troops in danger. They also released the information through respected journalists who could give more information on a story. Since the frame up of Assange, and his house arrest (without charges) is now entering 200 days it should be expected that other groups will take up the fight for transparency. Since they turned Assange into a criminal they've now created many smaller groups willing to fill the void. It's the same backward approach the US takes in its global war on drugs, take out one cartel and then watch the violence spread. The US made this shit bed and now they have to lie in it. Lulzsec are only the first, and this will never end so law enforcement must get used to the hackers having the upper hand. 
1	4	I appreciate you taking the time to craft a long, rational post.  While I can't help but disagree with the majority of your second paragraph, I admire you for it.
1	4	Yes. Holding *every public official*, and especially those elected, is the *only* way to run a proper government. Anything less and you're descending into a fascist dictatorship inch by inch. The more scrutiny public servants come under, the better job they will do.
1	4	I've understood everything.  It's you who keeps reeling from exposure.  Now you conflate a desire to expose corruption with "want[ing] to see the world burn."  Such rationalizations can lead to evil acts.  Honestly, I'm sorry I teased you.  I hope you can connect with someone and talk about these things in person.
0	5	A. Not without retaliation from the police. Comparably, a policeman will get a slap on the wrist for most of those things.  B. Very publicly? When I get back to Tucson I'll start asking how many people heard about this.  C. Identification gives me, what, a name? Going through the legislative system is itself a problem which I'd be willing to argue against if I didn't have to rehash it as many times as a biologist rehashes evolution to a creationist. Suffice to say that if a system is corrupt, trying to fix it through its own corrupt ways is not likely to work.  Finally, it doesn't take violence to harass policemen and let them know what they were doing was wrong. Could you imagine the effects of waves of hate mail washing up on your doorstep because of your job? That's good enough to get a lot of people looking elsewhere for employment, and probably more effective than looking to legislatures.
-	-	"well maybe they do, i don't know, but that's not at issue here"  That is exactly the issue here.
0	5	Yes. Holding *every public official*, and especially those elected, is the *only* way to run a proper government. Anything less and you're descending into a fascist dictatorship inch by inch. The more scrutiny public servants come under, the better job they will do.
0	1	Worship these guys all you want, but when new security laws come out in response to this crimespree don't say I didn't tell you so.  What do you expect to be the result of this ego-driven spree of leaks? You really think we gain so much information about the world from a bunch of pedestrian documents from 'Zona PD? We're not learning anything we didn't know before and it's clear that Lulzsec isn't in it for "activism" but for the e-respect they get for 'taking on the man'. This is childish bullshit and I'm not surprised at how many of you are complete suckers for it.
0	1	&gt;We are targeting AZDPS specifically because we are against SB1070 and the racial profiling anti-immigrant police state that is Arizona.   These guys are dumbasses. The **Arizona Department of Public Safety** is not the border patrol or Sheriff Joe's MCSO. They are basically highway patrol. If they come across illegal immigrants, they do not arrest them or detain them. Border Patrol or ICE will do that. They patrol highways, assist stranded motorists, investigate accidents, compile crime statistics for Arizona and compile police studies (like infiltrating Nazi groups). If LulzSec wanted to do something constructive, they could have targeted crooks like Sheriff Joe. **Fuck them**. SB1070 isn't even being enforced by any state police or judges.
0	2	No. Private home phone numbers are crossing a line. Police and even Politicians have a right to a personal life. As long as they have a way to be contacted and can be held accountable, they're entitled to privacy in their personal lives. It's their public lives, such as actions while on patrol on statements made regarding a political issue, that need to be publicized. Furthermore, committing a crime or doing wrong by a law-abiding citizen is something that they should be held accountable for and under no circumstances should their position get them preferential treatment. Whether or not they're attempt to abuse power is worth of harsher treatment is arguable, but they definitely should not get off easy.
-	-	There's clearly an aspect of Chaotic Evil to them.  Their willful and pointless humiliation of innocent people on the basis of it being 'funny' to them indicates that pretty clearly.
1	7	But the cops dispatched to "track you" would of course just be doing their jobs, and they'd be paid for it. When the tables are turned is when they get upset. 
-	-	&gt;They are already ignoring the citizenry  Except the citizenry in this case is in favor of the bill.
1	6	Exactly, i'm saying the cops do not have anonymity either. 
1	7	hey man,   mind giving us your phone number, home address, full name, email address, email password, spouse's name (if any), and email address? Oh and where you work as well? All we want to do is freely distribute it to tons of people on bitorrent.  Thanks,  A person enjoying anonymity on the internet
0	1	Way to be a fucking creep.  I make a joke about how fucked up the world is, and you turn into Captain America.  Learn what sarcasm is.
1	6	Funny how you can't even get my quote correct. Typical. Have a nice life here on reddit. 
-	-	It may be a word, but it doesn't mean what you think it does.
-	-	&gt;Godwin's law applies especially to inappropriate, inordinate, or hyperbolic comparisons of other situations (or one's opponent) with Hitler or Nazis or their actions. The law and its corollaries would not apply to discussions covering genocide, eugenics (racial superiority) or other mainstays of Nazi Germany, nor, more debatably, to discussion of other totalitarian regimes,or ideology, since a Nazi comparison in those circumstances may be appropriate. Whether it applies to humorous use or references to oneself is open to interpretation, since this would not be a fallacious attack against a debate opponent.  I think you're cool this time.
-	5	but it's not theirs to release. Thus, it is a 'leak' of documents that weren't supposed to get out.
-	-	It got leaked *from* the government of Arizona *by* LulzSec.
1	6	I don't know about net neutrality but it definitely gives ammunition to people who want to curtail/eliminate the anonymity of the internet.
0	2	If i remember correctly indiscriminate killing of civilians has lead to the loss of every major guerilla war in the modern age. Such examples would include, Vietnam, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Chinese civil war. 
0	1	Sadly, you speak the truth. LulzSec needs to get the fuck out.   I guess they released the email addresses and passwords to porn accounts for the benefit of watching porn, too, right?
0	3	It just might be that some of the people in lulzsec  just want to see the world burn.
-	-	*Chlorine* tablets.
1	8	Thank you. I mean, it's really no different than stringing up tax collectors who were just acting on the king's orders back on the old days. Someone has to do those jobs. As a current telemarketer I know people don't like mine much...
0	1	Again, what a crock of shit. Your friends can only go to sleep at night because "I'm just doing my job." Maybe when they're in actual danger they'll grow a fucking spine and stop supporting evil shit like this.
0	2	Net neutrality has been fucked for years now. We'll never get it. Stop clinging to that one small dream that will never happen.
0	2	&gt;I'm all for LulzSec  Then congratulations; you're an idiot!  Lulzsec is, at best, neutral. They've fucked over innocent people because they thought it was funny. They don't serve your agenda. They don't serve *any* agenda. They act according to whatever whims they've chosen for the moment, and they represent the Internet and web culture *incredibly* poorly. When the government starts really pushing for things like Internet IDs, this will be the sort of thing they point to.  So far the vast majority of their "hacks" have been technically unimpressive hack work like SQL injection. They're nowhere near as good as they think they are, and if they piss off the wrong people the NSA *will* end them quickly and harshly.
0	1	What a crock of shit.  You know why police officers don't worry about the fact that they enforce brutal and disgusting laws? because they're afforded anonymity and unaccountability unlike the rest of the public. If the people with a state-approved strong arm feel like they're in actual danger from the public, when they feel like their lives are on the fucking line, they'll be like the rest of us.  So no, leak their addresses. The moment they can't just repeat the mantra "I'm just doing my job." Is the moment things change.
-	-	&gt;the release of their personal information completely undermines LulzSec's assumed high ground.  It really doesn't. If this qualifies as 'terrorism,' and it might, then so does the police profiling against those of central and south american descent. 
1	4	Thank you for injecting some common sense into the argument.
1	6	Lulzsec is going to war with the global elite. They hacked the gaming community to get attention alright. They need every eye in America watching this and it worked.
-	-	No, they did that for the lulz.
1	6	[Obviously this is a new phenomenon](http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/11477) and [it's not like this has been going on since the advent of the internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick). No amount of regulation and no number of draconian laws will ever be able protect people from their own stupidity. The government has been trying to noose the web for decades now and thanks to mass ignorance this time it might work.
-	-	Everyone with a friend.
0	1	"For a community that touts itself on being intelligent, diverse, and accepting, I have seen few other organizations completely demonize an entire profession quite as swiftly and callously as Reddit has done with police officers."  Because police officers CAN and DO completely fuck up peoples lives, and you hear about it weekly.  They have so much power and there are examples of it being abused over and over again.  If police don't want to be vilified, then it's time they clean their own house.  If they did their job with good intentions, their emails, and memos, and inter-agency communications would be mostly boring to the public and people would move on.  Instead, there is a seed of corruption in most police forces in the United States, and the so-called "good cops" seem unwilling to do anything about it.  You may have friends in law enforcement, but I grew up in a cop family, so I have seen and heard cops regularly bending or breaking the law most of my life.
0	2	I will first say that I agree with you on the first point, I understand some people wanted to do the right thing, I even thought of being a cop myself. However, in the end, I could never work as a policemen or as a bank teller because my job means contributing to a largely evil system. I can't just choose to enforce the laws I want and ignore the bad ones, and since your friends can't do that either, they're choosing to enforce evil laws, and that makes me rather ambivalent to their emotions on the issue.  As for the authority, I guess I grew to hate it over the course of a few years in high school. I used to be a big Randian capitalist. However, after reading a lot of books about social-democracy, which lead to books on democratic socialism, which lead to books on anarcho-syndicalism, now I have very little sympathy for most people in the system. You try to educate them on the evils of it and they turn a blind eye. They'd rather ignore suffering and blatant evil that they are involved in. Capitalism and the government are intertwined so thoroughly, that it would be accurate to say policemen essentially enforce the desires of the rich and powerful. Rich people own jails and cigarette and liquor companies after all. So they can command the politicians to command the police to throw pot smokers into jail, rich people when, poor people lose. And so long as police serve the rich, so long as they're the knights of the god-damn feudal lords, I don't care how nice they are in person, their ultimate loyalty is to an enemy.  
1	4	Dear internet hacking groups - this is how you gain supporters.
-	-	[This is what has been going on and why it is happening](http://operationblackouthq.blogspot.com/2011/06/wikileaks-lulsec-anonymous-and-why-it.html)  
0	2	&gt;Chaotic Neutral is called the "Anarchist" or "Free Spirit" alignment. A character of this alignment is an individualist who follows his or her own heart, and generally shirks rules and traditions. Although they promote the ideals of freedom, it is their own freedom that comes first. Good and Evil come second to their need to be free, and the only reliable thing about them is how totally unreliable they are. Chaotic Neutral characters are free-spirited and do not enjoy the unnecessary suffering of others, but if they join a team, it is because that team's goals happen to coincide with their own at the moment. They invariably resent taking orders and can be very selfish in their pursuit of personal goals. A Chaotic Neutral character does not have to be an aimless wanderer; they may have a specific goal in mind, but their methods of achieving that goal are often disorganized, unorthodox, or entirely unpredictable. 
1	8	Depends if they have a hierarchical leadership. If they are like anonymous then they are more like an idea rather than an actual group. Different individuals will take individual action which they are personally accountable for. That's also how anarchism works, there may be a collective objective however everyone is responsible for their own actions. 
0	2	While I agree with your contention here, I do have a problem with this line:  &gt;And regardless, these are people with families doing their jobs. Not some faceless government entity.  I do not know who else to reference other than Lewis Black: "People act like government is a big building, with arms and legs, walking around doing shit."  Government *is* people; those are people with wants and needs who succumb to base human emotions that are signing these things into law. While the police should not be the target of this operation, maybe their involvement will get the ball rolling on fixing the problem. They are already ignoring the citizenry, and even the police not enforcing the law does not change the fact that it is still highly enforceable. 
0	3	Heh you can wear a mask but the feds can follow you or just track your phone without a warrant. You can proxy up but their reach is global. No one is truly anonymous and no one is safe.
1	6	EDIT: innawoods replaced his entire comment, which consisted of "Everyone who is a fascist - FTFY."  My original reply remains below.  Is that what it means to you to have a friend?  Should the police be checking out your notebooks?
0	1	Sorry to prove Godwin right (once again).. but isn't this the whole "Nazis were just following orders too" argument?  Plus many of those officers were in support of SB1070.   Wikipedia:  &gt;Arizona's law enforcement groups have been split on the bill,[35][92] with statewide rank-and-file police officer groups generally supporting it and police chief associations opposing it.  &gt;However, the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, which represents the city's police officers, has supported the legislation and lobbied aggressively for its passage.  I don't condone the posting of personal information by anybody and definitely think LulzSec is just going after anybody and everybody.. but if SB1070 is the motivation, then that's proper justification IMO. Who better to punish than the group that would've sheepishly [TIL sheepishly is actually a word] enforced, supported, and been used as a model in other states to pass the same laws. 
0	5	You know, you're right about that.  I was thinking that they had to consult the public before they made a decision, but that's not necessary for them to be held accountable.  Fair enough.  Although I still don't think that releasing private information is the same as holding them accountable.
1	4	Thanks, this was really late at night, and when I woke up, I can only be appalled at my spelling. Seriously "Rich people *when*, poor people lose."
1	6	How?
-	-	dude 4 months ago called. they asked for their reddit topic back.  This isn't about wikileaks.
0	2	If lulzsec was able to get their hands on that information, every, yes every other group, hackers or not, that sets their mind to it would have been able to get that information.  The news here is the major failure of protecting sensitive information, next to the outstanding stupidity of AZ (US) law enforcement policies and even greater stupidity of the enforcers.
1	4	I love this, what's even better are that these people are ready to teach everyone how to do this sort of thing.
0	3	We should remember we live in a golden age for online activism. One day these people will realise that a guerilla war is being fought. They know how to fight against a guerilla war; indiscriminate murder of civilians. I will not be surprised if that is not how they respond to this 'hacking'. One day the hacking community will have its own My Lai, luckily things have not reached that stage yet, before they realise we must expose them!
0	1	I may have had some 'sympathy' for lulzsec at first... but now... fuck them.  I hope they get caught and are raped in the ass in prison.  Lulzsec only did this because AZ had weak security not because of any righteous bullshit 'racial profiling' bullshit that they are spewing in their press release.
0	3	i've said it before and i'll say it again; these people will cost us net neutrality.
-	-	Information belongs to the people; like Shakespeare or aspirin.  -Milo from Anti-Trust
-	-	*pulls out note pad* "Chlorien tablets and rubbing alcohol" ...this should be neet.
0	1	Fuck this, fuck LulzSec, and fuck anyone who thinks this is cool or admirable or anything other than horribly invasive.  I have friends in law enforcement and banking who I honestly feel terrible for because they're constantly vilified despite not doing anything beyond work hard at their low-level jobs.  How the fuck anyone can cry foul about PATRIOT ACT and government spying but think this is some novel endeavor is beyond me.  "First they came for the communists," etc.
1	6	I agree, Not sure why someone down voted you.
1	6	How the fuck is this a leak?  Lulzsec intentionally released it. They didn't *"leak"* it. 
0	3	I understand somebody who got high and is pissed a cop caught them and arrested them for breaking the law might want to abuse this information. I'd honestly rather see the cops not have access to your address without a subpoena or a court order of some sort than to have their address published as well. Sure, they may be a great guy and a decent cop, but sooner or later a criminal might decide to make it personal, and I'd rather not have anyone or their family endangered in the name of full disclosure. But I do agree that a single consistent standard should be upheld and applicable to all citizens, regardless of job or position.
1	8	OK, being that you are unable to understand, here is my point.  There IS corruption on a mass scale. I don't see where it is wrong to hope that corruption gets exposed, because once the corruption is outed, we can move on to improvement.  Even though this group may be going about it all wrong, AT LEAST we can hope they expose some real scandal, and some actual justice and GOOD comes out of the mess.  Trenchcoat boy?  Not hardly, JIDF. Go back to your video games.
0	2	THANK YOU, People don't understand the internet has been under attack sense 9/11, and i won't stop being censored until its stopped.
1	6	What came first the chicken or the egg? Operation payback was a response to anon's 'hacktivism', lulzsec is just an extension of this same type of online criminality.   You can't just say *welp it was going to happen anyways*, no...these laws and cybersecurity firms weren't needed until people decided to engage in shady activity.  
1	6	They did it to get every ones attention and I'd say it worked. It's like putting up a giant billboard...or a bat signal depending on how things go ;) 
-	-	[deleted]
1	8	Because leaking the names and addresses of police officers isnt "activism".
1	6	what about redditors who used to be /b/tards and now get a pang of nostalgia at the sight of fresh lulz?
1	8	Because he just talked in favor of Lulzsec. R/gaming is still pretty upset at their targeting of game companies, especially Minecraft. They are attention whoring and releasing personal information. Some think they are a plant to usher in new web censorship laws. To get to my point, they shouldn't be releasing all this info to prove their point, there are better ways. The above positive portrayal of Lulzsec disagrees with some of the hivemind.
1	6	Possibly because they put multiple officers in danger by releasing their personal information?
1	4	I'm guessing some people feel salty about how the information is obtained. I don't. I'm all for LulzSec and organizations like WikiLeaks. The people should know what the law enforcement is doing. I think activists just got fed up with law enforcement hiding behind *National Security* to cover up their questionable actions. This is how groups like LulzSec is born.
0	2	I didn't downvote but this "activism" crosses a line when personal addresses of police officers is released. The police force didn't pass SB1070 and the bill isn't even being enforced. LulzSec is punishing the wrong group here. Those officers and their families had nothing to do with SB1070 and the release of their personal information completely undermines LulzSec's assumed high ground.
1	4	Finally. Glad to see them doing more than DDoS'ing and grabbing e-mails from members of the gaming industry and are moving on to something practical.
0	2	&gt; Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTOs), are using available GPS technology to target rivals. DTOs are placing GPS tracking devices on load vehicles of their rivals to reveal stash house locations, in order conduct home invasions raids to steal drugs and money on a later date."  Gee, it's too bad the courts have ruled that it is perfectly legal to put a tracking device on someone's car, even without a warrant or other authority. I guess that means if you want to prosecute these criminals, you'll have to wait until they execute their home invasions. 
1	8	Not every cop in Arizona is an asshole racist and releasing detailed instructions on how they use informants to infiltrate some pretty nasty groups while providing names and addresses seems pretty reckless.  
0	2	Did you miss the part about [SB1070 not being enforced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_SB_1070)?  &gt;The day before the law was to take effect, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction that blocked the law's most controversial provisions.[23] Arizona has sought, unsuccessfully to date, to reverse that decision in the federal appeals courts.  Did you also forget how the branches of the government work? Police enforce the laws that the legislature passes and the governor signs.   And regardless, these are people with families doing their jobs. Not some faceless government entity.  
0	1	That's ironic seeing as you are the one that is enjoying anonymity. If your life is on the "fucking line" I don't think you should be making comments against the state-approved strong arm. They could very well track you!
0	1	What a crock of shit.  You know every arrest, every ticket, every traffic stop, every report is stamped with an officers name/badge number?  Every time an officer makes a stop and radios dispatch it is logged.  Police have no anonymity.   They may not have as much accountability as we would like but there is accountability.  A police officers home address/phone number/password/personal email is COMPLETELY unrelated to topic at hand.  You want to make a statement about this retarded law?  Release the logs showing officers racial profiling.  Release the arrest records showing officers just arresting Mexicans.  The police officers had nothing to do with passing this law.

0	2	"If there's nothing wrong going on, then there's nothing to hide."  Except when you do need to hide things... like state secrets.
0	3	Releasing cell phone numbers, private email addresses and home addresses is not transparency.  It is dangerous.
1	8	I just don't understand why you would say something like this. at all.  Police officers' private information--phone numbers, home addresses, spouses, spouses' email addresses--do not need to be publicly available on the internet for the public to hold them accountable.  You know how we hold people accountable in the United States of America?  LAWS.  ELECTIONS.  These police officers don't want their actions and intentions hidden (well maybe they do, i don't know, but that's not at issue here), they want their PRIVATE INFORMATION hidden.  That's not unreasonable. And although I disagree with police actions from time to time, I for one think that these disagreements should be settled by COURTS and LAWS.  I also disagree with Arizona's laws.  But that should be settled again by more laws and elections.  Also, do you really think holding "every action" accountable is a good way to run a government?  I mean, you think it's inefficient now...just imagine what it'd be like if officials had to clear every action with the public.  There's not enough red tape in the world...
1	6	I don't understand the problem. Someone has to have done the leaking, right? The government didn't want the information getting out, but someone with access to it worked with LulzSec to leak it out and release it.
0	2	EDIT: for clarification.  The above poster is content with his daddy's money, and his video games, and his mommy's basement, so he doesn't want anything to change inside his little bubble, because nothing affects him, therefore it is easy for him to pigeonhole me.  He either thinks everything in the world is bright and rosy, or likes it the way it is.  "nothing harder than trying to get someone to understand something, when their paycheck depends on them not understanding it."
1	6	So the global elite is zeus hiding fire (read: liberty) from humanity and lulzsec is prometheus who steals it back for us but is ultimately banished for his slight against the gods?

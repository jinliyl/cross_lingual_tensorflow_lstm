0	3	Public sector unions and the TSA....Literally a combination of two horrible ideas. 
1	4	Great, now we'll never get rid of them.
1	6	How come TSA gets a union but not walmart?
0	2	great. I can't even imagine what worse service from the TSA even looks like. full on smirking and giggling during the groping? the line is closed for our union designated 1 hour lunch ? no TSA, so no flying on holidays ?
1	8	Always good to see working class Americans join a union.  It is good for all of us in the end.  Thankfully, anyone not choosing the luxury of flying commercial never has to deal with these people; so even if you are against them, you are free to avoid them - thus making their searches and seizures not "unreasonable" as defined by the constitution.
1	8	Unionization isn't the problem with the TSA, and it won't add to the problem, since it's very specific -- their searching procedures are unconstitutional and should be challenged. Here's legislation that would help with that:  https://secure.aclu.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&amp;page=UserAction&amp;id=3091&amp;s_subsrc=110414_tsa_abuses&amp;JServSessionIdr004=kw2g3lrpd6.app226a
1	8	Actually I think this could be the first step to a less strict TSA. The union could file charges of forced sexual harassment because they are forced to touch someone they don't want too. 
0	3	Oh, no, we'll be able to get rid of them, so long as three supervisors sign off on it, at least 3 documented and un-appealed complaints, spend 6 months on paid-leave status, have their firing approved by a panel of peers, and don't have seniority.

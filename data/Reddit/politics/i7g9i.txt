-	-	And you would be just as correct.
0	2	Honestly im getting tired of the govt banning/regulating/controling every aspect of our lives.
0	2	Don't get me wrong I agree that they are intruding way too much.
0	1	THE RIGHT TO BARE BATH SALTS!
0	1	Just because one thing is banned that shouldn't be, doesn't mean that other things deserve the same treatment.  Also, you don't have a constitutional right to get high stated in the Bill of Rights. 
-	-	_real_ assault rifles are already heavily regulated. rifles which fire one bullet when the trigger is pulled that look scarier than the other rifles that fire one bullet when the trigger is pulled don't need more regulation.
1	8	You dont have to have an assault rifle if you dont want  one. Thats the law.
-	-	Because that won't make the assault rifles go away magically.
0	1	Because a lot of people don't think we should have one. It's not a question of "Can we," but of "Should we?"
0	1	No, because when the founders said that "A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State" they meant that civilians must be allowed to own assault weapons to shoot squirrels, neighbors, and beer cans.
0	1	No typical street thug criminal carries around an assault rifle. Most people who do have them have them legally and use them responsibly.   The biggest problem with guns is not the guns them self but the idiots who get their hands on them. How about we just have a restriction on stupid people instead?
-	-	In some parts of Sweeden and Switzerland and in Kennesaw Ga it is required that every citizen posess a firearm.
1	8	I can say the same thing about the Bath salts.

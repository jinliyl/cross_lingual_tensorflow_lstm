0	2	He's also an angry, abusive little asshole who tries to intimidate guests and refuses to let people with *strong* contradictory positions to voice them properly.
-	-	You weren't really clear on that.
-	-	this right here is a prime example of why succinct wording is important
-	-	And he says so during the interview. Bill Maher does the same thing with his own guests. Comedy has become the most reliable source of complete ideas.
1	4	Sometimes TDS makes cuts, but I've never heard anyone, left or right, say they were edited poorly on The Daily Show. I honestly think TDS has higher journalistic standards than most (if not *all*) 'legitimate,' news outlets.
-	-	ya know what, perhaps it's all the above. 
0	2	I'm sorry, but I really am NOT surprised considering the statements he used to START the interview. Don't get me wrong.. I totally agree with you all and this is first time I've ever seen an interview with this guy. He was rude from the start and made it hard to watch with out wanting to nerf bat the guy to unconsciousness. 
0	3	Take it easy, guys - this guy is very angry.
0	1	Again, you avoid the difference between bias and activism and distortion.   Strawman.  This is not a matter of liberal v conservative, though that meme is handy for arguments as specious as yours. It's reality v distortions. 
0	6	do you have webbed feet?
0	6	You don't like the idea of pulling our troops out of Afghanistan or decriminalizing marijuana on the Federal level? Those are two of Ron Paul's political positions that Chris Wallace has used to paint him negatively.
-	-	Watch Shep Smith sometime.
0	1	Damn, and after all that respect Stewart was giving him on his own show.  I guess he was wrong to give him the benefit of the doubt.
-	-	I believe that as a condition of Jon Stewart being interviewed on FOX, he stipulates that the whole unedited version of the interview be posted on line.  Of course, FOX won't say that, **THAT** is the reason that there is an unedited version of the interview available at all.
0	4	Wait for the ending haha
0	5	Sad but hardly surprising. Fox isn't even a news station, it's just a large propaganda machine.
0	1	I love that the guy who called a team of black women "nappy-headed hoes" is making a racial issue out of Jon Stewart mocking Herman Cain with a cartoonish voice. Nobody but the writers at Fox News even perceived that in a racial way, and that speaks volumes about how seriously these idiots take a black candidate. As if to say he's not a politician with a voice, he's a *black* politician with a *black* voice. Bitch please, get over it.   And what's with conservatives' love of the victim role? I swear, I can't remember the last time I heard Palin, Beck, or anyone else at Fox talk for more than five minutes without looking for a shoulder to cry on in response to this cruel, harsh world they face. Again...bitch please.
-	-	I was ingesting this conversation between between Imus and Wallace when I realized it was taking place on the Fox Business Network a.k.a.  Fox Lite.
0	6	Does no one else love that Imus brought up Jon Stewart's "Amos and Andy" voice, and how no one else could get away with it?
0	2	Show of hands: who expected MORE of FOX?
1	1	He doesn't want to do that. Ideologically, he doesn't see a need for these things but realistically he does. The only difference is that Ron Paul wants to pay for these things with money that is not printed out of thin air or borrowed from foreign nations. Ron Paul proposes INCREASING funding to Social Security, Medicare, Welfare, Foodstamps, all domestic social programs. He just wants to pay for them with real money and not debt. To do this, you stop sending out billions in foreign aid and you stop global wars of occupation. Ron Paul also wants to eliminate taxing social security, welfare, unemployment as though it was income. Particularly in the case of Social Security, people already paid tax on that money when they were young, why are they paying a double tax on their savings? I hope this cleared some things up for you.
-	-	Kids thease days -.-
0	2	They edit it so they'll get traffic on their website.
-	-	He just believes in sound money- money that is backed by a commodity like gold or silver.  It is not quite 100 years that we have had the Federal Reserve central banking system here in the USA and it was as recent as Richard Nixon that we came off the gold standard.  
0	1	&gt;"It was still 14 minutes, which was longer than we had intended, and **if you want to watch the full interview, though I can’t imagine why anyone would.**"  Yeah, who the fuck wants to watch Chris Wallace on Fox News interview anything
0	2	Why does Jon go on Fox?  He should insist they air the interview live or not edit it.
0	1	Has there ever been major fallout from a news organization pulling the same kind of propaganda shit (or worse) that fox does?  
-	-	[deleted]
-	-	&gt;I think when you state that history and facts have a **natural** liberal bias  I don't think you understand what the whole 'facts have a liberal bias' thing is. It originated mostly from a comment Colbert made. It's when facts don't agree with conservatives, sometimes they blow it off as a 'liberal bias'. Since facts/reality prove the conservatives wrong, and they consider it to just be 'liberal bias' then facts/reality = liberal bias.  It doesn't mean liberals can't be wrong or are inherently right. It's more about the conservatives being wrong and getting called out for it. Example:  Sarah Palin makes a retardedly non-factual statement and then the media corrects her. It's not that she's wrong, it's the 'liberal media bias' out to get her. Because as we all know, facts have a liberal bias.
-	-	You are completely missing the point of that statement.  I'll spell it out for you, though: he's making a statement that matches the absurdity of the media having a "liberal bias"--that, if that is a so-called "liberal bias," then life itself has a "liberal bias."
-	-	But they naturally do. As we are naturally a more liberal society now than in the past, historical facts and interpretations will have a liberal bias.
-	-	It is known.
1	4	Happy bireddithday!
-	-	I agree, but also think that even people watching fox news need to see firsthand (even through the smoke screen) that he's more legit than anyone on the fox news network. 
-	-	"Reality has a well-known liberal bias." —Stephen Colbert
0	1	This is true. I have conservative 'friends' that call facts a left point of view, when all they are are facts. Stewart does bring a little bit of a liberal slant, but yes he does seem to be more logical than trying to push an agenda. He wants to call them on their bull shit which needs to happen. 
-	-	Was able to with O'Rielly depends on which show, i guess.
-	-	Not if he can point it out and expose them for doing it. Which he has.
1	8	While he may not be a "ideological, partisan activist", the man does have *ideas*.  Ideas that are larger than just poking fun at cable news because its an easy target.  Remember the Crossfire interview?  I don't think he did that for ratings or to gain credibility.
-	-	Ratings.
0	2	Because they always manage to prove his point even as they do everything possible to prevent that.
-	-	It gives him something to make fun of on The Daily Show.
1	8	He goes on to face them instead of hiding away like Glen Beck does. It helps show he stands by what he believes and is open to being challenged.
-	-	I think John decided that he could get on because he has interviewed most of them and that way he can bring an actual left-sided argument to the debate even for just one day. 
1	4	In a bashing of what you consider biased media, you took us to a site whose tacking is "Real liberal media."  Good job.  [suitable Fair and Balanced, My Ass!: An Unbridled Look at the Bizarre Reality of Fox News](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568583478?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idenprop-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=1568583478).
-	-	I hope people can self-reflect like this (not "only a comedian") when they read accounts that end up sensationalist, like the one linked to on politicususa.com. For example:  &gt; You need to see the big picture in order to understand that what happened on Sunday wasn’t only about Fox News trying to keep evidence of their bias off their network. This is also a campaign to delegitimize Jon Stewart. Fox is pushing the message hard that Stewart is a secret liberal activist with a political agenda.      &gt; Fox News feels threatened by Stewart, and they are trying discredit their foremost critic.      The fact of the matter is that Stewart does have liberal views. I don't think he denies that. Is he **pushing** a liberal agenda? Eh, I don't know. He seems to give more time to conservative jokes than liberal jokes. But that may simply be due to conservative jokes being easier and more common.      As someone with a mix of conservative and liberal views, I know that when I tune into TDS I am getting a humorous critique of the entire landscape. Sometimes I'll see Stewart deliver a bit of a tirade more than a joke, and I'll find myself disagreeing with what he is saying. But his willingness to have an open honest discussion (with guests, and as a guest, more than the monologue) is what brings me back to watch TDS and not Fox.
1	6	How do I get a slice of that tasty cake?
-	-	So say we all.
0	5	The only response to that maddening crap re "I'm entitled to my opinion" is "You are entitled to your own opinion but not to your own facts."   Can't remember who said that now. The good news is one of the latest polls showed Americans trusting Fox less and watching more PBS news. I can't believe how long it takes us to wake up sometimes. 
1	8	This this kind of passive-aggressive and underhanded bullshit that keeps me from ever completely respecting Wallace. 
0	1	GOOD REGURGITATION! BUT I DISAGREE! 
-	-	I think when you state that history and facts have a natural liberal bias, on more than one occasion too, that you might be pushing a liberal agenda somewhat. 
0	1	Again, the issue is not bias, it is distortion. The two are not necessarily equivalent.
-	-	There is a serious flaw in your logic. You said any "news organization..." Fox News, despite the name, is NOT a news organization. This is what we need to focus on. They are nothing more than the propaganda arm of the oligarchy that is trying to take America away from the people. Instead of knit-picking the details of their "reporting" we need to expose them as being no more truthful in anything they do than The Onion.
0	2	My argument is that aligning yourself with any party is a waste of time and that it distracts from learning about the individual candidates for office. But feel free to continue.
-	-	&gt;You don't think anyone on Reddit is honest? Not even one person? Wow.  I'm in another thread right now where a liberal reddit guy is explaining to me that it is OK for Obama to avoid congressional approval for the war in Lybia because Bush did the same thing. (Bush didn't. Congress authorized both Iraq and Afghanistan.) In a different thread I had a liberal explain to me that because we have no troops on the ground, Bombing the shit out of Lybia doesn't count as war.  And while I agree that Palin is not impressive even in the full interview, she complains about editing and everyone laughs. Stewart complains about editing and everyone here says "STEWART IS RIGHT!"  So yes, the hypocrisy I have seen so far on reddit leads me to wonder if anyone here is honest.  Stewart's answers were not taken out of context either. Stewart knows as well as anyone, you only have a set amount of time in a segment. If the person you interview talks for 24 minutes, and you only have time for 14... cuts will be made. I find it even more disingenuous that a guy like stewart, who has hosted a talk/news show for 10 years, would pretend he doesn't understand how his comments could possibly be edited.  
0	5	I agree with you completely in principle. I just get tired of the outrage. "FOX NEWS LIED!" Yeah, I know...they know too...everyone with a brain knows. The thing is, the people who believe their lies are not, I guarantee you, logging on to Reddit for an intelligent discussion.
0	2	you do realize it is a comedy show vs. what calls itself a "news" network?  I mean the station is called Comedy Central....
0	2	It's extremely snide and prejudiced; and frankly, expressing such a harsh opinion is beneath the profession of a journalist; but we all know if you work for Fox News you're a fucking tool.
1	8	It's not a personal issue though. There's a whole other world of thought that's completely independent from me and I think it's arrogant to assume it'll collapse if you ignore it. Those people have their own motivations, they fund themselves, and some of them are friends, family, and coworkers.  Ignoring it may change the tone of Reddit, but it doesn't fix the problem.  Posting on Reddit might not seem like an effective solution to you, but I get a lot out of the debates people make on these boards. It's extremely difficult to talk about politics offline because both parties generally have the ability to poorly reference a much larger store of information than they really understand (the collection of sites or shows they visit/watch).  When I read the debates on here the odds of having been exposed to the information they're referencing or viewpoints they're presenting is much greater, and it's helped me reason with people and move conversations that would have dead-ended forwards. 
1	6	Seriously? They put out the entire Palin interview and she looked worse than she did in the edited. That said, her interview was not edited to distort. Her answers weren't taken out of context. She looked bad because she thought healthcare was part of the bailout (that she supported, by the way). She looked bad because she couldn't answer what she read. She looked bad because she got tripped up when asked what she did that day.   You don't think anyone on Reddit is honest? Not even one person? Wow.
-	-	Jon Stewart stopped pointing out absurdities some time after the 2010 elections. Nowadays, the man seems to be more political than usual. At this point, I think Jon Stewart should move on to other projects and let Colbert handle political satire. 
1	6	Not exactly. I don't watch Jon Stewart or Chris Wallace. Or any other TV really, for that matter.   Is there anything else you'd like to assume about me?
1	4	Actually, the way I see it, His smirk is more of a "I'm getting paid to be an asshole" kind of smirk. He can be as stupid or as smart as he likes, be as mean or as nice as he likes. He knows that in the end, after editing is all done, he will look like the calm smart guy while anyone else will look the fool.
0	5	I hate the way he talks to Ron Paul. He is responsible for spinning Ron Paul's positions into a negative light.
0	2	Fox news disgusts me
0	2	Wallace is such a smug prick.  
0	1	The Imus reference didn't tell you that? Did *you* read it?  Plus, duh, you moron, I'm not criticizing the facts, but seriously, how can everyone fucking complain about Fox when *this* kinda shit happens here everyday. Just goes to show that Reddit doesn't really give a fuck about objectivity. Unscrupulous.
-	-	All I'm saying is that if you want to prove a conservative news station's biased (which I'm sure Fox is). Link to a website that doesn't pride itself on being liberal, the opposite of conservative.  That's like me saying. Look Jews suck (from nationalsocialistsnewssource.com)
1	4	&gt; I believe that Fox News Sunday contains about 44 - 48 minutes of content without commercials. The unedited interview is 24 minutes long. That's half of their news program in a week when more actual news happened and they had more interviews and panels to conduct.  One should note that Jon Stewart has taken to doing the exact same thing all the time now. His interviews go long, he airs part of them on the show (the show only has 22 minutes) and then tells viewers to watch the rest on the web.  Although he just airs the first 4-6 minutes and *doesn't edit it*, which is still a pretty big difference.
1	8	Perhaps I phrased myself poorly. What I mean is that they deliberately edited specific parts of the conversation to misrepresent what Stewart had to say, while claiming in the same interview that they're Fair and Balanced™.  They didn't need to keep the *entire* thing for Jon's points to be properly represented, but they don't want that proper representation.
0	2	Yeah, I see what you're saying, but don't you think he undermines his message to some degree because Fox does edit him?
-	-	I think that's the larger issue. Ideas. 
1	4	Besides, the full interview is always put on The Daily Show's website. Stewart even reminds people about it when it's obvious an interview they're doing will be too long to completely air. 
0	2	The only difference between Fox News and the daily show is that they're both selling ad time.
1	8	I'm aware of how post-production works. You can't use everything you shoot, even if it's all good and you want to.  &gt; How they edit it is the problem.  It's that.
-	-	[Relevant.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/22/hannity-offers-to-be-wate_n_190354.html)
1	4	In a bashing of what you consider biased media, you took us to a site whose tacking is "Real liberal media."  Good job.
-	-	Pfft. Imus is wrong, but I'm downvoting because... seriously... Politicususa.
0	2	The Fox News organization is trolls working for posers.  The only way they can handle the truth is to bury it.
-	-	Classic Conservative tactics!
0	2	Stewart should return the favor in kind. A whole episode filled with edited clips of the Fox cronies so they can see what its like to be edited in such a way that makes them even bigger assholes than they already are.  I'm talking completely obscene edits, from different interviews and time periods, strung together so that you have Glenn Beck saying, "I'm a huge dick" or Megyn Kelly saying, "My crabs are worst case ever seen in the United States."
1	4	Wow. Jon Stewart is something.
1	8	It's not exactly a big shocker that Fox News edits interviews in a way that make their people look good and promotes their greater agenda. But I think there are few things being brushed over here:  * Most edits are made for time considerations and not because of some underhanded desire to silence the voice of opposition. Most of what Fox cut out was inaudable rabbling between Stewart and Wallace that, quite frankly, needs done more often on Fox News. * The Daily Show is the king of editing interviews to promote a specific view on things. Every single segment on that show is edited for a laugh at the expense of someone they're interviewing. Agenda-driven or not, Stewart has very little ground to stand on when it comes to arguing that he was unfairly censored when his show is doing the exact same thing. If editing for comedic value isn't promoting a degree of the sensationalism Stewart complains about, then I don't know what is. * That being said, Stewart and The Daily Show seem to try harder to let their guests speak during the actual "live" interview on the show and make it known that the full interviews can be seen online immediately. Fox, in my opinion, does not do this.  TL;DR Fox News, though obviously biased, may have had legitimate reasons for editing the interview. Stewart complaining about this is like the pot calling the kettle black.
1	6	When you all say Jon Stewart, you mean his writers, right?
-	-	Everyone that goes on Fox News needs to simply require, if they are "left", that all interviews go live instead of taped. Problem solved.
1	8	As an long time film and video editor I can see what he means. Sometimes their is a great take you just have to cut down to meet time and sometimes because you want to put so much into the piece you are left with cuts that are less then what you wanted. that's not saying that the editor wasn't subconsciously biased, it happens all the time.  for example, why most doctors in movies are male and nurses are female, The director or casting agent didn't even think about it, its just how they saw it in their head. 
-	-	Hodor?
1	8	Because he believes in being civil, which means talking to people you disagree with.
-	-	As I mentioned elsewhere, Stewart demands as part of his agreement to be interviewed on FOX, that FOX provide an unedited version of what was said on the Web.  
1	4	Agreed. 
0	2	I'm sure they have some kind of implicit reciprocity agreement. Stewart probably wants the fox people to come on his show where he can corner them and/or boost his ratings.
-	-	Remember, both are two sides of one coin. They're getting paid to get you to watch ads, nothing more.
1	8	Don't watch them harder.
1	8	I think that so many people vehemently disagree with Stewart (and others like him) that having him on their show is a ratings boost simply because "those" people expect to see Stewart trounced in a debate.  Regardless of the outcome of the debate, "those" people will feel Fox News will have "won."  Possibly also lends to the credence of their "Fair and Balanced" tagline.
1	4	The godawful shit-eating grin on his face when he tries to condescend to Stewart makes my stomach churn 
1	4	I believe that Fox News Sunday contains about 44 - 48 minutes of content without commercials. The unedited interview is 24 minutes long. That's half of their news program in a week when more actual news happened and they had more interviews and panels to conduct.  Don't get me wrong, I fucking hate the shit out of Fox News too, but this is a very simplistic way of thinking. The issue wasn't that they edited the interview at all, it's how it was edited. Namely, they cut out the 10-second reference about how Fox News receives "marching orders", giving Jon no context and making him look more like a loony than a reasoned person. Much like how you appear like a loony for insisting the only reason the program would have to edit an interview was to effect a different opinion, rather than to cut down on time.
1	8	Zero news organizations would have aired it in full.  Whether this excuses Fox or indicts the media I leave to you.
-	-	Echo 
0	1	Damn Stewart. He worded things so well that they were having issues even making him look bad, but themselves instead.  Doesn't he know he's supposed to hand them material that they can work with to push their POV? ;)
0	1	He's also an angry, abusive little asshole who tries to intimidate guests and refuses to let people with *strong* contradictory positions to voice them properly.
0	2	What does Fox get out of having Stewart on any of their shows? Do they actually think they come away looking like the winner anytime he does an interview with them?
1	4	I actually think his greatest coup here was against HuffPo.
-	-	\*Jon, just FYI
0	1	He's also an angry, abusive little asshole who tries to intimidate guests and refuses to let people with *strong* contradictory positions to voice them properly.
-	-	Echo
-	-	hear hear!
-	-	It is known.
-	-	True.
-	-	you get one on your yearly reddit birthday
1	8	I agree with your point, but I don't think he is bringing a left-sided POV, but rather a reality based POV. It's interesting that we all now assume that left = reality....... since right/Fox too often = distortions.To clarify, I didn't hear him advocating for left policies or ideology. He seems to care more about being reasonable than being left. He brought up the Fox emails that prove that they have marching orders and agendas for their lineup, and that is what they edited out. 
-	-	When the news can't be made funny, there's funny news to be made.
1	6	But does he really if he gets edited?
1	6	The Jon Stewart interviews at CNN or Fox have been more about criticism of news coverage and less about particular political positions. He had his beef with CNN on the cross talk debates about the legitimacy of the debate show. In the same vain, he has asked Fox to admit they are pushing an agenda rather than call themselves "Fair and Balanced". I am not sure what is left or right about his main criticisms in these cases.
1	8	Wallace says he wasn't witty enough to challenge Jon Stewart on comparing himself (Jon) to Murrow or Twain...but that's completely irrelevant because Jon specifically said at his "highest aspiration" and he no doubt used that phrase for the specific reason that he *didn't* want to compare himself to either.
1	6	"They're *not* ill-informed?"
0	1	And Chris Wallace *still* hasn't been waterboarded for charity since he raped and killed that girl in 1996!
0	2	FOX is for cowards.
-	-	Of course they do.
1	6	TIL Chris Wallace is Mike Wallace's son. How did I not know this before?
0	2	Yes, because if your point takes more than two minutes to explain, you're 'filibustering.'
1	6	Anyone have a link to the email he was talking about?  I'd very much like to read it.
0	6	Imus is still on TV? Figures Fox would give that racist prick a home. Really goes to show you what their demographic is. 
1	6	I know this has nothing to do with the editing, but does anyone else have a problem with both Chris Wallace and Don Imus bringing issue to Jon's portrayal of Herman Cain with his "Amos and Andy" voice. I mean for Don Imus (of the famous "Nappy headed hoes" comment) its an astonishing level of hypocrisy, but even for Wallace its strange that he brings up this point when he works for a network that once ran with headlines such as "Outraged Liberals: Stop Picking on Obama's Baby Mama!" I just don't think anyone on Fox news can play the race card after Obama...
0	2	Ron Paul's policy ideas are responsible for putting Ron Paul in a bad light.
0	2	I think it's more of an "I only have this job because of my dad and stepfather" type of smirk.
1	6	Don't get me wrong, I love marijuana and hate wars as much as the next responsible young adult, but there's more to Ron Paul then that. Some of it is pretty quirky..doesn't he have a gold fetish? 
0	2	&gt;You don't like the idea of pulling our troops out of Afghanistan or decriminalizing marijuana on the Federal level?  And he likes puppies and kittens.    BUT he still wants to get rid of the Safety nets, Social Security and such, SO I don't like him.
1	8	Yeah, it's not like Game of Thrones is popular or anything. Um, I mean: **THE KING IN THE NORTH!**
1	6	Dude, that was going to be my guess! Also, what do you do when you have to go real bad? Are they *quick release* laces?
0	2	Your friend is retarde--- oh wait you did say he was a conservative.
-	-	[deleted]
0	2	Exactly, all news organizations need to be called out on it. If we didn't live in dumbfuckistan we could have news on the shows like CNN instead of celebrity gossip. Go back to having the actual news and not leaning one way or the other. I don't understand what is so damn hard about that.   And it really is disgusting when you're debating with someone and even after you present facts they're just like "That is your opinion and I have mine, not going to change it". Aren't we suppose to base our opinions on facts not what the bible says or what ever fear story they read...  Edit: added second paragraph. 
0	2	Your friend is retarde--- oh wait you did say he was a conservative.
1	4	I LOVE watching Bill and Jon interview each other. You can see a great deal of respect between the two. They both have very different points of view and have great discussions when on each others shows. 
1	8	Yeah, over all O'Reilly isn't bad. But sometimes he is just over the top and crazy, but only part of Fox news i respect (just a little).
0	1	Chris Wallace is a smarmy-lookin asshole. He's the kind of person I just want to hit whenever I see him smirk. And I'm not even a violent guy. It's just that his face expresses "I'm just being an asshole because I like being an asshole". And that attitude is exactly what he's doing with Jon Stewart. Fuck you, Chris Wallace.
0	1	By repeating the same claim after the interview where Jon refuted that suggestion, isn't Wallace proving Jon's point?   I mean, maybe the Chris Wallace on talk radio isn't the same Chris Wallace on Fox news, and doesn't have to adhere to the same journalistic integrity.  It's a blatant omission from the conversation, and harms the public by willfully ignoring what transpired.
1	8	The catch to all of this is remembering who the audience is. Most of the people watching Fox are not tech-savvy to say the least. This is how they will demonize Stewart for being on their station.  Edit it down for Grandma and then post the full version online so they can claim no responsibility for having to edit down interviews. They INTENTIONALLY let it run long so they can butcher it up, get him as tired and flustered as possible.  And then for the curious conservative with a computer, they remind you that you've already seen everything there is to see. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
0	1	&gt;He's the kind of person I just want to hit whenever I see him smirk. And I'm not even a violent guy.  You sound more like a jon stewart watching type of person, and you appear to be pretty clear on the marching orders he's given you.
0	1	That surprised me as a remarkably low and rude thing to say. Why would you say that about your own interview with your own guest? Not to mention one that was very interesting? 
1	6	What. A. Dick. Wow.
0	1	Poor liberals got 14 minutes of Stewart instead of 24... How will you ever live?  I'm curious, how many of you laughed at Palin when she complained about having her interview edited, but now are upset that Jon was edited? Anyone? Anyone honest here on reddit?
1	8	I KNOW YOU ALL CAN'T WAIT TO SUCK JON STEWART'S DICK BUT THE DAILY SHOW IS PROPAGANDA JUST LIKE FOX NEWS. DEAL WITH IT.
0	3	Hmm... I wonder if there's a single conservative on reddit...
-	-	&gt; He seems to give more time to conservative jokes than liberal jokes. But that may simply be due to conservative jokes being easier and more common.  Jon Stewart specifically states in several interviews throughout the past decade or so, including this past Sunday, that what he points out is absurdity.    It just so happens that many of the positions taken, statements given, and news presentations that provide us with incredible absurdity are those generated by the far right.  Notice that he rarely spends time on Wallace's programming while discussing Fox.  By the same token, he rarely points out absurdity at NPR.  But when either source presents a target, he hits it fairly.  This is not to deny that he has a liberal slant in his view of the world, and that this may influence what he finds "absurd" - but i happen to also find the noise coming from the back of the right wing to be far more consistently and loudly absurd than the noise from any other fringe.
1	8	Chris Wallace misrepresented Jon Stewart again.  He said in this interview that Stewart claimed that he was "just a comedian".  Jon Stewart actually corrected this very exaggeration of Chris Wallace during the interview.  He said he wasn't and never had said he was "only a comedian".   
0	2	Okay, I already don't watch Fox. I guess I won't watch them even more now.
-	-	&gt; The reason that anybody has seen the full version is that we put it out. We weren’t hiding anything.  If they had *wanted* people to see the full version they would have broadcast the full version the way a legitimate news organization would have. The only reason they broadcast the edited version they did was to effect a *different opinion than people might have gotten had they seen the full one.*  The pipe dream is over Fox. You can't have it both ways. You can either be a legitimate news organization or you can be propagandacists. Pick one.
-	-	Well, certainly on his show he can do that, but not on Fox is my point.  They edited that part out.
1	8	Ouch. Re-reading it, I'd have to agree.
0	2	I was recently presented with some crappy letter-to-the-editor from a right-wing paper that was decrying Seal Team 6 for not including any [long list of minority groups here] in their team.  At first, i was incredulous that someone took this position.  But the list included fat people and handicapped people.  I looked at my friend that presented this and said "okay, clearly a joke. i was worried for a moment!"  He shook it under my nose and told me "Why do you think it's a joke?  Those are *your* people.  That's what *you* believe!"  Sometimes the conversations aren't worth having.
1	8	O'Reilly always insists that the full unedited interviews be posted online, and he mentions this several times. He's just about the only person on Fox News who is resonably fair. (But still unbalanced as he admittedly leans to the right)

1	8	Couldn't agree more- they need to be called out on distortions. It's the calling facts "liberal" that just sends me over the moon and we've all started to accept the premise that there are 2 sides to reality and there are not 2 sides. This is how they get away with selling evolution is a theory. It boggles the mind when they equate their opinion with expert knowledge and expect it to be taken as 2 sides. 
0	5	I mean...I would argue that life DOES have a liberal bias.
0	5	Either this is a really obscure Song of Ice and Fire reference or I need to stop assuming everything has to do with what I am currently reading.
0	2	I have very little interest in GOP - Democrat politics.  The point was that credibility goes down when you link to a site that will, as an opponent, try to make the other side look bad.

1	8	That's a nice strawman, but bias is not the same thing as having an activist agenda or distorting the truth, which is part of Stewart's point.   On Fox, they claim to be fair and balanced while serving as activists for the GOP. They donate millions to the RGA (and do not disclose this) and have every Republican 2012 candidate on as contributors, hosts and analysts save Ron Paul. They also allowed candidates to fund raise on the air during 2010 elections. Name another network that has done that.  Why don't you specify a criticism of the article rather than claiming it's biased. 
0	1	Your comment reads exactly like all of the Digg Patriot comments on Digg  re PoliticusUSA articles. Not saying you are one, but you should try coming up with a criticism of the facts.  Did you even read the article?  
-	-	Editing for comedy is not the same as editing for news.  Apples to Giraffes comparison.
1	8	I don't know that it's hypocritical for a comedian to edit an interview in pursuit of comedy while being upset that a news program (especially a "fair and balanced" one) edited an interview to portray him or his apparent political position in a negative light.  I agree with you that many of the edits were probably motivated by time rather than ideological concerns, but it does appear, to me at least, that *some* of them *were* done due to ideology.  For that smaller portion, I think Stewart certainly has adequate grounds on which to cry "foul."   e:  missing parentheses
0	5	You're not alone; I was surprised, too. I guess the apple *has* fallen far from the tree.
-	-	&gt;waterboarded for charity  Actual laughter was produced.
0	2	Wallace has the red ass because he was outdone by a guy who did nothing more than **speak the truth**.  He admitted he has a liberal slant.  He admitted he's a comedian on a network that sometimes does lowbrow comedy.  He admitted he's sometimes been out-of-line in calling conservatives "racist".  He admitted his schtick is not new.  He even pointed out Faux's viewers are the most consistently uninformed people that watch cable news.  Wallace couldn't win a battle of wits with a guy that left his in the car.  Goodness, he's a douche.
1	8	Faux News is utter shite, but you're really attacking them over what is actually an industry-wide practice. TDS and Colbert even cut up interviews.   How they edit it is the problem.
0	5	But it *is* worth the effort.  They spread misinformation to a huge audience, and even some on reddit may not realize it.  Any news organization should pride themselves on informing its viewers in an unbiased and truthful way.  When they mascarade themselves as being unbiased and truthful and then in fact lie or skew facts, the public should be made aware.  It hurts the public to be lied to by such a large media corporation with as much influence as they have.
0	2	Feel free to make a coherent defense in their absence.
0	2	You know, every time Fox News does something biased and unethical, every time they spread some blatant lie, everyone gets all up in arms until it dawns on them that THIS IS WHAT FOX DOES! Yes, they have an agenda. Yes they are deceptive and manipulative. Try to get over it for more than one day and just ignore them. They aren't worth the effort.
0	2	This was begging for a "eh distorts facts and doesn't afraid of anything."

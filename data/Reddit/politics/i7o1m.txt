0	2	Obama has said a lot of things, and has unduly flaked on just about as . things.
1	8	The "same rights" would include marriage, and Obama has never supported that. It seems as if he is trying hard to appease both sides of the issue. Civil Union is progress, though. 
-	-	No baby steps, just the beginning of another election cycle.
0	1	And hell remove his statement in the following days just like he did on Palestine. Its a shame really that even the President cant say what he wants to 
0	1	Semantics with regard to politics is really starting to piss me off. I don't believe the government should be able to dictate whether or not homosexuals can be "married". Leave that to the church...that is their institution. If the end goal is civil unions, then we should stop even using the words "gay marriage".  Same with climate change. When you refer to it as "global warming" it lets the herp derps be all like: "Lol, if there was such a thing as global warming then why is it getting colder in the winter?"  "Climate change" at least implies: "Man the weather has been more fucked up than I can remember in my lifetime"
0	1	Vote for Ron Paul, he wouldn't fight gays getting married. 
-	-	Well he would, just not at the federal level. 
0	2	Telling gay people they can get a "civil union" but not a "marriage" is logically and morally equivalent to "separate but equal".  I wish I knew whether Obama was playing politics here, or if he actually believed this. The former would show moral cowardice, the latter moral dereliction.
1	8	i completely agree.
0	1	He would, however, support the "right" of states to ban gay sex.  LIBERTY!!1!!

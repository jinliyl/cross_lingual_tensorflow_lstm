0	2	They should raise the tax to 1.38 a gallon, I am sure then the roads would be fixed.
-	-	States are considering (Oregon already has? Might be Washington) putting surcharges on owners of hybrid cars to offset the tax they aren't paying on gas.
0	1	hell. why not $5 ? imagine how awesome the roads would be then !
0	5	I think that's an overly exaggerated statement. I consider myself somewhat liberal. I stay away from those labels, and I am constantly arguing on reddit that this country can thrive on lower taxes. I personally believe the current tax system amounts to a scam on the American people. I didn't vote for Obama, and before he was elected warned he would continue many Bush doctrines that Democrat supporters hated. I don't believe the state should be in the business of providing direct care for the people (social programs) but that the people should provide those for themselves.  But, I do believe in Bill of Rights and allowing people to live their lives the way they want. I believe in liberty, the root of liberalism. They way you use the term, it sounds like Democrats exercise liberalism, yet most don't because they submit and vote for legislation that limits individuals liberties, along with most Republicans. You need to stop listening to Hannity and the hippo-crit Rush Limball and realize that there are worthy Democrats out there, and that the bad ones are pushing for the same endgame as the bad Republicans.
-	-	TIL that I can help my state's budget problem by driving more miles in a less fuel-efficient car.
1	6	$.69 per gallon? Hah!
-	-	Why are the roads shitty?  1.) Freeze-thaw cycle in NY wreaks havoc on roads. Causing potholes, crack propagation and vehicular damage.   2.) Roads are *extremely* expensive. For example, installing a 4-way traffic signal at an intersection costs approximately $240,000. One spot in a parking garage can cost between $15- $20,000.  Could the costs of repairs and maintenance be brought down? Probably, other states can do it. But keep in mind everything that needs to get fixed, constructed or repaired. 
1	4	TYL that in Poland it's roughly 3,30$ per gallon and opening a new highway is a national-grade event. Be happy that you still keep your liberals in check
-	-	Well the state needs that money so that it can give tax cuts for the rich.
1	5	I feel for you bro. Here in Michigan I find a sense of relief crossing the border into Ohio. Where the roads don't rattle the shit out of my center console. Really the only thing for me to look forward passing into Ohio. Oh, and cedar point...

1	8	I work for the government, I am familiar with the gas tax. Roads are very expensive to maintain. There is also a lot of them.  The tax in your instance its 0.69 goes to a state fund, then gets distributed to local governments to improve the roads. So its a process based on how well traveled the road is, to get it repaved or repaired bases on the allotted funds that year to the respective government agency.  
-	-	I am too jaded to believe that. The extra revenue would lead the politicians they can endure more spending, thus, extending the budget problem.
1	4	haha 69.

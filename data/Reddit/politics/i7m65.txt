0	3	As a former USPS worker, I hope not. That is the most fucked up company/agency ever. The unions are so strong that they are strangling the company dry of revenue. You have people who intentionally walk slower so that they get more hours (time and a half after 8 hours, DOUBLE pay after 10). These people scream and yell at supervisors and get away with murder.  Many of the clerks work super slowly. One trick of the trade is to go to the doctor and have him put a lifting restriction on you. That way, you don't have to lift anything over that weight. Oh, and if a temporary employee makes more hours than a "regular" union employee, the union employee gets paid for the difference in time.

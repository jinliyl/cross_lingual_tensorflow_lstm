0	2	The important thing to remember here is that Republicans and conservatives are masters at the political game.  They know what they're doing is unpopular, but they manage to pass these inhumane, draconian, fiscally insane measures, then when election time rolls around, they jack up the batshit crazy propaganda machine, flood the airwaves with fear, hate, and lies, and minimize their losses.  Everyone needs to take an active roll in *recording* what they are doing, then using that information in the election cycle to debunk their propaganda and demonstrate without a doubt the extremist corporate agenda they are ramming down America's throat.

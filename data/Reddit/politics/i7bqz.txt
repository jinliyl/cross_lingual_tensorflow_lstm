0	2	&gt; JPI claims the private industry hasn’t merely responded to the nation’s incarceration woes, it has actively sought to create the market conditions (ie. more prisoners) necessary to expand its business.  Darn straight they would be doing that.  If you privatize prisons, you're effectively telling them that they are businesses now. And what's important to a business? Making as much profit as possible. And how do you go about doing that? Doing more with less, gaining new customers, or research and development for either of those two.  So long as there's a profit motive, privatized businesses are going to want more people in prison, not less, as it's the easiest fix for their bottom lines. As such, privatization schemes for things like this are downright absurd, as they encourage the sort of behavior in which you aren't wanting in the first place.

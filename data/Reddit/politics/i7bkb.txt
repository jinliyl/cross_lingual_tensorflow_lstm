0	2	Hilarious. The turd blossom certainly has a fine sense of the absurd. The counter-factual hits just roll in consecutively:      1. "...he faces serious threats." Really? Is that the threat from Bachmann or Gingrich or...? Please.     2. "The economy is very weak..." He knows this, because he and W made so certain of it during Bush's 8 years.      3. "He's defending unpopular policies." Again, who would know this better than the champion of those unpopular policies GWB instituted and Obama has continued?      4. "He's made bad strategic decisions." Mission accomplished? Greeted as liberators? Tora Bora?  One of Rove's major skill sets is attributing his team's own worst features to the opposing team and trying to make the other team somehow culpable. Watch for it. Every time.

1	6	The Intrade market still gives Obama a 57% chance of winning, pretty much a coin flip. There's money to be made if anyone really thinks they can predict better.

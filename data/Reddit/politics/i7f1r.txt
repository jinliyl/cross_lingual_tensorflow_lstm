0	2	Cutting the deficit in real fiscal terms means a desire to cut economic growth. I mentioned this in another thread but the basic explanation is as follows: economic growth per GDP means you have a concommitant fiscal expansion. In a fiat monetary system, this can come from three places (1) current accounts surplus (e.g. an external surplus), (2) public deficit, or (3) private deficit. The US runs a current accounts deficit (and it will continue to do so), so there must be a net deficit domestically to support growth. Since the private sector is attempting to run a surplus right now due to poor growth projections and the inherent risk on the microeconomic scale of deficit spending with low aggregate demand in the consumer sector, the magnitude of deficit the public sector runs will strongly correlate with expected growth.  I suspect most of the reason people believe cutting the deficit is an imperative is because they think about monetary economics in terms of when the US was on the gold standard and they tend to apply budgetary constraints and norms that roughly correspond to their personal finances. The problem with such reasoning is neither is applicable to a non-convertible fiat currency on a floating exchange rate. From the position of a sovereign issuer, such currencies are not a form of barter (e.g. they are not structurally interchangeable with real economic output) but rather a means of directing economic output. Thus, the real macroeconomic constraints on the federal government are the convergent effects of real capacity, demand for the currency, and aggregate demand which will largely determine the degree to which the government can direct economic output to public programs. Since the US is well below full utilization, this is not a realistic risk even in the face of spending on the order of a few % of GDP.
1	6	could they keep walking.. preferably into traffic?
-	-	Title Correction: Republicans walk out of Congress, saying they will not agree to any budget that does not reduce the size of government.  Meanwhile, Obama demands more time to play golf.

0	2	I don't understand how Republicans (whom we all know are racists) could be against an organization that was [founded on the principles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sanger#Eugenics_and_euthanasia) of reducing the black population.  Clearly, somebody is lying.
0	2	I was just about to post the same thing.  Seems like a lot of posts in /r/politics have been editorialized to make it bigger than it seems.  I believe if people have to over exaggerate it to make a point, then they probably didn't have a point to begin with.
1	8	See this is in itself a pretty important development, but it was killed by the misleading headline. The republicans declared tax increases off the table and appear ready to play chicken with going into default. THAT is important.  The editorializing that has no basis in the article wasn't important.
-	-	I was getting ready to post this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZoFLMTGCJ8. Just the first 14 seconds. 
-	-	... that's not at all what I said, and despite you resorting to name calling, I will respond.  Obama extended the tax cuts that Bush implemented as part of a deal that was brokered with congressional Republicans to allow for the extension of unemployment benefits. It was a compromise in that Obama and Democrats would have preferred *not* to extend tax cuts for the wealthy. So, I don't see how you can reasonably imply that we should somehow label these tax cuts as Obama's. The most appropriate labeling would be "Obama's Unemployment Benefits Extension" and "Congressional Republican's Tax Cuts."  A source in case you'd like to educate yourself: [http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Politics/paycheck-obama-tax-cut-extension-means/story?id=12423601](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Politics/paycheck-obama-tax-cut-extension-means/story?id=12423601). Make sure to read the whole thing, especially the bullet points discussing how Obama would have liked to only extend the cuts for those making less than 250k, etc.
1	4	You're making it sound like Obama didn't want to do it and he was only doing it as a compromise.  Yeah, I've heard a lot about what Obama "would like to do", but guess what? You don't look at that. If you did Obama would be the best President EVER. You look at what a President has *done* not what he claims to *have liked to done.* Only pandering idiots like you fall for that.  By your logic the Vietnam war is now the Kennedy War. Oh boy I love it when you can attribute a policy to the first president that implements rather than also the proceeding presidents that follow it.  Obama signed the tax cuts into law. He supported the bill that extended them, so they're his. It doesn't matter what he says (you seem the be the only person who still doesn't "get it"), it matters what he does. He extended the tax cuts. They're his. Bush didn't sign them, Bush didn't even voice support for the extension. You are tripping over yourself trying to convince yourself that because Obama didn't support in his heart what he signed into law it shouldn't be attributed to him, but somebody else who literally had nothing to do with the bill that was signed into law. It's hilarious and pitiful at the same time.
-	-	No, me neither, but I'm hoping there's a strategy in there somewhere - get the GOP to do stuff like this until it's obvious to EVERYBODY that they'd rather send America down the tubes than risk losing in 2012, then miraculously grow a spine.
1	8	No, he means the Bush Tax Cuts. Bush proposed them, pushed for them and got them passed. When Obama passed an extension it was a part of a compromise to allow for spending to help the economy recover. That's hardly enough to call them "Obama's Tax Cuts."
1	6	&gt;Reddiquette is just advice, not a binding rule.  &gt;Everytime mods do ban something like this, it inevitably leads to "OMG So and so censored me". Especially in /r/politics   So basically, you're too afraid to lose internet credit from your e-friends to moderate? What's the point of having moderation in the first place? This is why Reddit is a laughable place to find information.
1	4	yes we can!  herpderp
-	-	Must ... not ... feed ...
0	2	&gt; No, he means the Bush Tax Cuts. Bush proposed them, pushed for them and got them passed.  This is wrong. Those tax cuts expired. The current extension was pushed for and signed by Obama. They're Obama's tax cuts. He supported them actively and signed them into law. You can lie to yourself all you want, but it just makes you look like a pandering delusional idiot.  If you seriously believe Bush has anything to do with the tax cut extension GTO.
-	-	Just try to extrapolate that argument to anything else and you will see why it doesn't hold water. Say Subway had a month long three dollar special on their meatball subs. After that month was over the price would go back to five dollars (or whatever they charge). You wouldn't say they had risen prices on the sandwich, the prices just returned to their normal levels after the sale was over. Just so, the tax cuts are just a temporary special and eventually they will expire and return to the normal rate, ending them is not a tax hike just a return to the normal level. 
1	8	Really you're debating semantics at this point. The rich got a two year extension of their tax cuts that were set to expire. It's true to say that after 2012 their taxes paid would be higher than they are today, but it's also true to say that extending the benefits would be granting them a tax cut that they're not currently entitled to.
1	6	How do we keep them from getting back in?
0	2	Ironic that your user name is anti fox news, and yet you editorialize and lie about the news as much as they do.

1	4	"Representative Eric Cantor, the No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives, said participants had identified trillions of dollars in potential spending cuts but were deadlocked over tax increases sought by Democrats. Republican Senator Jon Kyl also pulled out, according to an aide."  They did not walk out of congress, only of the negotiations, unlike some Wisconsin Democrats who I sure you would argue were only doing the people's will.  Second, they did not walk out over lowering taxes for the "rich" or defunding planned parenthood. They walked out over Democratic insistence on raising taxes. Your headline is simply a lie, plain and simple.
0	1	fuck the GOP. let there be no budget then and see what happens.

1	6	"Breaking?"  That's a downvotin'.

-	-	Stop paying them till they go back, would be my way of fixing this.
0	5	Because Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy are scheduled to sunset, extending those cuts would be the same as providing a tax break. So insisting that the cuts be extended is the same as saying that "they will not agree to any budget bill that does not lower taxes for the rich".
-	-	CTRL+F Planned Parenthood. Huh, nothing there.
0	2	That Republicans will not under any circumstance entertain any tax increase proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that they are not serious about balancing the budget and reducing the deficit.  No solution will be found without spending cuts AND revenue increases.  Every day it becomes clearer that their main goal is to keep the deficits high and the economy in the toilet until the 2012 election - while acting like they want the opposite.
1	8	You're very defensive in your arguments. Do you think calling me a "pandering idiot" and proclaiming that I'm the only one that doesn't "get it" is productive towards getting me to see your opinion?  My guess is you just want to call people names online, so enjoy :)

0	2	Fanatical, whoring assholes, every one of them.
1	6	You mean the Obama tax cuts right? The Bush Tax Cuts expired. Obama signed the current tax cuts into law.
1	8	The oil and gas subsidies are not true subsidies. Rather, they are tax breaks for things like capital depletion to which every mining type industry which depletes its stock. "Big Oil" is simply easy to demonize. You can say you are ending tax breaks to Big Oil and simply not mention the fact that every corporation also gets those benefits. The domestic manufacturing deduction allows you to deduct 9% of your income for domestic manufacturing, growing, and extracting in the US. Every company is entitled to this deduction. The gas and oil industries are the only ones who can only deduct at 6% for no other reason than some politician wanted to look tough by "standing up to Big Oil." There is no subsidy or tax break that the oil and gas industries qualify for that is specific to them. They do not get special treatment under the tax code. Period.  Tax breaks that benefit wealthy individuals is also a rather misleading phrase. What it is referring to, more likely than not and we'll find out in a few days if I'm wrong, is not a reduction in only the upper personal income tax rates. They are talking about reducing certain types of taxes, like the taxes you would pay if you sold stock that increased in price, that are especially harmful to economic activity. All taxes marginally slow the economy to gain some extra revenue so transferring money from the tax payer to the government has some cost to society. Some taxes, like a flat sales tax, don't reduce the economy by that much for the amount of revenue they bring in. Some, like capital gains taxes, reduce the economy by a lot for the amount of revenue they bring in. By reducing those taxes, society does not pay as much for government

0	2	Right. The more sensationalized the title is, the less credible the story appears to be.  The title is the first impression in which people get about a particular story. If it stays calm, rational, and informative of the actual content, it helps to keep the discussion about the story to be calm, rational, and informative.  So, in a way, it important for helping to establish where the thread is going to go, since while many redditors are fairly decent with at least glancing over the content of an article before posting, they're still using the title as a way in which to get them engaged in the first place.  Besides, it's not really good reddiquette either.
0	5	I'm starting to feel like these vote counts are all rigged.  Would NOT surprise me anymore.
0	6	actually, zero of three.  The republicans didn't walk out of congress, they walked out of the budget talks.  They are two totally different things.    On a related issue, how does this thread make the first page?  Clearly, the thread title is total bullshit, so what conclusion do you draw?  Do you assume that the majority of the people on reddit are just too stupid to know what is really going on?  Or do you assume that they know the truth, but willingly upvote lies in order to attack their opponents?
-	-	FTA:  &gt; Representative Eric Cantor, the No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives, said participants had identified trillions of dollars in potential spending cuts but were deadlocked over tax increases sought by Democrats. Republican Senator Jon Kyl also pulled out, according to an aide.  Fascinating.  This time, the Republicans are actually vaguely the good guys.  There seems to be overwhelming dissent to any raising of the debt ceiling.  Which is fantastic, it should never be raised, there need to be immediate and drastic spending cuts.  As we all should know by now.  The article tries to call subsidies tax breaks:  &gt; In recent sessions, Democrats have pressed to close a wide range of tax breaks, from oil and gas subsidies to breaks that benefit wealthy individuals.  This is not true.  This is a sort of shell game that they're playing to distract people.  Subsidies are money that the government takes from the general fund and gives to specific companies.  It's not the government deciding NOT to take taxes to begin with.  But sadly, they are not talking about the most important thing.  1.4 trillion bucks annually to the military.  Out of 4 trillion total federal spending.  China, the #2 country in terms of military spending, spends 110 billion annually.    None of these programs need to exist.  That's what everyone in this country needs to understand.  None of them.  Not any part of the 4 trillion.  The debt does not have to be paid off, the debt is all just a carrot and string that drags Americans along into enslavement.  People who got paid for government work have already gotten paid, the debt is to international banker criminals.  That's why it keeps going up, it wasn't even in the trillions before 1975, now it's 14 trillion.  The government wants to just keep increasing taxes, keep increasing spending, it goes on and on and on, and there's only one way to consolidate the deficit - cutting spending.  Raising taxes ALWAYS makes the government spend more. ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS.  The higher the debt limit goes, the more they spend.  And this time it's arranged so that the Democrats want to raise taxes and increase spending, and the Republicans want to stop the debt ceiling increase and cut spending (the opposite of what it was 8 years ago, the opposite before then, before then, etc.), because ALL of the anti-government sentiment - THE PEOPLE YOU NEED TO BE SUPPORTING - is with the so-called "Tea Party," the people who, if anything at all is uniting them, want to CUT government spending.  So if the Republicans are pushing for spending cuts and refuse to raise the debt limit, GREAT.  The Democrats must compromise severely.  Military spending must go FIRST.  The national debt needs to be written off ENTIRELY.  Cutting military spending down to the level of ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD would eliminate almost the ENTIRE DEFICIT.  Cutting a few other unnecessary programs like, oh I don't know, the TSA, DHS, CIA, FBI, NSA, would eliminate the rest.  We don't even have to talk about the "regulatory" agencies yet.  No, the debt is not owed to China, before anyone says that.  Sure, Hu Jintao and some finance ministers or some scum like that will get a nice fat cut.  But all that money goes to the people who run politics here.  This whole submission is a joke.  More of this Republicans vs. Democrat bullshit.  Theater, theater, theater, theater, that's all we get these days.  But here it is.  The reason you read through this whole comment.  The one way to work within the government and destroy the national debt, without circumventing a single law in the process.  &gt; Federal Reserve Act  &gt; Section 31. Reservation of Right to Amend  &gt; 1. Reservation of Right to Amend  &gt; The right to amend, alter, or repeal this Act is hereby expressly reserved.  &gt; [Omitted from U.S. Code. Part of original Federal Reserve Act; not amended.]  http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section31.htm  Repeal the Federal Reserve Act.   The 14 trillion dollar national debt DISAPPEARS.
1	8	No it's not. It's tantamount to saying "They will not agree to any budget bill that sees taxes increase for the rich".  The rich already have the tax cuts thanks to the Bush tax breaks. If they aren't renewed it's a raise in taxes, if they are extended it's not new tax cuts it's maintaining the same level of taxes.

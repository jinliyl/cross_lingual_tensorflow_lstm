0	2	Hi from someone not from the US.  What you people think is left is considered far right by the rest us.  You people have 2 choices, far right (democrats) and the fuck if I can come up with name for republicans, right wing theocratic extremist seems far too mellow. Seriously, you guys need to get a passport and actually go and see what left and right politics actually looks like.

-	-	As we all know, the large, multi-national corporations that [own the media](http://www.cjr.org/resources/index.php) and earn their [revenue through advertising (paid by other corporations),](http://adage.com/datacenter/) have a vested interest in undermining the interests of corporations!  That's why when we turn on the TV or the Radio there is a constant stream of voices claiming that the media is too liberal.

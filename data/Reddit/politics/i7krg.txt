1	6	I recently posted this on my facebook not expecting much in terms of opposition, but one of my old high school friends made a surprising claim:  &gt; * half the population doesn't pay taxes  * the top 1 pct account for 40 pct of the taxes  * So because people who were smart and earned their insane wealth by playing smart, they should have to pick up the slack of the rest of the country   I responded to his comments with this article and by saying that being rich doesn't necessarily make one smart and being poor doesn't make one lazy...and a few other points. I am pretty set in my beliefs but if someone thinks that the rich need even more taxes breaks, please explain because it makes no sense to me whatsoever

0	2	 I totally agree with you! I hate the fact that the republicans refuse to even debate this issue.  Taking away the horrible policies of reaganomics and the Bush take cuts could really boost the economy.

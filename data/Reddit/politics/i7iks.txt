0	5	With Bernanke clueless about why doubling the deficit in 2 years hasn't improved the economy - can we finally put the Keynesian model to bed.   It is ridiculous to think deficit spending in the capitalist sector toward new technology versus deficit spending on temporary social programs and the back logs of too-big-too fail international businesses would result in the same outcome.  Most on the right already know this - but the left seems to believe they are too intelligent to realize. Spending on new technology results in marked IP advancement.  Spending on social programs, backlogs and shovel-ready projects means you are right back where you started.  We are at the least, on the worlds most expensive economic experiment with debt.

Really though the medical treatment costs for one case of huntingon's is probably equal to around 20-30 times the cost of this prenatal testing.  Not to mention the fact that you know a innocent human life is spared from a long and debilitating disease.
1	4	That is really good news. Usually people have to find out themselves before they can go for genetic testing, but living with that diagnosis is not always what people want. So to be able to have PGD done when in the at risk category is a big step forward.

1	8	Yup. Any diagnosis of illness is bad, but in my view Huntington's is just one of the worst, because it develops so much later, not only do you watch a parent go through it but know there is a strong possibility you will have to go through it too.  To be able to feel safe that your children won't have it or carry it is a great feeling.

1	4	Ohhh good website, thankyou.  Yeah with all the moral and ethical implications, and not knowing who will be affected, how early the disease will set it, knowing there is little can be done to ease the disease progression.  I did some assignments on it when I was in my first yr undergrad.

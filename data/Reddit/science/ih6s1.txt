-	-	The pro-AGW crowd had their own fun with that year a while back:  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/official-1998-is-the-hottest-for-a-thousand-years-1182191.html  "The research will add further credence to global warming being caused by industrial gases, such as carbon dioxide from vehicle exhausts and power station emissions."    
-	-	So in other words "take out all of the points that disprove our dogma", then you have a case.  I work at a National Lab; these simulations are a joke.  There's so much hand-waving going on there, it's not even funny.  Do you even have the slightest clue about UQ?  No wonder pro agw scientists say [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lindzen) is impossible to beat. 
0	1	dirt in the air, from burning all that coal, lands on ice, making it darker to absorb more sunlight
0	1	I'll take "Experts who don't know shit either way" for $1000, Alex.  WTF?  Pollution is bad, not polluting is bad...  ETA:  I worked on a software contract project for some EPA stuff one time.  I was astounded at how lousy most of their models were.  That they draw  conclusions from such crappy software boggles the mind.
-	-	Here's a [link to the actual paper](http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pnas-201102467.pdf). First sentence of the conclusion:   &gt; The finding that the recent hiatus in warming is driven largely by natural factors does not contradict the hypothesis: “most of the observed increase in global average temperature since the mid 20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations (14).”
-	-	You did not read all the posts affiliated with this submission It got over 2000 upvotes and was in the top 200 when it was removed. The discussions concerned climate change and bam it was gone. The positives for increased CO2 or warming are the big no no for reddit.  Moderators took complaints from those who object to a submission that does not show the sky is falling but instead shows a good thing happening, and removed the [submission.](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/i9b0b/sahara_may_be_ending_hundreds_of_years_of_drought/)
0	2	I'm not comfortable assuming corruption and malice where simple incompetence is a sufficient explanation.
-	-	Actually, that is a different Michael Mann than you are thinking. This is not *the* Michael Mann of Hockey Stick fame.  &gt;does not contradict the hypothesis: “most of the observed increase in global average temperature since the mid 20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthro-pogenic greenhouse gas concentrations   Indeed. Nor does it support it.
0	1	&gt; So in other words "take out all of the points that disprove our dogma", then you have a case.  You're projecting, because the situation is *exactly the opposite*.  The deniers who shout *no warming in the decade since 1998!* insist on excluding all data but the range 1998-2008.  Their conclusion is comically sensitive to the starting year, and is reversed if you start in a different year etc...  It falls apart completely when you use a full century of data.  Any analysis that's so sensitive to using one specific starting/ending year is simply bad.
1	4	That's accurate because it's part of a warming trend and that trend remains strong even if you ignore 1998 entirely.  The specific claim of "no (statistically-significant) warming since 1998" is rhetorical trickery about a statistical anomaly which obscures the actual facts.  The situations are not comparable. 
-	-	You set the tone for this discussion with a misleading and inaccurate headline for a story that inaccurately represents the original paper.
-	-	"'33% more carbon will have no effect.'"  who made that statement?
-	-	I am not the one making claims here. 
-	-	Are you sure you know why it was removed?
-	-	Grey's opposition: People like to be better off than others. Don't underestimate malice.
0	3	Are *you* a gigantic, evil lobbying group that pays millions to Reuters to get them to say what we want?  No?  Then *you're* wrong, you dirty little peasant.  Now thank me for clearing that up for you and keep fearing nuclear power.
-	-	Perhaps it's not perfectly understood, but that's inherent in science.  There's less uncertainty than your headline and comments would lead a person to believe.  From the conclusion of the paper you linked:  &gt; The finding that the recent hiatus in warming is driven largely by natural factors **does not contradict the hypothesis: “most of the observed increase in global average temperature since the mid 20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthro-pogenic greenhouse gas concentrations (14).”**  ETA:  I didn't use *denier* as an ad-hominem.  I don't know anything about you, three of the study's 4 authors (I'm familiar with Mann, who is not a global warming denier), or Wynn (the Reuters journalist).  It's an insult and a label, but not a use of the ad-hominem fallacy.
-	-	At least we know aerosols can be effective at cooling the planet. If it's too late to prevent global warming by cutting back we'll need to know how best to do it proactively.
-	-	This study doesn't contain the time curve of atmospheric sulphur concentration (sulphate the less) - although all extrapolations and deductions are based on it. It's all just a speculation from this perspective. The influence of sulphates to the global cooling is speculative too. Sulfate aerosols are believed to reflect sunlight back into space. The gamma rays are linked to global warming, because they're believed to form aerosols too. Surprisingly, in such case these aerosols are believed to contribute to the global warming. The graph in the study doesn't prove the contribution of sulphur emissions to the global cooling - on the contrary, it's itself based on this assumption.  Even the article name is tautological: you shouldn't correlate climate change with temperature change, because temperature itself is important aspect of climate - this is what the circular reasoning is called. And the rest of study continues in the same spirit.  http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pnas-201102467.pdf
-	-	"Natural cooling effects included a declining solar cycle after 2002, meaning the sun's output fell."  I've been saying that for a while.  Now that sunspots are finally starting to increase again it is going to get hot.
-	-	Hmm, so greenhouse gas emissions are "higher than ever" yet [global temperatures have dropped](http://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/03/08/3-of-4-global-metrics-show-nearly-flat-temperature-anomaly-in-the-last-decade/).   I thought the whole problem with greenhouse emissions were that *they led a rise in temperature* in the first place.  Which is it?
-	-	Premise: burning fossil fuels will damage the Earth.  If Earth warms it is because of fossil fuel.  If Earth cools it is because of fossil fuel.  If temperature is stable, it is because of fossil fuel.  Solution: Stop burning fossil fuel and everything will be fine.   Edit: Then the temperature will either increase, decrease, or remain stable.
-	-	I don't know what to think until Al Gore tells me.
-	-	This is what I usually assume happened, and that's why bad summaries don't belong in /r/science.
-	-	&gt; With 33% more carbon there should have been a greater increase than was detected.  Can you support that statement? 
-	-	not to mention that looking at surface temperature in general is completely missing the point.    The conversation can't progress until the average joe knows the difference between weather and climate...and articles like these don't really help.
-	-	more CO2 will stop global warming now?  really they change their science everyday
-	-	Aerosols, not CO2. 
-	-	Different gases act in different ways, and it's possible for them to counteract one another. The conclusion of the paper states "most of the observed increase in global average temperature since the mid 20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations."
0	1	This is a terrible headline and a terribly-organized story.  The Reuters article claims a "halt" in global warming 3 times and "cooling" 5 times despite the fact that those phenomena are nothing more than statistical noise.  It eventually does mention that the entire phenomenon is statistical noise (halfway through), but the purpose of this type of story is simply to catapult "halt in warming" and "cooling" as many times as possible.
-	-	Please cite Hadcru data...not the data of someone trying to make his 1988 predictions appear to be correct instead of absolute failures. A 1200 km projection of land temperatures over the Arctic ocean is hardly good science. Substituting land temps for Arctic temps 1200 km to the north is like saying Jacksonville Florida is the same temperature as Pittsburgh PA. Big difference.  We are still waiting for the 10 foot rise of sea level at Manhattan to put the West Side Highway under water as Jim Hansen predicted.  Try providing a graph with a little more detail. Go over to wood for trees and play with the data there.
-	-	If you look at [actual data](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/Fig.A2.gif), it's not so confusing.  1998 is a clear outlier, and that's the reason these denier pieces use 1998 as a sort of a baseline (it was unusually warm).  With the exception of 1998, every year from 2001-2008 was warmer than every prior year on record.  The pattern is obvious to anyone not paid to believe otherwise.
-	-	This is /r/science, not /r/sillyrhetoricsandhyperbole. 
-	-	Every time I see an article say "Various data show" or "A study finds", I have a conniption. This isn't hard science. Its speculation. 1998 was highly anomalous, and the total warming in farmlands, subarctic and polar regions has increased considerably since then. 
-	-	What do you mean "not warmed for more than a decade"? It's been a [pretty consistent rise](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/) for the last decade.  The problem seems to be that people confuse "noise" with signal. 1998 was certainly a high peak and there were years since then lower than that (and some higher), but these fluctuations still act around a [clearly increasing](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/Fig.A2.gif) trend, and January 2000 to December 2009 was [the warmest decade on record](http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/temp-analysis-2009.html).
0	1	Stop Global Warming! Burn more coal!
-	-	How does something like this end up in the science subreddit?  Whenever I go to submit an article to this subreddit I am met with a barrage of warnings saying that whatever I submit better damn well be scientific, or I should just head my ignorant ass on over to soft-science.  But then I see this?  So what gives with this subreddit?
-	-	&gt; Earth has not warmed for a decade  That's debatable.  [Here's some actual data.](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/Fig.A2.gif)  1998 is a clear outlier, and that's the reason these denier pieces use 1998 as a sort of a baseline (it was unusually warm).  With the exception of 1998, every year from 2001-2008 was warmer than every prior year on record.
-	-	eh? stopped warming?
0	1	what the *fuck*, global temperature patterns?!
0	1	There you have it, the solution to global warming:  BURN MORE COAL.
0	1	This article bends over backwards to be the quotiest of the quoted for anyone with an agenda.  It LITERALLY reverses it's own reported stance at least 3 times.  They helpfully linked absolutely no source references or papers leaving it up to the reader to do research from square one on...whatever they are trying to say.  Total  Fucking  Garbage  This is the kind of article that gets a legitimate downvote.
-	-	Ya thick gases released in the air is stopping global warming.  so ill just burn some rubber tires because thats helping, right?!?!?!
-	-	'Course, that's a little bit like blocking the painful effects of meth by taking more ;)  At some point you run out, and oddly enough the benefits stop immediately while the systemic problems are even bigger than before.
0	2	I never actually read those. They're even less damning than you make them out to be. The data didn't fit their specific model and one guy was dramatic about it and all the others disagreed. WORLDNEWS!
0	1	Only due to projecting temperatures northward for 1200 km. When a more reasonable 250 km projection is used the warmth drops .When actual ship and plane measurements are used the warmth drops again. Large portions of Africa where no stations exist were determined to have massive temperature increases. C'mon, quit the bullshit and post some graphs that do not hide the details in coarse linewidths and small resolution. [Again](http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:1997./to:2012/every:1)
-	-	You are right, it is quite debatable. But still, what is going on with climate, and why, is still unclear.  This just out yesterday from PMAS (warning, PDF):  http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pnas-201102467.pdf  (My apology for linking to Watts) :(  Edit: I agree with your post, but downvoted for the gratuitous ad hom, "denier."
-	-	At first I was told it was a duplicate.  Then I was told it was too old. Then I was told it did not matter that it was a popular submission. Then I was told It did not meet the criteria for the science subreddit.  Obviously they were dancing around the issue by giving one issue then admitting the first issue was not correct.
-	-	Ten years ago when the media was full of stories about "1998 was the hottest year of the millenium" it was pretty much rhetorical trickery about a statistical anomoly...
-	-	&gt; Actually, that is a different Michael Mann than you are thinking. This is not the Michael Mann of Hockey Stick fame.  You're correct, Michael **L.** Mann vs. Michael **E.** Mann.  &gt; Indeed. Nor does it support it.  Odd that you chose a headline so different from the conclusion of the actual paper.
0	1	Then I don't think you've been paying attention.
0	1	I dunno, can you support the statement: '33% more carbon will have no effect.'  carbondioxyde reflects well in the 'thermal' spectrum, ie inferred.  Each molicule you put up increases thermal reflection by a precise amount.  Total average sunlight reaching the ground ha gone down quite a lot in the last 6 decades, but the ability of the atmosphere to retain the heat has gone way up as each carbondioxide molicule added cannot help but be itself and reflect the heat back.  Thats the situation.  Take the 'polutants' out of our polution and this plannet will get a good deal warmer.  How fucked up is that?  We cant even just stop poluting with out wrecking the plannet, thats how far down this road we've already gone.
-	-	God forbid they give a link to the actual study? Anyone have that link?
1	4	Obviously. [](/jackieeeee!)
-	-	If the below commenters actually read the article, they'd realize that the smog and haze from burning coal is responsible for the reduction in sunlight and consequently the temperature depression. I don't know about other people, but I don't consider dying at the age of 40 from prolonged smoke inhalation the wisest method for preventing climate change.
-	-	There's something to be said for skipping the whole coal burning and pollution thing and just [injecting sulfur aerosols into the stratosphere to cool the planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_sulfur_aerosols). Some [scientists argue](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/09/060914182715.htm) that it could solve global warming on the cheap. 
-	-	I believe coal burning used to release sulfur which causes acid rain but reduced the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, thus keeping the temperature from continuing to steadily rise.   However, scrubbers were installed on most stacks to prevent the sulfur for being released in an attempt to stop acid rain and then the average temperature began to climb again...
-	-	ACID RAIIIIIN, some stay dry but other feel the pain
-	-	&gt;They're even less damning than you make them out to be.  You are putting words in my mouth.   The obvious point I was trying to get across  - climate scientists have recently expressed concern about being unable to explain the slowdown in warming in recent years.     
-	-	Why does this seem familiar ...  [Oh right.](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/igogt/global_warming_pause_is_linked_to_sulfur_in_china/)  I'll have to work on my titles.
-	-	So why are the caps melting?
-	-	I wouldn't call a researcher an expert. "Expert" implies they already know what there is to know. If they did, they would not be suggesting and researching alternative theories.
1	4	[Link to article](http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pnas-201102467.pdf)  Of note is the conclusion (emphasis mine):  &gt; The finding that the recent hiatus in warming is driven largely by natural factors does not contradict the hypothesis: “**most of the observed increase in global average temperature since the mid 20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations** (14).” As indicated in Fig. 1, anthropogenic activities that warm and cool the planet largely cancel after 1998, which allows natural variables to play a more significant role. The 1998-2008 hiatus is not the first period in the instrumental temperature record when the effects of anthropogenic changes in greenhouse gases and sulfur emissions on radiative forcing largely cancel. In-sample simulations indicate that temperature does not rise between the 1940’s and 1970’s because the cooling effects of sulfur emissions rise slightly faster than the warming effect of greenhouse gases. The post 1970 period of warming, which constitutes a significant portion of the increase in global surface temperature since the mid 20th century, is driven by efforts to reduce air pollution in general and acid deposition in particular, which cause sulfur emissions to decline while the concentration of greenhouse gases continues to rise (7).   &gt; The results of this analysis indicate that **observed temperature after 1998 is consistent with the current understanding** of the relationship among global surface temperature, internal variability, and radiative forcing, **which includes anthropogenic factors that have well known warming and cooling effects**. Both of these effects, along with changes in natural variables must be examined explicitly by efforts to understand climate change and devise policy that complies with the objective of Article 2 of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to stabilize “greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system.”
-	-	It's because people don't understand scale, or trends. Instead, they look at this:   http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:2001/to:2011/mean:60/plot/gistemp/from:2001/to:2011/mean:60  When they should be looking at this:   http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:1850/to:2011/mean:60/plot/gistemp/from:1850/to:2011/mean:60  
-	-	Compare your first chart to [this one.](http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2001/2001_Hansen_etal.pdf)  Hansen published in 2001 and the temperature anomaly was almost.7 degrees. NOW in the chart you link to it is around .55 degrees. This of course is in accordance with the practice of claiming that the present temperatures are the highest on record.  [Hansen lowers earlier temperatures](http://www.appinsys.com/GlobalWarming/Hansen_GlobalTemp.htm) to make it look like todays temperatures are the highest on record. He has done this for DECADES. It is dishonest and makes the NASA GISS temperatures out of step with [other temperature records.](http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:1997/to:2012/normalise/plot/rss/from:1997/to:2012/normalise)
0	1	I was going to give you the benefit of the doubt here, because I am skeptical by nature. You and I share nothing in common. You are either a paranoid fool or a cynical troll. That article suggests one positive effect of global climate change. By the way, I am sure there will be other pleasant changes. Alaska will likely have a longer growing season.  Guess what? That's not skepticism about the reality of climate change. Can you even fucking read?
0	2	In other words, that's not debatable, it's just wrong.
-	-	Because you are not supporting the **consensus**. If you were a global warming chicken little...anything you post warning about the end of the world gets upvoted and also a pass by the mods.  Try a little skepticism, and even a rip roaring post gets [removed.](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/07/090731-green-sahara.html)
-	-	I think the conundrum is why didn't the temperature increase much more.  With 33% more carbon there should have been a greater increase than was detected.  The global cooling effect of our pollution has been studied for quite a while, and is a phenomenon that has been countering the warming of the carbon dioxide.  The problem, as I understand it, is that the cooling particles will fall out of the atmosphere far faster than the excess carbon, and we'll be left with no counterweight.
-	-	The actual paper isn't bad, the Reuter's summary is bad (interprets and presents the paper and known facts badly), the Reuters headline is worse, and the Reddit headline turns it completely on its head.  The circle is complete.
0	1	Dude, to find the truth you have to look at the outliers. When someone is murdered, do you go talk to Joe Everybody, or do you talk to Snidely Whiplash? **QED**
-	-	No, [2004 and 2008 were both warmer than 1998](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/Fig.A2.gif).  So the underlying warming trend remains strong and remains important.  Particular claims about something being "most X of the decade/century/millennium" but are only a concern if the phrasing misrepresents a trend or obscures the real data.
-	-	 [Not True](http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:1997./to:2012/every:1) show a little detail.  1998 was cited as the bell weather for global warming. Although it is an outlier it is also the terminus of a rising trend and the genesis of a level trend. Had the oscillations not gone downward after 1998 and then up and down and up and down, about a linear plane from 1998 to 2012, there would be a point in the alarmist rhetoric. But it is level for 13 years from the 1998 point on the curve. Don't you think it odd that when 1998 peaked it was claimed there would be an exponential increase in temperatures? They guys projecting this were looking at the curve fit up through the highest peak. They did not count on the curve falling as it did.
0	1	&gt;What do you mean "not warmed for more than a decade"? It's been a  pretty consistent rise for the last decade.  From a somewhat-famous email exchange (truncated for readability):       &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You may be aware of this already. Paul Hudson, BBCs reporter on climate change, on Friday wrote that theres been no warming since 1998, and that pacific oscillations will force cooling for the next 20-30 years. It is not outrageously biased in presentation as are other skeptics views.    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\- *email to the late Dr. Stephen Schneider, October 11, 2009*    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As we enter an El Nino  year and as soon, as the sunspots get over their temporary--presumed--vacation worth a  few tenths of a Watt per meter squared reduced forcing, there will likely be another  dramatic upward spike like 1992-2000. I heard someone--Mike Schlesinger maybe??--was   willing to bet alot of money on it happening in next 5 years?? Meanwhile the past 10  years of global mean temperature trend stasis still saw what, 9 of the warmest in  reconstructed 1000 year record and Greenland and the sea ice of the North in big  retreat?? Some of you observational folks probably do need to straighten this out as my  student suggests below.    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\- *Stephen Schneider, October 12, 2009*    &gt;&gt;&gt;The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a  travesty that we can't.    &gt;&gt;&gt;\- *Kevin Trenberth, October 12, 2009*   &gt;&gt;At the risk of overload, here are some notes of mine on the  recent  lack of warming. I look at this in two ways. The first is to  look at  the difference between the observed and expected anthropogenic  trend relative to the pdf for unforced variability. The second  is to remove ENSO, volcanoes and TSI variations from the  observed data.  Both methods show that what we are seeing is not unusual. The  second  method leaves a significant warming over the past decade.  These sums complement Kevin's energy work.  &gt;&gt;Kevin says ... "The fact is that we can't account for the lack  of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't". I  do not  agree with this.    &gt;&gt;\- *Tom Wigley, October 14, 2009*    &gt;How come you do not agree with a statement that says we are no where close to knowing where    energy is going or whether clouds are changing to make the planet brighter.  We are not    close to balancing the energy budget.  The fact that we can not account for what is    happening in the climate system makes any consideration of geoengineering quite hopeless as    we will never be able to tell if it is successful or not!  It is a travesty!  &gt;\- *Kevin Trenberth, October 14, 2009*
-	-	&gt;The pattern is obvious to anyone not paid to believe otherwise.  Not so. There are many who are not paid to believe otherwise, yet do.  Many find GISS to be a poor indicator with some rather dodgy data manipulation having been done, and likely problems with siting, human observation error, and. improper extrapolation.  Argo and UAH tell a somewhat different story.
0	5	The global effect of pollution on our atmosphere is constantly studied by tons of scientists...  I don't know much about climatology, but just basic reasoning and a quick google would indicate that pretty stupid to think there should be a 1:1 correspondence between CO2 and temperature. First of all, I very much doubt the greenhouse effect is linear. Secondly, water vapor is by far the largest contributor to the greenhouse effect; CO2 is significant but only contributes 9–26%. Hopefully that's enough to help you see that you don't know enough to form hypotheses in this area.

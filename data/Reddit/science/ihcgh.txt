-	-	As always, here is what I like to believe is a lucid discussion of some of the topics covered in this piece:  First, let's look at the discussion of all 'computer chips'. In general, chips use moving charge (electrons) to perform work. There are two general types of energy 'consumption' in these chips: static and dynamic. Static refers to charge that is flowing at a relatively constant rate. this can happen on purpose, in the case of trying to create a stable voltage reference (used in many analog circuits) as well as undesirably in the leakage of transistors (the digital switches in these circuits).   Many analog applications use static power to create voltage references for things like amplifiers, comparators, voltage references (special kinds, such as temperature-independent), as well as things like oscillators and many others. For these purposes, we will not see spintronics take over very much. The problem typically is in the way we interface with the world from these chips (typically to other circuits). At some point, we go back to moving charge. Say you have an amplifier that powers a set of speakers - we use voltage and current to transmit the sound. We will likely never see spintronics take over a large amount of analog circuitry in many integrated components because it is simply incapable of replacing it.  For dynamic energy utilization, this is the best way to think of it. It takes moving charge to turn on and off the digital switches in the chips. There are billions of these on things like CPUs and memory devices. Each time you move that charge, you expend some energy. And what moves through the 'faucet' you switch on and off? Charge. And we have to use energy to move that charge! So here, if we can avoid expending as much as energy as we do now to turn switches on and off for logic circuits, we can save a lot of power total. For this, spintronics and other magnetic technologies come into play.  Spintronics, in general, is the idea that we can encode the state of a device in the spin of electrons (either up or down). This is very fast and requires very little energy. Why? You're not using energy to move multiple electrons - you're flipping the 'state' of an electron effectively. How do we actually do this though? A little bit of moving charge, typically. So it's not perfect, we aren't magically taking all of the energy out of this system.   So what is the real story here?  Only digital devices will really benefit from this technology. In particular, memory technology. Memory technologies based around charge is fading fast. The smallest unit we have is an electron. Flash memory puts a few electrons (8-100) on a polysilicon (sort of like glass) or metal sheet. DRAM stores memory state by distributing some electrons on a very, very small capacitor (imagine a cup that holds some electrons). As these sheets/cups shrink, we store fewer electrons. As a result, we struggle to determine if a device is holding a 1 or a 0. Magnetic technologies, like spintronics, offer a little bit of hope. We can potentially store a bit of memory in a very, very small space: a single electron. But there are some drawbacks. Flash memory can store more than one bit in a storage cell. Spintronics has yet to prove this possible (at least effectively). But the idea is that with spintronics we could create a very, very fast memory with a large density of memory bits and very low power consumption. I'll definitely settle for that. It has other problems, like how we package it (the little black 'chip' thing you see on circuit boards is usually either plastic or ceramic, and neither would do a good job of protecting spintronics-based RAM).  So, for logic circuits, spintronics may work out. Not nearly as easily as this email suggest, of course, and it certainly would be very low power and potentially very fast. But we are nowhere close to actually building spintronic logic circuits. **We can't do it yet.**  But for memory technology, we're already doing it. We're building spintronic memories (Spin Torque Transfer memory) - not to be confused with MRAM. It's still an R&amp;D effort, but relative to logic devices using spintronics, it is far ahead. It's fast and low-power, but it's not very dense or reliable yet - but those are the two biggest challenges in a memory technology. 
-	-	I suppose that degaussing your CPU and your memory constitutes rebooting?
-	-	..and ultimately one arrives at spintronics. it is a good test bed but the goal should be trapped spin states.
0	2	Oh please, not again.  The thing with magnetic spintronics is that it only is more efficient the smaller it gets (magnetic coupling only kicks to high efficiencies at small scales).  Right now the dimensions of general electronics are not exactly there yet.  That's nanoelectronics territory - coming but not there yet.  But also the technology is not there yet.  Right now spintronics gets used in disk-drive head (the reader) but that's very different from planar, photolithographic Moore's Law following scalability.  But for microprocessors, logic, etc. it's still at least 20 years out IMO.    Spintronics for that kind of application is sort of where germanium or silicon were in the 1930s in terms of semiconductor technology - obviously could work and work well but definitely not ready and significantly no money available to work it (just like during the Great Depression - many of the ideas imagined in the 1930s regarding semiconductors didn't have the capital funding to be made a reality until the 1950s after WWII).

-	-	However, MRAM **is being shipped today** (well for the last 5-6 years) and while not STT it is GMR/TMR based.  I agree, memory is the first niche if there is ever one at all.
1	4	A good joke, but definitely not. It could potentially wipe states or pseudo-randomize them, but it would not 'reboot'. A large portion of how a computer (more specifically, an integrated circuit) reboots has to do with moving charges. Basically, a combination of a resistor and a capacitor put between the power and ground rails give a slowly rising voltage. This voltage is then set as the input to a switchable device (like an inverter in CMOS technology). This allows one to create a logic signal (which can then generate a pulse) that says, "Hey! This circuit is powering up!" The device can then sequence power-up actions after this point. The general idea is called **power-on-reset**.   So, you may flip some bits, but you probably wouldn't reboot in the manner you expect.
0	1	However, MRAM **isn't any good**.

-	-	Because we were on the ark during the Flood.
0	2	We killed them all off, literally. Also it has now been proven that some people DO HAVE direct links to neanderthals, meaning that some groups of people interbred with them at one point. The study was peer reviewed and is now accepted as fact. Don't have energy to Google for the link.
-	-	I'm not convinced there is only one human species. You could make a case that black, white and asian people are more distinct from one another than many different species of animals are.  The idea that different species cannot interbreed to give fertile hybrids is false, by the way. Darwin's original Finches, which gave him the whole idea of speciation in the first place [can interbreed](http://carolinabirds.org/Trips/Galapagos_birds2.htm). Fundamentally the notion of "species" is fuzzy round the edges. All individuals are genetically distinct from one another, so there's no clear cut answer to where you draw a line around some individuals and call them a species.   But if aliens were to come to Earth and see the different varieties of humans the same way we see birds, they could reasonably say we come in quite a few different species.
-	-	I'm pretty sure that there are two different species of human currently on the planet.
-	-	I think we killed the other ones. 
-	-	Because it is human nature to murder those bastards on the other side of the valley because they are not in your family. Them and their slight differences can go to hell. What we call civilization is simply the steady march of reason over this natural way of things.
-	-	I have heard that european homo sapiens bred with neaderthals, we have neaderthal genes.  Not sure how true / to what extent this is.
0	1	Obviously we killed them...anything bad that happens in nature has to be our fault.  It couldn't possibly have been environmental pressures, disease or natural disasters that caused their demise.  How about this?  Thank you human ancestors for not going extinct so that we can have this discussion about how terrible you were for doing what you had to do to survive.
-	-	Well, without doing any research what so ever I'm going to guess: because we killed them all.
-	-	Because we're champs. Why else? B-)
1	6	Lol we fight with our own species even now... we killed the other ones a looooooong time ago.
1	6	I'm sure I saw evidence of one of the extinct species in my gym the other day.
-	-	Humanity is a species.  If there were other species, they wouldn't be humans.  There are plenty of species of Apes - humans are just one of them.
-	-	Or they could be the [Morioris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriori_people)
-	-	True -- there is no way the Australian abo is the same species as myself.
1	6	...Francis Galton, is that you?
-	-	Killed and interbred with.  All populations of European descent at least share *Homo sapiens neandertalensis* genes. :)
-	-	Maybe in another million years.  Right now humans have one of the least diverse intra-species genomes on the planet.  For all the different phenotypes you see, our genotypes are *remarkably* similar.  It has been said that if you pick any two humans on the planet, their genome is more probably more similar than two chimpanzees in the same troupe.
-	-	Personalities =/= speciation...
0	2	OP means alive today. There used to be a lot more but it looks like we killed them. I guess mean species don't have a lot of relatives... Although that doesn't hold true for the only other species that makes war, there are thousands of kinds of ants. That's comparing apples to organges though, or rather, assholes to insets.
-	-	[DONE!](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/i46hr/will_homo_sapiens_ever_diverge_into_2_separate/)
1	8	And to preÃ«mpt the most obvious reply, I realize this statement carries a lot of ideological baggage which I completely reject. I don't support any racist claims about some groups of people being more human than others, or any need to keep some groups "pure". No matter how you define humanity, we're extraordinarily diverse, with a fascinating and evolving history.
0	1	Why would that be something bad? We are the war monkey, we won! Fuck yea! Revel in your ability to mechanize death.
1	6	sure that it wasn't who was more homo?
-	-	&gt;  I expect, when all humans have brown eyes, brown or black hair, and skin the color of creamed coffee.  This statement is incorrect. Whatever "human territorialism and violence" occurs is irrelevant. If two people with black/white ancestry procreate, there is a chance they will have a blonde blue eyed kid since the alleles persist from generation to generation.  If breeding populations remain totally separate and races exist in the current or in a more pronounced form, then your statement is still incorrect since you have no basis for the claim that a certain phenotype will dominate.
-	-	That's based on an estimate of genetic diversity that has since been proven to be grossly understating the case.
0	2	indeed, you may be an ape, but you're not human
-	-	"Species" has a very specific term when we are talking science.  It specifically means that two individuals can produce viable/fertile offspring reliably. Said individuals are thus part of the same species.  The most you could make is an argument for different ethnicities as "subspecies"  Even that is laughable however. The humans species has less actual genetic variation between each other than almost any other species.  The idea that there is some significant genetic difference between ethnicity that even begins to approach *speciation* simply has no factual basis.  Especially if you do it based on skin color. There is more genetic diversity between east and west african for example, than between caucasian and either.  edit: grr.multipost.
-	-	Its not so much personality as it is natural tendencies to value certain things over other things.
0	2	Recently there are bots that copy a comment from elsewhere on the page and add an Amazon affiliate link. You should report such spam comments.
0	1	Actually, we both killed and fucked.  There's neandertal genes in us.
-	-	from your article: &gt;A number of historians, anthropologists and ethnologists however, examined and rejected the hypothesis of a racially distinct pre-Maori Moriori people. Among them, anthropologist H.D. Skinner in 1923,[20] ethnologist Roger Duff in the 1940s,[21] and historian and ethnographer Arthur Thomson in 1959,[22] as did Michael King's Moriori: A People Rediscovered in 2000 and James Belich[23] and K.R. Howe in Te Ara.[21]  
-	-	It give two potential examples of what you said, no?
0	2	Ask Magneto
0	1	Because we won the game at this stage by either killing or fucking every variant strain.  Just like we've always done.  This article will happen again in whatever media exists in a thousand years, I expect, when all humans have brown eyes, brown or black hair, and skin the color of creamed coffee.
1	6	... wait, you mean they're two *separate* activities?  OHSHI--
-	-	Well yes, in the same way an infant could fight Muhammed Ali.
1	4	exactly
-	-	Even waiving that definition, its still not sufficient to support the argument of speciation in humanity.  Take your own example: it postulates for the sake of argument conflating *h.erectus and h.sapiens* based on close similarity.
-	-	Actually, the abolition of speciation events will increase genetic diversity of the population.  Regression towards the mean only means that there won't be splits. It doesn't mean that there won't be increased genetic diversity.
0	1	Eat, fuck, kill, all the same.
0	1	There were many more before we spread out.  Homo neanderthalensis, Homo floriensis (died out 10kya), Homo erectus, [The new unnamed species I believe now called devisonians](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100324/full/464472a.html) and one more I can't remember.  FUCK YEAH, WE"RE GOOD AT KILLING SPECIES
-	-	Neanderthals were, according to most current definitions, also Homo *sapiens*.  Homo *sapiens sapiens* vs. Homo *sapiens neanderthalensis*.
-	-	Personally I think there are a number of subdivisions of the human species. It makes sense if you think about the type of people you don't ever associate with (ie., stupid meathead types). Smart sensible and kind people are a different subdivision.
-	-	I'm pretty sure that there are two different species of human currently on the planet.
-	-	seperate subspecies though   caucazoid  negroid  mongoloid   might be a few more 
-	-	[Relevant](http://discovermagazine.com/2009/nov/30-did-we-mate-with-neanderthals-or-murder-them/?searchterm=human%20neander).
-	-	Well sure.. its not like we would have eaten them or anything ... :)	
1	6	Particularly another species that occupied our same niche.
-	-	Throughout the Polynesian Islands, from Hawaii to New Zealand, there are legends about little people who could do great feats of labor working together.  In Hawaii they were called *Menehune*.  In New Zealand there were a race of people called the *Patu-paiarehe* before the arrival of the Maori on four canoes [Maori genealogy can trace back to which canoe one's ancestor arrived  on].  Then again, it could all be a myth, like the pixies (maybe not a myth); but the discovery of "[little people](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/little-people-flores.html)" on the island of Flores a few years ago gets one thinking...maybe the legends are true...
1	6	I think the Indonesians assimilated the "little people" on Flores, in the same way we assimilated the Neanderthals.  Either that, or it's pure coincidence that Indonesians are the shortest people on the planet: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_height#Average_height_around_the_world
-	-	Hawaii here... Menehune are definitely a myth. Also people have only been here &gt;2k years :)
0	1	How on earth is that a reply to what I said?
-	-	That might not be the case actually. There is a theory saying we basically integrated them by interbreeding. See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal_admixture_theory).
0	2	wat?
0	2	You never had Neanderthal soup? Bummer.
-	-	&gt;&gt;Homo sapiens sapiens vs. Homo sapiens neanderthalensis  so right away we probably started killing each other over who was more sapien than whom.
-	-	&gt; Neanderthals were, according to most current definitions, also Homo sapiens.  Actually, I think that's fallen out of favor very recently due to [improved radiocarbon-dating](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/10/science/10neanderthal.html).   Yes, there were some crosses to get the genes in, but those happened much further back when the two groups were still able to interbreed.
0	1	They likely died on their own.  The most important thing we relative to the others was...survive.  Hell, even now we're nothing compared to nature.  There's a misconception that the rate of extinctions are unusually high.  Yeah, its a touch higher, but every glacial period kills a significant percentage of the the species and puts our trivial extinction rate increase to shame.
-	-	There IS something different about him.
-	-	We have only been "alone" on earth for about 30000 years.  Before then we "shared" (probably very little actual sharing) the planet with Neanderthals.  A couple hundred thousand years before that we shared it with yet another species.  There may have been other species/subspecies within that time frame too...we just haven't discovered them.  The closest things left are the other great apes (yes, I included us in there because we are)
1	6	"Our ancestors, by contrast, created smaller, more sophisticated weapons, like a spear, which can be thrown, with obvious advantages when it comes to hunting and to fighting."  Interesting, we come from a long line of weapons builders.  What was once a survival advantage, may turn into a survival disadvantage.
1	6	So like...man....if we went into space...speciation would occur with those who reproduced in isolation and we would get super humans specialized to deal with space?
0	1	*Whatever "human territorialism and violence" occurs is irrelevant.*  I can tell right away that you're not a scientist.
0	1	Maybe it was the Indonesian doing the fucking, eh?
-	-	Which is why there will be *fewer* speciation events.  Speciation only occurs with reproductive isolation.  See: Reversion To The Mean.
-	-	That's an [outdated definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species#Biologists.27_working_definition) of species. Many delimited species can interbreed to give fertile offspring. For modern taxonomy, any separately evolving lineage with a single, relatively isolated gene pool [qualifies as a species](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html). Human ethnicities would certainly qualify, if we were being consistent with vertebrate taxonomy. 
-	-	Point of order: Speciation events *require* reproductive isolation of populations to occur.  Otherwise the mathematical principle of [Regression toward the mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean) prevents them.  Mass transit has anti-evolutionary properties.
-	-	So personal preference... Or simply one manifestation of personality.  A meathead is just as likely to have an introverted kid as anyone else. For this very reason, it is nonsense to call personality types "subspecies" as there is no hereditary categorization you can wrap around a population that is coherent and distinct.  Race is not even enough to assign "subspecies" to as even with the visual differences, the DNA is simply way too close in composition. If anything, it makes more sense to divide humanity between the population with the ability to digest lactose in milk and those who can't.  The Aborigines of Australia were a separate isolated population for 40 thousand years and still were human and not different enough to define as a subspecies.  This varies from species to species, but it would most likely take hundreds of thousands of years before speciation actually occurs.
-	-	I actually read an article in my anthro class in college that suggested there was more variation between individuals in an ethnic population than there were between ethnic populations as a whole.
1	4	We're pretty good at both of those activities...
1	4	Yeah, was probably the fairies then.
1	6	This is so weird. There are many kinds of monkeys and apes, but we are the only ape walking on two legs that is left, how did that happen and why? Because, the other human species was definitely more fit to survive than an ape, what in the world have happened that have killed them all? I like the thought of that there might be some left, inside the deep jungle, we still discover new isolated tribes of homo sapiens, what would hinder a neanderthal from living and thriving in the jungle, provided basic skills? One day we might make a sensational discovery, that would be cool!
1	4	I love how the "FIND OUT MORE" pictures shows a bunch of black dudes hunting. They're clearly human actors of today, ARE WE SUPPOSED TO ASSOCIATE THEM WITH PRIMITIVE PRE-HUMANS?
-	-	This is probably a better question for [/r/askscience](http://askscience.reddit.com).
-	-	Think of the definition of "species," also the idea of "human."
0	1	We ate the rest.
1	6	What about the ["hobbits"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_floresiensis) they found a few years ago?
-	-	&gt; These humans, Homo floresiensis, also known as "Hobbits", survived until around 12,000 years ago. And then they went, leaving us as the last human species on the planet.  Wow. I didn't realize the last non-homo-sapien homonids died out so recently...in fact, in only 2x the age of the world according to young-earth creationists. Really works to put into perspective the blink-of-an-eye that we've been here.  &gt;"If that gap were populated by other hominids, we'd see that gap as not so much a gulf but rather a continuum with steps on the way. We'd still think of ourselves as special, but maybe not so special - a little dose of humility wouldn't hurt.  What a fitting sentiment.  
-	-	The other ones live under the ice caps in ice cities and are ice giants...Odin missed a couple of them, and they are only waiting....  /s
-	-	Homo ergaster = homo erectus.
0	5	Mother Nature says there can only be one type of human species.
1	6	Are we going to take pictures of "Primitive pre-humans"?
-	-	Well no, they are H. Sapiens Sapiens. It's a quiz to test you.
-	-	&gt; when all humans have brown eyes, brown or black hair, and skin the color of creamed coffee.  This assumes a technological civilization (capable of world travel or producing vitamin supplements). Humans lost their pigmentation after leaving Africa because it was advantageous to have less pigmentation in those regions.   A world skin-pigmentation map of indigenous peoples pretty closely matches UV radiation exposure. Absent a world civilization, I'd expect skin pigmentation to revert to those distributions.
1	6	I think the subject is other species of comparable intelligence while being genetically incompatible with humans. Nothing like that exists despite what dolphin loving hippies might tell you.
-	-	This is most certainly incorrect.  The basics of genetics prevents the entire population from becoming homogenous. There will always be a certain amount of black and white people. There will also always be a certain amount of redheads and blue-eyed people.  See allele segregation.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance
0	1	If the last million years of evolution hasn't resulted in creamed coffee, why do you think the next 1000 will?
0	1	Yay! I want to eat you!
-	-	Humans have been building weapons for 2 million years: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-axe  In fact, our very first tool was a killing device. Think about that for a second. We've been building and using weapons for far longer than we have actually existed as a species. In fact, it's pretty widely accepted that our hand and arm structure evolved specifically for handling and throwing knives, spears, and clubs.
-	-	&gt; other great apes (yes, I included us in there because we are)  Great apes are as human as humans are great apes. Think of it - we had a last common ancestor. Which is the canonical branch? Neither. 
1	8	Too much iron in their blood.
-	-	No particular reason, they all went exstinct, some fairly recently too. There very well could have been two species of advanced hominids, but there isn't. No conspiracy or anything.
1	4	Because we won the competition...enjoy your place at the top ;)
-	-	There can only be one...
-	-	??
-	-	airplanes and internet
-	-	Difficulty of travel in the past allowed for humanity to divide into the various regional races. Modern ease of travel leads to inter-racial breeding, which if the curve continues the way it has been going, should eventually result in all of humanity being what would today be considered a mix of all current races.
-	-	Because of the introduction of mass transit in the last century, and the introduction of borderless nations by way of the internet in this century.  Give it ten more centuries.
0	1	It took a lot more effort for a European to find and fuck an Indonesian 1000 years ago.
0	2	You didn't take into account human territorialism and violence.  I'm not just talking about reproduction here; see my original comment.
-	-	Actually, it can't be proven that the first stone tools were used as hunting/killing implements.    It's more likely that the tools were used to scavenge corpses left by other predators (removing meat from bones, breaking them open to extract the marrow). 
-	-	There IS something different about them.
0	1	I don't know about reveling in the human ability to mechanize death, but just because some species goes extinct, doesn't mean we had anything to do with it.
-	-	&gt; because it was advantageous to have less pigmentation  Technically, it was because there was selection against pigmented skin. As of right now, there is no selection against pigmented skin in such areas. In fact, immigrants often are more fertile, so it may even be in the opposite direction.

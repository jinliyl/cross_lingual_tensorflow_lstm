0	2	Of course Top Gear doesn't actually think that. Hence "disingenuous". The problem is when people cite this comparison as though it makes any sense at all in practical terms. Then, suddenly, a humorous take on measuring car performance numbers becomes really not funny at all.
-	-	"But good as they are, lithium batteries are not up to the demanding task of powering the next generation of electric vehicles. They just don't have enough juice or the ability to release it quickly over and over again."  B.S.!  B.S.!  B.S.!  LiFePO4 cells (such as from A123) have been powering EVs for at least 6 years, for long distances, and with little degradation. I know: I have designed them, my company built them, and they are still running.
0	2	Only a fool would predict the future so optimistically.
-	-	Actually, the technicality is that it's NOT a zero-emissions car because it's emitting something (h20)
-	-	Yeah, I can agree with that. But I do think that those who drive long trips (and especially the slice of the consumer market who will demand the capability, whether they really need it or not) will occupy far more than 5% of car buyers.
0	1	Why do we want cars to not run on petrol? Unless we have enough clean electricity to power 95% of people's vehicles its kind of moot. You're just moving that pollution out of town to a coal plant somewhere. Plus power plants are generally only around 30% thermal efficient, then you have transmission line losses, then you have battery charger losses then at the very end you have the actually efficiency of the battery. Not to mention the coal mining process.  On the other hand you could pump fuel out of the ground, refine it, and then put it on trucks and then into your vehicle which can very easily be at 30% efficiency. Not saying this is better, but I don't think it can be that much worse.
1	4	I find myself more optimistic about the electric vehicle's prospects. I think if we can improve battery life enough to drive ~250 miles, plus create a "refueling" scenario that takes under 15 minutes, then we have a winner. I have strong hopes that, in our lifetimes, gasoline and diesel powered vehicles will be relegated to collector status only.  Aircraft, on the other hand, are so sensitive to weight that battery technology (as we understand it) may never really apply.
-	-	Yes they did, but Top Gear also made a nonsense point. For example, would driving a Nissan Leaf the way they drive an M3 really mean that "what you drive doesn't matter"?  I doubt it, since even a ragged-on electric vehicle will be worlds better than a babied M3, in terms of fuel economy.  I actually heard a serious person recently comment that "it doesn't matter what you car fuel efficiency is if you just drive in the city. All cars have about the same city mileage."
-	-	FCVs are non-starters because they are still electric cars, but with essentially very inefficient batteries.  If you're going to make an EV, do it the most efficient way possible.  That's a battery EV. 
-	-	What if they license their designs to someone with the manufacturing capacity?  Or buy up a few complete GM factories cheap at the next bankruptcy sale?
0	2	I don't care about those folks, I want something for me, and the average driver.   &gt; http://www.teslamotors.com/models/specs. 300 miles available in 2012. You're welcome.  Was in response to "a typical gas car" not a high end performance car. 
-	-	The Model S is a sedan, we're not talking about the Roadster. 
-	-	Ever.  The cost is raw materials, not in the difficulty of manufacture (it's not hard to order a container full of laptop batteries from China).
-	-	The model s coming out next year is a family sedan.
1	4	&gt;Sure the cars themselves will become zero emission units, however, the coal burning power plant producing the electricity will be belching nasty emissions at unprecedented rates  The problem with this tiresome argument is that it looks at "upstream" emissions of electric cars, but not at upstream emissions of gasoline.  The amount of energy (largely electricity) it takes to refine one gallon of gasoline could move an EV about 30 miles.   Also the energy used to truck gasoline to thousands of service stations handily exceeds the equivalent for EVs - charging via wire (90 to 95% efficient.)  So you're essentially driving an EV already - you're just burning lots of gasoline at the same time.  Oh, and all those old coal plants are baseload (coal plants adjust too slowly to follow power demand.)  Baseload means they already run at full output all the time.  So unless we build more of them, plugging in EVs doesn't change coal pollution.    It sure does change petroleum pollution, though.  
-	-	Sure, but how long before they cut their prices by 50%? I'm guessing 5-7 years would be overly optimistic. Tesla isn't going to be a GM unless they rework everything.  They're still filing drive gears by hand. You can't produce at high volume like that.  I hope they do it, but it's not something I'm expecting to driver, pretty much ever.  If gas gets to $7/USgal more folks will buy Prius style hybrids, and tow the line awhile longer.  We won't see an electric majority for at least a decade if not two. 
0	2	Please don't quote the "Top Gear" argument against electric cars because it is exceptionally narrowminded and foolish.  For example, moving all the pollution to one site is a better thing. We can control/filter and/or capture the pollution at one site, and future advancements may be able to help reduce the pollution at one site. It would be inefficient, expensive and harder to get everyone with a gas car to fit new filters on to do a similar capture/filter job.  Or consider a future where nuclear fission and renewables are in abundance. Cars still burning gas? Still polluting, but cars on electric? Nothing ever changed for them and the energy is cleaner and safer to produce.  You are building for the future, not today. The future that if 2, 5 or 10 years away when these cars will still be running. In 2, 5 or 10 years, our countries could be running so much more power plants on renewable or nuclear power. Then the payoff of electric cars really kicks in.
-	-	Same effect happened for the hydrogen fuel cell car.  The car technically becomes zero emission because its only exhaust is H2O.  Unfortunately, producing H2 from natural gas or other hydrocarbons, in the end, produces just as much or more pollution.   H2 just doesn't fall off trees.  This has finally become evident to the US politicians, and/or the scientists that had been touting that technology have been overruled by other scientists not financially invested in the technology, and the US has reduced H2 tech funding.
-	-	I'm sure 'treehugger.com' is a completely unbiased source...  On the subject anyhoo: Well, then get a Volkswagon Polo BlueMotion Diesel. It *is* more efficient than a Prius, and does less damage to the environment with the lack of battery production.  The Prius is a fashion statement by greenies who want to say 'Yes. I am driving a car that looks like shit, because I want to be seen to be caring for the environment'.   The key to the top gear piece was what they said immediately after the film ended: It isn't what you drive, it's how you drive it.  If you're doing 300 miles in a day, the Prius is unlikely to be a solid choice, as its efficiency is gained in cities. On the highway, its lack of performance over about 60 is a handicap, and watch the mileage drop if you breach that. A better choice for highway driving would be a Golf or Jetta Diesel, or even an A3 station wagon.
1	4	If you had even read what was already written in this thread, you'd notice I already hit that point.    Edit: If the M3 was leading, it probably would have lapped the Prius. More than once.
-	-	Maybe english isnot his native language.
-	-	Wow Reddit has truly changed.  This would have never been downvotedd before.
0	5	sorry, bad habit on my part. Thanks to a primary language that do not use ', the difference between the two slip by me.
0	2	I don't think it's legal in the US. After all sulphur is deamon related.
-	-	http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette &gt;Please don't:   &gt;Correct others' grammar and spelling. It doesn't add to the conversation. Also, correcting one's grammar or spelling is not a valid manner of refuting one's point. 
-	-	Stick with it soldier; downvotes are a small price to pay for letting someone know they're wrong.
-	-	You're right that there are significant moral hazards involved with not owning the batteries in your car, but it's not clear whether the cost due to the increased wear-and-tear will be more than the swappability benefit.  For instance, swappable propane tanks are widely used for grills with little issue.    One way to mitigate the problem would be to make the batteries as self-contained as possible, and have the driver keep a deposit on file which he loses if he breaks the battery.  Also, consider the fact that with a good swapping system, it might take just *seconds* to recharge your car, as opposed to a few minutes to fill a gas tank.  If it's automated, you might not even need to get out of your vehicle!
1	4	Interesting. I did not realise they were that far along. Have this kind of system also would be good for the environment as all the battery packs are managed by a third party they won't just end up in land fills when used up. 
-	-	I'm pretty sure reddit has a prototype of a hope-crushing comment already.
-	-	No. If you're driving a chevy volt, you'd just refill it at the gas station. 
0	1	Well that's shitty. Even if you walled the battery compartment off thick and bought your passengers at least a few minutes to get out of the car, every car accident would almost invariably leading to cars getting totaled via battery fire, multi-car pileups could turn into local incidents fairly easily, roads would be damaged...compounding this is the fact that Li fires produce LiOH, NaOH, and KOH as a by-product of the reaction, all of which are highly caustic materials and are quite literally sprayed a few feet around the fire violently.  Really it seems that the only way we're going to get lithium-battery cars is if we all start spending A LOT of money on copper metal extinguishers.
0	3	Die in a battery fire, you fear-mongering ass.
-	-	&lt;3
-	-	It's been in this "prototype" stage for more than a decade, iirc.  Some people make a compelling argument that it's an investment scam, or at least in dire financial straits.  See [the wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moller_M400_Skycar).
-	-	I would do this, were it not for the local droopy-trousered thugs who would cut it out of pure spite.
1	4	I smell a business opportunity
-	-	Standardizing batteries could limit innovation. The field is still so young and the tech is very new. Standardizing is for when things get settled. Like USB charging for phones.
-	-	Not really, no. I don't expect to see battery powered jets any time soon
1	4	&gt; Yes, but isn't the idea behind battery advances to get everybody off of petrol?  If the threshold for acceptance is "everyone", then we're going to have to wait a while.  I'm quite happy with every advance getting **more** people off of petrol.  
-	-	And hence, higher carbon content per gallon.
1	4	I'd be more than happy with a pure-electric with a range of ~100 miles.  I'd simply keep my 12-year-old, dirt-cheap-to-insure Jeep Cherokee around for the few times a year I need it, and use the electric as an in town runabout for the 95% of my needs it meets.
-	-	They're actually made up of many smaller cells, like these:  http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00QvbapkgJgioW/Li-ion-18650-Battery.jpg  6,831 lithium ion cells to be exact.   They start losing life around 60k miles. You can put off replacement until 100k, but expect range on a charge to drop.   By the way, the 12k price is if you buy in advance, they're **closer to $35,000** if you don't.   
-	-	Probably need more than that for information. I strongly doubt that pack was actually LiFePO4 (Lithium Iron Phosphate).
1	4	Good page. Shows how important it is to take large sources of energy very seriously.  So yes, much safer, but you cannot make something powerful enough to move a car around completely safe.  Of course, a short circuited battery, any battery, will generate a lot of heat, which will lead to anything flammable around it catching fire.    However, you'll notice from the picture there that the battery itself, while badly burned on one end, is still mostly intact.  It did not explode the way a compromised Li-Co battery, or a compromised gasoline tank would.    This is what makes it a much safer technology.
0	2	Your 'joke' contained misinformation.  Fox News is a 'joke' too, but still calls for rebuttal, since too many take these 'jokes' seriously.
1	4	I'm really glad to see that come to a conclusion.    Both of you provided evidence for your side, while keeping the childish insults minimal.  Well played, we should see more of these on Reddit.
-	-	You probably are, I am 26. But surely you can see the price of natural resources just steadily growing and growing, and the risk involved in extracting those resources becoming heavier? Surely the drive to clean energy is growing (and clearly, it is).   You might be a little older than me, and I might be a bit too optimistic - but that is no reason why you shouldn't shape the future you want either. You want renewable? Get a grant and put a few solar cells up on your roof.
-	-	Maybe for you... I'm on hydroelectric.
-	-	Well I was basing my arguments from a neutral efficiency standpoint, just to show why electric is preferential to petrol even with no net energy savings. Any advances in electric car efficiency only reinforces my argument. :)
-	-	Yeah electric cars are not cost effective yet.  Totally agree.  Petroleum is just too good of a fuel right now.
-	-	100 miles is plenty? What if I need to drive 300 miles today on a sales visit?  I guess I'll get a Prius.
1	4	I think he was referring to the fact the article came across as saying lithium batteries couldn't power cars at all, which is incorrect.  What it should have said was that the technology could produce lithium batteries that would work better and be more powerful for cars.
-	-	Learned that solid state batteries aren't the future yet? People developing electric "fuels" that you can fill your tank with to charge your battery are going to get all the pussy.
-	-	[deleted]
-	-	Sounds like when I subscribed to Wired Magazine and my mom subscribed to Time.
-	-	I want my flying car
-	-	100 miles. I do that in a week maybe. I could really use an electric car. Especcialy since I don't drive fast.
-	-	I know it's not an original idea, but I haven't seen it shot down..  Why not have "gas" stations swap the battery out with a charged one?  I know there are financial trickiness with the idea, since you'd have to make some kind of deposit, and how would the different stations be able to transfer that to each other as batteries are dropped off and picked up, etc.  But let's say we can figure that out, is it a good/bad idea from a technical perspective?
1	4	actually many cancers are very curable, the problem is people think of cancer as a singular illness when it is in fact a grouping of hundreds of different diseases.   there is no cure for cancer, just like there is no cure for bacterial infection as a whole. Each variation requires a different treatment and some are more effective than others.
0	5	Well, it takes ten years or more to turn promising research into treatments. If you expect that process to happen over the weekend (because let's be honest, you don't actually remember cancer research breakthroughs that were mentioned on reddit before last weekend), of course you *will* be disappointed.
0	2	A perfect battery won't solve anything.  Electric cars need electricity.  Electricity has to be generated.  Currently, and with few exceptions, it is generated by burning oil or coal.  We don't have enough energy of any sort left to make a transition to [solar, wind, fill in the blank with your favorite] plants and infrastructure UNLESS EVERYONE IN THE "DEVELOPED" WORLD CUTS THEIR ENERGY USE VERY DRAMATICALLY.
1	4	Every "breakthrough" science post:  Reading title - Awesome! This. Changes. Everything!  Reading the comments - *sniffle sniffle* oh well.....maybe next year.. *sniffle* 
1	4	no idea what any of that mumble jumbo means, but, good
-	-	They can already power electric cars.  Just not for very long. *trollface*
0	1	Who the fuck would downvote this? how could anyone see this as bad?
0	5	Too bad these technologies are owned by a 100 different companies.  Combine them into one product, and you'd change the world, but that's illegal. 
1	6	Electric cars...???What about my smartphone?

0	2	Awwww.... how i love "could, would, should, might" kind of news. Cancer and AIDS would be cured, we would be flying cars. Amazing life we'd be having if half of them actually came true. I'm basically saying that could would should might news should be better kept of from being posted, because they're almost always a false hope and a waste of time for readers.

0	2	Have you ever been mellow?
-	-	Well the got lots of government funding right? I always thought we were trying to promote our own production of batteries. You know, the same with oil; don't rely on other countries for our supply. I thought the Moli plant in canada was still kicking? Gotta try some of those li-mn! They have self balancing properties, so the need for regular balancing is less. My friends got 10K miles on his pack made from recycle tool packs with out a BMS.  you can get 10ah lifepo4 cells directly from headway by contacting them on alibaba in any quantity for around $15 a cell shipped. BUT you get absolutely no support or warranty. I'm guessing that a larger maker does much better QC which is very important, and very expensive. For example ordering directly from DLG rather than going through K2 who re-brands the DLG cell as their own cuts the price in half. But with out QC, or even a trusted seller you might be getting rejects out of cells made for large OEM orders. In fact, if you look at all the batteries sold for e-cigs and for flashlighs from places like deal extreme, I understand that they are rejects from large OEM orders like laptops. It's kinda funny seeing all these $1k+ ebike battery packs made from batteries of questionable quality. What can you do though, pay double or triple the price and order from an American seller? I'm in the middle of building a discharger to do my own testing before I build my next pack.... out of LIPO pouch cells meant for RC planes.   
0	5	ow. meme crossing brain breakage. that's like crossing the beams in ghostbusters.  and yes, i realize I just made it worse for myself with that thought
-	-	Where did anyone talk about cornering?  Also, no it's not.  Also, please tell me how cornering capability is at all related to power source.  Except, of course, in the sense that electric cars have the potential to corner much better than gas cars, because of the possibility of using independent wheel motors instead of a differential.  The E-Tron does this and apparently corners like a dream.
-	-	* &gt;Most likely, the person well knows the rule but typed too fast to get it right.   * &gt;I don't think it's about helping people learn the rules.

I doubt errors with As/as and I/i and in/n and other typos are really worth pointing out. Most likely, the person well knows the rule but typed too fast to get it right.  Precisely the problem.
1	8	In theory, they want the freedom. In practice, they live normal lives consisting of a predictable daily commute. And for that once or twice per year, rent an ICE car and drive to the beach or grandma's or whatever. 
-	-	If they do it only once every few months then rental makes sense. I know people that use a rental for long roadtrips because they don't trust their vehicle..
0	5	The sad part is, they all do. Honda, Toyota, Ford, Chevy, even Subaru.  They just don't sell them in the US because CA emissions is so heavily biased against diesel. 
1	4	Great, so you have a crappy car you can't justify replacing... :)  I just found that the Jetta, in 100 little ways, was a poorly thought-out, noisy vehicle that (for me) died way too soon to justify its considerable premium in up-front cost.
-	-	But shouldn't converting planes from petrochemical fuels to electric be a **goal**?
-	-	All-or-nothing solutions seldom intersect reality.    Pragmatically speaking, even a 10-20% market penetration of electrics would give us a much better energy-usage profile.  
-	-	Looks like Diesel is indeed higher carbon content than gasoline.  http://www.epa.gov/oms/climate/420f05001.htm#carbon  The higher energy density and especially the improved engine efficiency may more than offset the additional carbon emissions, though.
1	4	Agreed. But YeOldJim was basically saying "who cares?" about battery advances, because the current models have "plenty" of distance.  
0	2	Thanks for your input crazy homeless moron.
0	2	No kidding. Every wreck becomes a HAZMAT scene that makes sponging up some spilled gas look like nothing.

1	4	Thanks for that - yeah, definitely looks pretty sketchy.  They claim a test flight is supposed to occur on Oct 11 of this year, but judging by their history it seems doubtful this will actually happen.  Still, I'll make a note on my calendar just in case, remind myself to follow up on it then. 
1	4	I don't agree that the Prius looks like shit (though I do not own one), and generalizing the Prius owner base like that is silly. We don't all think those sports cars or big SUV's are pretty, some of us consider functionality to be the most important, such as a quiet car that burns little fuel.
-	-	Hello from [2009](http://www.gizmag.com/next-generation-battey-lithium-sulphur/11926/)
1	6	How can it be your favorite thing if it's never happened?
1	4	e-paper was a big one for me. I read the scientific articles and a few years later I had a kindle. Go scientific process!
1	4	There have been breakthroughs in this area too but haven't been used in consumer applications yet.  But I mean,  cars like the Nissan Leaf charge up to 80% capacity in 30 minutes.  Still not even close to as fast as gas but,  the battery technology is constantly moving forward.  I imagine it won't be too many more years when getting an 80% charge takes as little as 5 minutes,  and with increased battery capacity from breakthroughs like this,  that 5 minute 80% charge could be 200 miles worth.  Interstate travel would be feasible,  these cars would be quite a bit more reliable than gas cars and cheaper to drive,  there will be a mass exodus to electric cars.  And I will be happy,  because there will be more gasoline for me :3 well until they start making really cool electric performance cars :]
0	5	You can if you connect them to HVAC lines. It would be a nightmare for the controllers though, having to deal with current spikes. 
-	-	Its in the title, as graphene is involved in the process.
-	-	They haven't even built a working prototype yet :(
-	-	FTA  &gt;But there is more work ahead. Even though the material maintains a high specific capacity over 100 cycles, Wang and co say the capacity drops by 15 per cent in the process.  
-	-	How bout this?  I work in the Li-battery industry and any materials that have true commercial viability are kept under wraps because you don't want your competitors from using your technology.
1	4	Have you ever seen a lithium battery on fire?  /glad I could help.
-	-	What hopes? By the time it reaches the market in 5 years, lithium batteries will have improved in energy density by 25%-50% whether or not these batteries work out. Battery tech is advancing so quickly now days, and so much money is being thrown at it. It's a really exciting time to be interested in EVs. 
0	2	Touché :) but the efficiency of power plants vs car engines is not even a contest. Takes more energy to move a car using the engine and that's not even considering the heavier weight of the engine. In addition, power plant emissions are cleaner. So it's dirty, just not as dirty.  Regardless, greener sources of energy are growing in proportion so your car gets powered more and more by hydro, wind, and solar. 
-	-	Or in my case 8 hours of power consumption provided 100% by wind and solar.. 
1	4	&gt; Or you could buy a cheaper car ($20k)   And then you'd own a cheaper car.  You don't buy a Tesla to save money.  They're quite feasible for their (high-end) market.
1	8	Dude, the wealthy drive technological innovation.
-	-	I spend 2500 cad in 1 year just going back and forth from work. So in ten years I've made 5000 cad. 
-	-	Coal is just half the energy on the grid, not 100% of it.  Also, coal plants are baseload.  Coal plants don't track demand, they run at full output.  Coal pollution doesn't change when you plug in.  Furthermore, it takes electricity to refine the gasoline you put into your car.  Why is the electricity I put in my EV held to higher standards than the electricity the refinery puts into your gasoline?  At least the EV driver doesn't also burn petroleum.  There's a lot of energy waste built into your gasoline. That's why miles driven on gasoline (.12 to .30 per mile) is so much more expensive than EV miles driven on grid electricity (.01 to .06 per mile.)
-	-	also Tesla Motors are SMALL cars. Good for commuting, but most families will needs something quite a bit larger..
-	-	The Leaf is like 22k after rebates and has a 100 mile range.  Which, by the way, is well more than enough for the "common driver."
1	4	Many people are happy to blow similar amounts of money on performance cars that they drive around ordinarily, never even utilizing the available performance. They might as well spend that money on something like this that will push the industry in a more productive direction. 
-	-	They are also a high performance sports car, not a family sedan. 
1	4	It's been at least a month since I've read about another breakthrough battery technology.  
0	5	It's.  Sorry the grammar Nazi in me is screaming.
-	-	Hooray for collaboration destroying IP laws!
1	8	It's never too early to crush a dream.
-	-	Welp, I guess we're done here.  See you guys again this time tomorrow.
-	-	Of the battery or the hope-crushing comment?
1	4	Yes they have.   &gt; Even though the material maintains a high specific capacity over 100 cycles, Wang and co say the capacity drops by 15 per cent in the process. 
-	-	&gt; Wang and co say the capacity drops by 15 per cent in the process  Just noticed that.  Considering that this tech is going to be always more expensive, and likely extremely expensive in near term, this makes it broken.  Lithium is already acceptable in terms of energy discharge rates.  Its energy density that seems to cause unattractive compromises.
-	-	I'm guessing "gas" stations would have to have some sort of local storage to get through rush hour anyways.
-	-	True this. My friend works for an electric motorcycle company. He can't even talk about the new cells he is testing because they made him sign a NDA.   He told be about NMC lithium stuff, and I'd never heard of it. It sounds amazing though, and it's on the market. But only for OEM use, and the makers aren't exactly bragging about it. It makes you realize that most of the forward movement done in battery tech is done with out most people noticing. 
1	4	Yup exactly this. The battery industry is pretty secretive.  The article makes it sound like the cells may not have a high cycle life, and the issue of reacting with electrolytes could be an issue. That is neglecting the problem of economical graphene production.  If anything, it will be an incremental improvement in cells that few will notice.
1	4	What is this "everything else?" I haven't driven more than 50 miles in a day in probably 4 years. 
-	-	Wow, you have identified an enormous near-future business opportunity!  Think of all the apartment complexes, parking garages, curb-side parking spaces, etc.. that will need charging stations!  There are a lot of parking spaces that would be great places to throw up some solar panels to park under. You'd probably sell the energy to the electric utility and charge up the cars using the power grid.    The trick will be to first get an established base of electric cars on the road to make installing charging stations worth the investment.  The solar panels would be mostly marketing, although you might make some money on those as well.  That's why the car companies need to market them first as the family's 2nd vehicle, the kid's first car, and/or the almost zero maintenance commuter car.  They don't really need much range, no more than about 100 miles I would think, but they do need to be affordable.  No more than 15-20 kilo-dollars.  Electric cars are not going to fit in everywhere right away.  They will need to be phased in gradually, and they are definitely not going to be for everyone.
-	-	I agree but another fundamental problem is efficiency of energy conversion during storage and retrieval.  Combustion engines aren't close to 100%, think about how hot your car engine can get---that is all energy that was not used to make the wheels roll.
-	-	Not just that but large facilities (power stations) can run a lot more efficiently then small facilities (engines) and we also get the added bonus of not wasting as much energy via transmission (trucks to drive gas to stations to refill their reservoirs)
0	2	So I then end up with a rack of batteries that have been abused by some redneck "maker's" attempt a creating a quick charger?  No thanks.
-	-	So... in the future gas stations will be the size of a Super Wall-Mart?
-	-	[Voila!](http://www.wired.com/autopia/2009/05/better-place/)
-	-	An important question is: Do we need electrical cars that can go hundreds of miles? Why doesn't it suffice to go to the next train station, or to the gas powered car rental place for long distance or long transport trips?
-	-	100 cycles is far too small to be practical, except for a few specialised applications (e.g. occasional starting power, or something).  On the other hand, it's pretty normal to have poor lifetime for the initial prototypes, that can be improved with further development work.  If they can get that 100 to be 1000, then it's probably in business; and based on other work in electrodes in Li batteries, that's not an unreasonable goal.
-	-	So if I want to drive home from college to see my parents I need a new car?  These range issues aren't insurmountable, but they are serious.
0	2	While this is interesting, it took me some time to sound out most of the title.
-	-	Er, there already are lithium batteries capable of powering electric cars.  Citation: the electric car in my driveway with 24,000 miles on it.
-	-	We don't need better lithium ion batteries we need a fully sustainable fuel and a better car. I recommend following Henry Ford's fully functional Hemp based car. 
1	4	Yay! 5 years from now as I'm still stuck driving my gas guzzling beast I'll remember this momentous occasion.
-	-	Should someone tell Steve so he can enhance the battery life of his products?
-	-	I thought that lithium was already used in car batteries?  
-	-	With lithium will it finally be like the movies, where you blow up when you crash?
-	-	Can they use this to make a smartphone battery that will last longer than a business day?
0	2	There's a reason I haven't renewed my subscription to technology review.  I got tired of reading feel good bullshit articles like this one.  FTA: "If it all works out (and that's a significant 'if'). your next car could be powered by Li-S batteries."
-	-	graphene to the rescue!
0	5	Unfortunately it's also terrible at cornering.
-	-	The Tesla fails any test of acceleration when you go above 60 mph.  It is electronically limited to 120 mph.  The lower priced Corvette ZR1 does 0-60 in 3.3 and 0-100 in 7.1 seconds.  The $125,000 Tesla Sport takes 10.9 seconds to hit 100.   That's not even in the same ballpark. 
0	1	No I'm talking record breaking drag times.  Why isn't there an electric car that can hit 330 mph in under 5 seconds?  They certainly have not "buried the ICE" when it comes to drag racing. 
-	-	what animosity? what are you talking about? I think the pure electrics are great. everyone that doesnt travel much outside their city should get one. I'd love one, if I had any means to charge it. Why are *you* displaying such animosity and seeming to not even read my words before incorrectly criticizing?
0	5	I didn't imply that you hadn't, merely that most people don't rent a convertible for a short 3 hour trip. I certainly couldn't afford to do so.
0	2	I disagree. Loads of people want to be able to drive more than 100 miles *sometimes*. Not daily. People need to visit family, friends, take vacations, camping trips, visit prospective campuses, etc.., and most just like having the ability to travel, the freedom.  Be angry or hate it or whatever you want, it simply is the case.
0	1	Because some people care about family? God damn man, are you stupid?
-	-	My point is, the average citizen can't afford these cars yet.  The coal observation was merely a uninformed observation I won't defend, other than to say we are using coal for power, right or wrong. That'll hopefully change before everyone makes the switch.  
-	-	&gt;as i sed n mi pervius cawmint' its bout perventing dis;  I pointed out why this particular type of error is unlikely to lead to that.  You can respond to the point of my post if you like.
1	6	Funny enough, not one you often see.
-	-	Lipo and LiFePO4 are different things.  Lipo batteries are lithium polymer, and these are usually made with the same dangerous lithium cobalt chemistry.  LiFePO4 are lithium-iron-phosphate. These batteries are essentially non-flammable.  The chart on this page:  http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/the_high_power_lithium_ion  Rates Lithium Iron Phosphate and Lithium Manganese Oxide as the "most safe" of the lithium battery chemistries.  This video:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwIl8f3WI0s  Shows an LiFePO4 battery being 'chomped' into pieces while still continuing to function.
0	5	[Of course, Sandia and the manufacturers want to prevent all possible dangers. But, Orendorff asserts, consumers forget that no car is completely hazard-proof. Lithium-ion batteries may have a higher chance of igniting than, say, standard lead-acid batteries, “but the chances of flammability are far less than what you have in a combustion vehicle that is carrying 15 gallons of gasoline onboard.”](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=charge-under-control). Please don't fall into a nirvana argument trap. The chance of lithium ion batteries catching fire in a collision is far less then the chance of gasoline igniting. 
0	5	Like tears...
0	2	Yeah it's no fun. It's annoying that a123 got tons of federal money to open a battery plant here in the states, and yet the only way for consumers to get their batteries is off the asian gray market.   I've found asian companies are usually willing sell in much smaller quantities straight out the factory even if they state MOQ at like 10,000 units. 
1	4	Great Blade Runner reference.

0	1	Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
-	-	What if the truck passes through your gasoline-based vehicle and splits open the lithium battery of the cell phone in your pocket?
-	-	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_iron_phosphate_battery  "...Due to significantly stronger bonds between the oxygen atoms in the phosphate (compared to the cobalt), oxygen is not readily released, and as a result, lithium iron phosphate cells are virtually incombustible in the event of mishandling during charge or discharge, and can handle high temperatures without decomposing."
1	4	I agree with the sentiment, but not so much the context you've used it. You're essentially saying that renewables and fission are not our future sources for energy? And switching to renewables and fission will not happen within 10 years?
0	1	Well of course a leaf will be more efficient than an M3, the leaf doesn't use any petrol at all! 
-	-	Electric cars have decent mileage for the average commuter (about 70-100 miles per charge). Most people don't go over that amount in a day. Hell, I drive 40 minutes twice a day to get to my university and that's just a total of 40 miles. I think most people will just plug it in when they get home and forget about it until morning.
-	-	Replaceable batteries wouldn't be an awful idea considering the point that "the material maintains a high specific capacity over 100 cycles, Wang and co say the capacity drops by 15 per cent in the process." (11th paragraph)  Although I didn't consider that a car may need LOTS of batteries to operate, which would not be an option to exchange...
-	-	Then you'll be paying the same price for an even more sub standard car from a company that doesn't know how to make them.
-	-	What if... who knows, all I can deal with is present state.   I can tell you the manufacturing process is quite different.  Their bodies come in prefab, and they just join the drive train to them.  So, getting a mass produced body won't help (GM plant).  There aren't any lines that pack the battery cells its done by hand (in racks). So acquiring a factory isn't going to solve the problem(s).  The rotor is very sensitive, and is checked by hand, each one. Tesla isn't in the business to replace cars, they wanted to prove its possible and someone would buy it.  They proved that it works in small quantities. They'll leave it to GM or Ford or Toyota to figure out the mass production. 
-	-	Then you'll be paying the same price for an even more sub standard car from a company that doesn't know how to make them.
-	-	And H2O is the predominate [greenhouse gas](http://scienceofdoom.com/2011/02/24/water-vapor-vs-co2-as-a-greenhouse-gas/) in our atmosphere.  We should ban these now!!!   (That's sarcasm for the extra dense in the crowd.)    
-	-	Improving on existing batteries is exactly what they did here.  They looked into one of the weaknesses of lithium batteries, and tried to make it better.  Don't get hung up on that "breakthrough" in the title...it's only there to make you keep reading.
0	1	Which is useful, but then most electric cars can only hold about 40 miles of that energy, and the price of the "tank" is astronomically higher. However, the price of fuel is astronomically lower (A gallon of gas, on a hybrid, good for about 40 miles, is ~$4 where I live. 8 kilowatt hours, which should get at least that if not double, will come out to $0.72-1.20, depending on time of day (electricity is nearly half price at night)).  As such, the day someone makes a battery that gets decent charge cycles on a total range of at least 200 miles, the internal combustion engine is straight-up **fucked**. However, until then, we're stuck with them.
-	-	I think nuclear could work. Especially if you used every kind of nuclear fuel, from recycling waste to uranium to thorium to resparking depleted uranium that isn't considered nuclear waste.
0	1	Oil is too expensive to make electricity. Less than 3% of electricity is currently made that way.  Coal is about half the electricity on the grid.  The rest of what's on the grid is cleaner stuff.  The good news here is that coal plants are baseload.  This means they already run at full output all the time.  You can't make them run any faster by plugging in EVs.  So coal pollution shouldn't appreciably change, while petroleum pollution heads towards zero.
1	4	They can use gas too, just like the Volt. It's going to be long, long time before there are electric cars capable of 5 day road trips. In the meantime—while research continues to be done, while infrastructure is improved—there is a perfectly reasonable fallback. The real goal right now is to make an electric car in which the battery charge can fully cover your daily commute. That alone would reduce oil usage by cars in this country by 75%. 
-	-	The only practical way is to have switchable batteries. You drive into a "gas" station and a rack of flat battries are switchf out with a rack of charged. What coudl be interesting to this model is it coudl be a flat rate model. You pay x a month to them and they do a deal with the power compaies for off peak power etc.
0	2	&gt;I've got it in my head that the average US commuter drives 30-40 miles per day. We need to convince most of those folks (myself included) to switch to electric.  The problem is that not many can afford to have a car that only commutes and a car to do everything else.  Especially using battery technology that degrades horribly with charge cycles and will be expensive to replace.  So unless reducing costs makes the car cost as much as a nice bicycle, you are better off buying a dinosaur burning global warmer.  
-	-	Because no technological innovation has ever made its way into the electric vehicle market before. /s
-	-	The processes they are talking about (nanotech, and trapping sulphur in Gr$phene) sound very expensive to mass produce.  This is just an improvement in the cathode side.  It won't improve charge times, and as best as I understand (not formally educated in area) at least in a serial battery arrangement both anode and cathode capacities have to be balanced.  Lithium does pretty well currently in watts/$ (even though it is last among viable tech), I don't know but think, this tech is just doubling the watts per gram (anode becomes limiting instead of current cathode), but it may be decreasing the watts per $.
-	-	Electric motors have amazing torque curves compared to ICEs. With a proper power source, an electric motor will bury any ICE on any test of acceleration. 
-	-	Then take the ~22k Leaf.
-	-	Naturally occurring, yes, but in nanoparticle form, no. My understanding is that most TiO2 (and other) nanoparticles are synthesized through colloidal suspension, which is (relatively) easy and mass-produceable because it can be done in large batches.
1	4	&gt;Which is useful, but then most electric cars can only hold about 40 miles of that energy, and the price of the "tank" is astronomically higher  Uh, what?  "Most" electric cars have about a 100 mile range.  And they will probably all settle on about that range.  Because more range than that is simply not worth it.  Consumers will buy a car with the range they need, and 100 miles is the most the vast majority needs.  In fact, most need less than that, but 100 miles seems to be the sweet spot.  Which is why that's what they're settling on.  Some manufacturers might end up with tiered options like the Model S, but when consumers are given a choice between a reasonably-priced base model with 100 mile range, and an upgraded model which costs an extra 10 grand for 150 or 200 miles, they'll get the base model, because you really do not need more than 100 miles worth of range, and on the rare occasion that you do, you'll charge mid-drive or figure out some other way of dealing with it.  Can you show me a single all-electric car on the market or planned to come out in the next year or two which holds 40 miles worth of range?  The only one is the Volt, and it's not all-electric.  Even the EV1 got 60-100 miles, and that was on lead acid, which nobody in the world is going to use now.  &gt;As such, the day someone makes a battery that gets decent charge cycles on a total range of at least 200 miles, the internal combustion engine is straight-up fucked.   The Tesla gets 240 miles on a charge, the Model S will get 160 for the base model.  I know a guy who has had an electric car for two years and has over 60k miles on it, and his gets 100 to a charge, and after 600+ charge cycles including many in brutal winter cold, his battery still works just fine.  And today's electric cars, just a couple years later, have much better heat management which should make batteries last a lot longer.  The only reason the internal combustion engine isn't fucked right now is because people don't realize that they can, currently, live with an electric car.  It takes a tiny bit of adjustment, but this adjustment is by no means all negative.  For example, I have never had to stop at a gas station in my electric car, it's just magically full every morning when I wake up.
-	-	Why do you visit them so often? 
-	-	&gt;But that is 8 hours of power consumption, provided by coal.  Even on 100% coal, which by the way exists nowhere outside of West Virgina, an electric car is cleaner per-mile.  It's easier to control emissions from one smokestack than 10,000 tailpipes, and more efficient to generate power in large amounts rather than in a tiny gas engine.  Gas engines get at most 20% efficiency out of every gallon they burn, in addition to drilling, shipping, refinement etc. costs.  However, as I said, almost nobody has 100% coal power.  My power company, for example, uses no coal whatsoever, and it's not some fancy small provider that's extra expensive, it's the standard power company here.  Further, as the grid gets cleaner, electric cars will automatically get cleaner as well, without having to be altered in any way at all.  This goes for installing solar on your roof as well, if you get solar then your car is completely clean, and free to drive to boot.
-	-	&gt;compared to 5 minutes for a gas fill-up  There's roughly 36Kwh in a gallon of gasoline.  Assuming the improved thermodynamics of an electric car assume 6Kwh usable.    Most gas stations pump close to 10GPM which is ~ 3 MW that the charging station would have to support to get an equivalent charge rate..    That will never happen.  The best you could do is swap out the whole battery pack (which could be automated if it was standardized)  What you will see are mostly electric range extended serial hybrids like the Volt, which doesn't require a change in driver behavior, OR a change in driver behavior.. 
-	-	My standards for a road trip are wildly different than my standards for commuting to and from work.  I wouldn't want to take my day-to-day car on a road trip now, and it burns gas.  I'd get a rental.  Why would an electric car change that?
-	-	That's a flaw of the US' infrastructure, not a technological one.  There are other countries, too, remember?
-	-	wut
1	4	I think we don't need to give up freedom or utility. Either the technology or infrastructure just needs to progress. We're gettin' closer all the time. It's an exciting time. I can't wait to ditch the ICE forever.
-	-	I dont think it makes economic sense, assuming say 20 days/year travel.
-	-	Electric cars have the potential to corner much better. However, the Tesla Roadster uses the chassis from a Lotus Elise which was designed for the weight distribution of a gasoline engine and the use of proper racing tires. As a result, the Lotus handles much, much better.
-	-	every time this subject pops up, i get spidy tingles...  &gt; You must consider thermodynamic quality of energy.  apples and oranges.  quality of energy has little to do with tank-to-wheel conversion.  this is like comparing open system efficiency vs. closed system efficiency dealing with thermodynamics.  you can't compare wet fuel cell with external oxidant vs dry cell with internal chemical energy potential in similar manner because of this.  EPA tried to do this in their crazy complex MPGe and GGE conversion using miles/BTU scheme when in fact, driving with heater on during winter will kill this MPGe rating for any electric cars while heat engine vehicles will not be effected.  Also electricity to mechanical work conversion is more efficient as long as electric vehicle cargo load weight is efficient.  This is where energy density plays the biggest role, not quality of energy.
-	-	Not to mention you need way less components for an electric car which are also lighter. 
-	-	[Then go break a bunch of quarter mile drag racing records with a 1970s Datsun.](http://www.plasmaboyracing.com/whitezombie.php)
-	-	you talkin' bout the $100k roadster? yeah let's all go buy that..
-	-	The point is that until charge stations are widespread and there's some way to charge batteries fairly quickly (compared to 5 minutes for a gas fill-up that'll last you several hundred miles) any electric car will, for anyone who goes on road trips from time to time, either be impractical, a not-main car, or need to also have a gasoline engine.
-	-	Yes I know you don't need it every day. I live 3 hours from most of my family. I visit monthly. I still need a car that can do that drive.
-	-	But that is 8 hours of power consumption, provided by coal.    Hopefully as more and more people adopt electrics we can shift to wind, etc.   Merely a pointless observation, I'd like to see us off coal in 10 years. 
-	-	the 300mile range model will cost $60k. Or a buyer can get a gas car with more range, and more utility for $9k. So uh.. no problem not solved.
0	2	&gt; U.S. pricing for the Tesla Model S (with a **160-mile range**) will start at $49,900 **after a $7,500 federal tax credit**. The 230-mile range variant will cost an additional $10,000, while the **300 mile range variant will cost an extra $20,000**. Final pricing figures will be announced this summer.  That's $70,000 for 300 mile range.  Or you could buy a cheaper car ($20k) and spend 20k on gas, and pocket the other *thirty thousand dollars*.   They're not ~~available~~ feasible for the common driver.
-	-	Aye. Well the goal is obviously to get off gas totally.. and there's just no way that can happen with present battery tech.
1	4	Right, I suppose my comment was misleading.  I was just trying to point out that graphene hidden amongst graphite does exist naturally.
1	4	Interesting, any other examples? Specifically, I am interested if any of the more complex stuff has leaked into the consumer market behind my back.  A quick google reveals that TiO2 is a naturally occurring compound.
-	-	Modern gasoline-powered engines are closer to 25-30%, not 15%.  (Not that I disagree with your overall point.)
1	6	this should push the Thunderbolt to six whole hours!
-	-	I think in the short term, that lithium-ion is what we are stuck with. There are improvements that are possible with that though (e.g. silicon nanowire anodes).  Even with graphene, the main issue will still be the price. As more electric cars are sold, the marginal cost will come down, just like every other technology. The real issue is that until gasoline becomes far more expensive, industry will not sell enough electric cars to bring the price down. So personally I think we will continue using gasoline for a long time, regardless of the negative geopolitical and environmental effects. The oil and gas industry still has plenty of sources to exploit (fracking every well they've ever done in the past, deep ocean, north pole). 
-	-	Antimatter. 
1	4	That's sweet
-	-	There is also an iPhone app called "Find Nano" from the Woodrow Wilson Center.
-	-	I believe, electric cars are for everyone.  The problem here (at least in this century) is that source and method of storage and transmitting electricity by demand.  as you know, electricity is a commodity market as coal and petroleum are.  If we were to convert even small portion of gas vehicle to electric, could market keep up with demand?  or could market come up with cost effective strategic infrastructure to meet those demands?  It's not like wind or solar power maintain themselves.  I don't think anyone has yet come up with viable "profitable" solution to meet the demand criteria.  Especially transmission line (the grid) hasn't been invested in so long (due to extremely high cost and low return), anything "new" will take some effort and very very very loooooong time....
-	-	Ever taken a train from Houston to Dallas? Takes like 11 hours. I can drive that distance in less than 5.  That's why.  Edit: Oops, I just checked Amtrack and the shortest available trip is [17.5 hours](http://i.imgur.com/M6DrV.png).
-	-	While this is blue sky, i find myself wondering what kind of total improvement we can look at if this gets combined with the lithium "mesh" tech.
-	-	Now the car manufacturers that work with the oil suppliers have something new to shelve.
0	2	UncleAl's comment: This is not snit.
-	-	FTA: "The next step then is to create a working battery out of this stuff."
0	5	What annoys me about this is that even if this proves to be the best idea ever, we'll have to wait at least like five years for it to be implemented in anything.
-	-	And how will this affect the environmental impact of lithium batteries? 
-	-	"Even though the material maintains a high specific capacity over 100 cycles, Wang and co say the capacity drops by 15 per cent in the process." not ready yet.
-	-	Apparently graphene is the solution to all of the world's problems.  Now if they could just put it out to market...
1	4	Why are all these article the same? They are always in 3 parts: start) Breakthrough!!11! - middle) Much work ahead - end) If they are lucky
1	7	finally, some progress
-	-	Have you ever been in a Turkish prison?
-	-	I see what you did there.
-	-	Well, it isn't like you have much choice in North America, there aren't exactly a ton of manufacturers based in non-asian countries.  Also, welcome to the world of low volume production, it is a pain when a company doesn't want to just build you 5 of something, because it isn't worth their time if they can't do a run of 100 or 1000. I've had to sweet talk companies into doing runs smaller than their minimums just because we would never use them all. Even then, I've had to order much more than we would like to use.  
-	-	All those moments will be lost in time...
1	4	&gt; The lithium in a battery is as harmless as the sodium in table salt.  Interesting.
0	3	Li-Co is more dangerous, but I've still seen lifepo4 and li-mn fires. 
1	6	That was shocking.
-	-	The article was meant an example. No matter how current the report lithium still burns at the same temperature... and from a quick look into it, it appears fire safety is still quite a problem.  &gt; The batteries have vastly improved since then.  Care to back that statement up with the slightest shred of evidence?  I see a few improvements in preventing thermal runaway to prevent spontaneous fire but noting about what happens when a truck runs over your Prius, splits your battery pack in half and catches it on fire.
0	2	Considering the amount of gasoline in use every day it would appear to be extremely safe. I guess when there's as many lithium battery cars driving around as there are gas powered cars we'll have some idea of relative safety.  /keeping in mind my original post was a joke.
-	-	EV lithium batteries (usually lithium-iron-phosphate or lithium manganese) are not combustible.  The poster was trying to scare you with lithium-cobalt batteries, which are not EV batteries.
-	-	To be fair you can't exactly go out and buy most lithium ion cells unless you are an oem, too many safety issues otherwise.  Also, most companies try and avoid telling what tech they use, especially if they don't have a patent on it. Some companies do copy other companies cells. But it is pretty hard to enforce IP law in China.
-	-	More like HOORAY FOR PEOPLE STEALING YOUR IDEAS AND THEN MAKING MONEY OFF OF THEM!  This is why academia is better.  People aren't out for the money. They are out for the recognition.  (which leads to money)  Gotta say though, they aren't exaggerating when they say that 600 mAh/g cathodes would make monster batteries.  We'll see if they can actually upscale it though.  From experience, that is where most materials lose their viability.
0	1	So, once again Reddit has no sense of humor... okay, I'll respond as if this was a serious post.  &gt; Have you ever seen gasoline explode?  Yes, I have. Gasoline is designed to be stable and burn at a relatively low temperature. To make it **explode** requires a very specific set of conditions that very seldom occur during a automobile collision. Not to mention gasoline fires are relatively easy to extinguish by trained fire crews.  Gasoline burns at ~560 degrees C. Lithium at ~2,500 degrees C.  A nice little story: http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0UBT/is_29_18/ai_n6280925/  My favorite part: "The pallet was inadvertently dropped onto the tarmac, and a battery fire resulted, despite there being no external ignition source."  &gt; We already deal with inherent dangers in our vehicles, a burning battery isn't much worse.  Sorry, but bullshit. 
-	-	Have you ever seen C-beams glitter in the dark?
0	1	that is an examle of your favorite thing.   Inductive chargers suck ass

-	-	Some cities (E.g. Boston) have charge stations on some streets already.
1	7	Damn, that's awesome.  Is that in production at all?  How much does it cost?  Couldn't find any pricing on the website.
-	-	&gt;fill in the blank with your favorite  LFTR.
-	-	The fossil fuel crisis is an energy storage problem, not an energy problem. Fossil fuels are so essential because they are pre-stored energy in a readily usable form.  Come up with good, affordable, durable, high density energy storage technologies and we have no energy problem. We are constantly bathed in energy in the form of solar and wind, and there are many other sources as well: gen-IV nuclear, geothermal, tidal, biofuels, etc.  But most of these have intermittency problems. The entire energy problem is really storage, not generation. 
-	-	Granted, if you introduce electrical cars, you centralize the places whre oil and coal are burned, and if the technology comes availiable to throw them out, you can "just" replace the power plants and suddenly, all those electrical cars on the street are green.   If every single car burns processed oil, you can just not do this. 
-	-	Done.  limit multi-tasking.
-	-	Because they are press releases reporting the results of research.  Learning about research in the early stages is good. Unfortunately, the press releases are written by the PR department, so they tend to use words like "breakthrough" a lot. It's especially bad in companies looking for investors.  So, apply PR filter and extract whatever useful content you can.
0	1	thank you for wasting my time
-	-	I don't think the issue of charging is problem of technology or even infrastructure at this moment in time.  It's more a problem of marketing.  These cars need to be marketed as the family's 2nd car, a commuter car, or the kid's first car.    For most people, an electric car that got a real-world-driving range of around 100 miles and could charge up in 8 hours, would be more than adequate for their daily driving needs.    With a 100 miles, most people could drive to work and back, pick up the kids at school, go grocery shopping and to the gym, and still have enough energy in the battery pack to forget to plug it in one night and still make it to work and back the next day.  It would be like your cell phone.  You use it during the day and charge it up overnight.
0	2	I literally can't respect any post that says gr$phene. 
-	-	We also have a lot of business and residential roofs that don't have solar cells on them.   I hate the argument "it all comes from fossil fuels" because while that is mostly true now it doesn't have to be. 
0	2	Nonsense. Our energy use is not the issue at all. We (the world collectively) use a tiny fraction of the energy available to us. What we need to do is improve our methods of extracting that energy into usable forms. Cutting energy use is not going to promote this. Only energy scarcity will do that.
-	-	"finally"?  lithium batteries are capable of powering electric cars *right now*.  Also, the major adoption bottleneck right now is not energy density, but charging.  Lithium energy density is already good enough for a wide array of applications, including commuting.
-	-	There are many, many consumer applications that use nano (it's kinda my job to know these things). Gustomaximus has a link to find such products: The most common nanoparticle used in consumer products is nano silver. Silver inhibits the growth of bacteria (that's why silverware is so great), and so nano silver is a very effect anti-bacterial product.  You find it in socks, bandages, Tupperware, deodorants, and many other products where bacterial growth would be a problem. Carbon Nanotubes:  used in hockey sticks and tennis rackets. Nano Zinc Oxide or Titanium dioxide: sunscreens (it's very effective, too!).  But they're also used in paints (TiO2) as photocatalyst (don't worry, they coat tio2 for use in sunscreen so it doesn't catalyze molecules).  Costmetics also use ZnO and TiO2, but cosmetics are also incorporating other nanoparticles so that certain "anti-oxidants" or other products could more readily be absorbed by the skin. (And yes, there are risks using this stuff that need to be researched).  Silicon nanoparticles:  very effective in creating hydro and oleophobic surfaces making them anti-graffiti. Biomemetics:  scientists can create hierarchical structures that mimic natural hierarchical structures.  For example, the Lotus leaf is a super hydrophobic surface due to micro and nano structures.  You can get nanotex khaki pants that use this (better water repelling tech than scotch guard) Photonics:  creating nm sized gaps which reflect specific wavelengths.  Qualcom is using MEMS to create color reflective displays. Ferrofluid:  nano particles of iron oxide used to lubricate hard drives.   There are also, many electronic interfaces (mostly glass) that use nanometer thick coatings.  I'm just scratching the surface.

-	-	I wouldn't be surprised if the companies willing to sell you lower quantities are selling them to you off books. In that case, they just pull a box of 100 off the line and ship them to you.  Companies in North America are held to higher standards and can't just take cells off the line to sell them to you. Each sale costs them money to put on the books, and for quantities less then 10,000 it may mean that they lose money from the sale. Do you know what the unit price on cells typically is? I only know the cost of manufacturing them (which I'm probably not allowed to divulge), so I have no idea what kind of margins these companies are getting.  The A123 plant kinda confused me, it opened a year and a bit after the only other major plant in North America (owned by E-One Moli) shut down production because it wasn't feasible to manufacture cells in North America.

0	1	Hello!!! The original post was a joke... is this thing on? Hello!
-	-	Here is a lifepo4 battery that went into thermal runaway and caught fire.   http://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=18577&amp;start=0  As I said, "Safer" but not completely "safe"   Above, I mis-spelled lifepo4. I have a 1Kwh lifepo4 sitting in the other room, and a 1.5kwh lipo pack I'm currently assembling and testing. I feel much safer with the lifepo4. No need for fire protection. For the lipo pack I'm wrapping it in fire proof fiber glass.   Here's a defective lipo pack that caught fire the first time it was hooked up. It really makes it clear the need for very strong QC and testing!  http://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=29256  Btw: battery university is decent, but always around 5-10 years behind the times WRT to lithium.

1	4	This is very much correct.   @cogman10: Other consumer products that use nano particles include things like thermalpaste (ie. Arctic Silver 5) which uses nano silver. Nano silver is also used as an anti bacterial coating on medical instruments,etc. 
0	1	 No.
0	1	your post is full of terrible grammar and spelling.

-	-	On the other hand, people error on the homonyms because they are typing the words their hearing in their head without thinking too hard about it.  The its/it's thing is particularly pernicious because it's a case that really breaks the general rules about apostrophes, where an apostrophe means possessive and contraction, but in this case it's been changed for the possessive case.  When speaking you'd never know they err'd, you know.  I doubt errors with its/it's and their/they're/there and other homonyms are really worth pointing out.  Most likely, the person well knows the rule but typed too fast to get it right.  Note, my own homonym mistake left as is.

0	3	Zing! Obama. 
-	-	It has?  The very first electric car ever to be sold in America does 0-60 in 3.7.  That beats well over 99% of cars ever available, it's something like the 15th fastest accelerating car available now.
0	1	Because it fucks up the weight balance is one reason. Even the Tesla Roadster is absolutely terrible at cornering, especially compared to the  Lotus Elise it's based on. Hopefully as new vehicles are built around the technology, such as the Citroen Survolt, that problem will be worked out.
-	-	Not really typical are you? No sense having animosty towards the idea just cause it wouldn't work for you. It isn't like gas cars will vanish off the face of the earth once electrics become viable... there will just be less of them.
-	-	You mean why haven't electrics taken over? Battery technology isn't quite there yet, and oil is still cheap relatively speaking. 
0	5	Modern battery chemistrie­s are relatively non-toxic (e.g. NIMH and Li-Ion.)  Quote from NEMA:  http://www.nema.org/gov/ehs/committees/drybat/  "Spent consumer lithium batteries are not hazardous wastes because they are neither toxic nor reactive. Consumers routinely dispose of these batteries commingled with other garbage in the municipal solid waste stream. Spent consumer lithium batteries disposed in this manner do not pose environmen­tal or safety hazards. Thus, there is no need to require the collection and recycling of spent consumer lithium batteries for the purposes of environmen­tal protection­."  Sadly, the same cannot be said for petroleum products and coolant, all of which are indeed toxic. 
-	-	Yes, but shouldn't using bold in all posts be **discouraged**?
0	5	Perhaps a very long-term goal, but currently a pipe-dream. In the nearer-term, getting any significant portion of vehicles off fossil fuel is beneficial, and arguably doable.  For some applications and in some areas, the properties of petroleum make it the obvious choice. Then you have to consider that china and india are building coal plants and opening coal mines at increasing rates. The use of fossil fuels is going to linger for a long time. We won't stop using them until we have to. Hard to say when that will occur.
-	-	I don't think you understand how jet engines work. They need hydrocarbons to run.   Perhaps we can switch to some sort of biofuel?
-	-	my experience with a 2003 passat is the same ie it too much trouble for the cost
1	4	Not sure why people are downvoting you.  You had a bad experience with your car, that would leave me reason to not be a fan of it.  I got 4-banger engine that doesn't appear to be dying too soon.  Any problems have been small, even when they seemed catastrophic, and fortunately there are a lot of dedicated Jetta owners posting on forums.  I google my problems, go to a forum, and often have a detailed step by step with pictures for something I would never have known how to fix.  VW right now is expensive, though.  On top of that I am someone that never intends to buy a brand new car, so I guess it works out differently for me.  As is, I would gladly purchase a *new* used Jetta.  
-	-	The only way I can see it happening is to seriously raise taxes on gasoline once it becomes economically feasible for electric cars.  I think a graduated increase would make the most sense, each year raising it another 50 cents or dollar per gallon until it's only used by those who need it.  There may be some sort of rebate provided for people that prove a necessity (or maybe a lower tax on biodiesel).  I'm not sure how trucking can be handled yet.
-	-	On average, can you agree that at the moment, the entire process of electric car vs petrol car is about the same in terms of energy efficiency? Ok, well let me list some positives of changing to electric:  *  As you said, pollution moved from roads to power plants. Even if efficiency is unchanged, wouldn't you rather cleaner air in the places we live? *  Electric cars require little to no maintenance past changing tyres *  Less noise generation *  Most importantly - setting us up to switch to cleaner energy sources once they become viable. 
0	2	I love how you talk about all the efficiency losses from power generation, and don't say any of the same for gas.  If gas is so efficient, why do we not run our houses on gas power?  We all have cars, we could just run the car in the garage and connect it to the house, and power our house that way.  It would be way more efficient right?!  Except, no, that's not how it works.  Gas engines get something like 20% efficiency, maximum.  And that's from the gas already in the tank - there are additional efficiency losses from extraction, refinement, and shipping, of course.  Power plants also do not run at 30% efficiency, that is a truly ridiculous number.  The whole point of generating in a plant is that you can get higher efficiency by using large, industrial generators rather than tiny gas engines.  You can also control emissions better at one smokestack than 10,000 tailpipes, and in addition having that pollution out of a city *is* a good thing, because it's closer to less people.  The well-to-wheel efficiency of electric cars is tremendously greater than gas cars, even on 100% coal.  But nearly nobody powers their house with 100% coal, so your argument is basically nothing.
-	-	&gt; You're just moving that pollution out of town to a coal plant somewhere  Which would be a huge plus in itself. Lower polution levels where most people actually live and work would do wonders for public health and safety. It would even be a win if total pollution went up (slightly).
-	-	Tesla roadster will do over 200 miles on one charge. Fast charger takes it from 20 to 80% in ~40 minutes if i remember correctly. Nissan leaf will do ~100 miles. That's plenty. The batteries are expensive though, as at the moment they're laptop batteries scaled up.
0	2	yes.. for 40 miles, max. A typical gas car has a range of 300-400 miles, with ubiquitous fill stations everywhere taking just 5 minutes, not 8+ hours. That's one hell of a utility gap.
1	6	Wow, didn't expect this kind of heated response.  I apologize for breaking reddiquette; however I do agree with the responses to this post.  I see correction posts constantly, and I feel like they help others learn written English.  How many of you wrote "definately"?  People typically don't want to be ignorant, so I didn't see the harm in pointing him in the right direction.  
-	-	So what?
-	-	well it's just the consistent process of making graphene that is new.  the chemical has been around for a long time.
-	-	shoulders of giants.
-	-	That is the biggest problem with all these nano-breakthroughs. Besides transistor techs, I don't think I've seen a consumer product yet that heavily uses nano-tech.
-	-	The semiconductor industry is looking at graphene as the next step after silicon scaling becomes more difficult. So if graphene chips take off, then the battery industry will benefit from the scaling of transistors. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has to figure out how to cheaply add dopants for various reasons (e.g. n/p-channels in CMOS, high-K gates).  So I don't see scaling of this as a huge problem, at least not in 10-15 years.
0	1	We must not allow a hope-crushing comment gap!
1	7	That's someone saying "Here's something that might work." This article is saying "Hey, this works!"
-	-	It seems clear to me that we're talking about a potential future with all-electric cars, not gas/electric hybrids like the Volt.  Those almost certainly will only exist during the transition period.
-	-	Prototype?  They've been functioning over spec for years.
-	-	Please don't:  Listen to what iregistered4this has put in his comment. At least not for me. Correct me all you want. I care about the quality of my writing, and accept any corrections.   Except for using it as a debate method against an opponent. Don't do that, it's what people resort to in lieu of valid arguments. 
-	-	This is the second time I've seen someone quote this, and I have some problems with it. For one, it is expected to go around correcting people when they are wrong factually, morally, or contextually, why the hell not when it concerns spelling or grammar? That is the nature of discussion, and this is a discussion website. For two, you don't know if they know that they made the mistake, whether they want to be corrected or not, and in the case of an ambiguous error which way the word was intended. For three, where on Earth do you draw the line? Just how badly of grammer do you let someon get away with at all? Obviously there is a point at which it must be corrected. This catchall, whiny rule needs to be redefined. I suspect it's not about whether or not it adds to the conversation, but whether or not it adds to the load their servers are under. 
0	2	deamon ?
-	-	But what keeps people using proper grammar and spelling is the social ramification. If we don't remind each other that we care, our format of communication cud sllide intu tha bad plase,
-	-	I have a Chevy Volt.  Yeah, it only gets ~40 miles on electric charge, but after that it runs off gas, getting ~55 mpg.  There's not really any downside... normal commute on electric, long trips very efficiently on gas.
-	-	Or get an M3. Top Gear proved that the BMW M3 was more fuel efficient than a Toyota Prius! *   *there would be fine print here, but I don't know how to do that.
1	4	Actually the Jetta TDI is probably the most fuel efficient car (excluding pure electrics) when you consider embodied energy. The Prius is complex to manufacture since it has two drive trains, more or less.  A TDI can be tuned to get &gt;60mpg on the highway. It's mostly because diesels operate at a higher compression ratio and are inherently more efficient than Otto-cycle gasoline engines.  You can also use biodiesel in a TDI.  IMHO on efficiency/renewability the best cars are:  Nissan Leaf: if your driving pattern is short, routine, frequent commutes. The Leaf is built for the "standard Los Angeles commuter driving pattern."  Volkswagen Jetta TDI: If you need range or your driving pattern is infrequent, longer commutes. You can use biofuels if you want and dispense with fossil petroleum entirely.  On cost the TDI wins. 
-	-	Figure out some way to import a VW Bluemotion and you just may win.

-	-	Rent a different car for the day, but I don't think traveling salesman is the target market.
0	5	Project better place already operates on this idea, but imo it will only work for fleet cars that can all run on a standard model since different car manufacturers use different batteries with different sizes (getting everyone to agree on a standard battery is practically impossible)  See this recent link: http://green.autoblog.com/2011/07/05/better-place-to-install-20-battery-swap-stations-in-denmark-by-s/#aol-comments
-	-	It's about an 8 hour job to "swap" the batteries out of Tesla.  In order to get enough battery power in a car to make it useful, you have to stuff them in a lot of places.  That scheme does work well for things like golf carts and city run abouts, but batteries just aren't small enough yet for road cars.
-	-	Mitsubishi are working on this. An automated battery changer that takes about 3 minutes.
-	-	&gt; 100 miles is plenty? What if I don't fit into the typical use case?  Then you're an edge case and the product isn't designed around you. Get over it.  Hell, if you live in a city you can get a Zipcar for your 300 mile day.

-	-	You aren't typical. Most people drive to and from work... And to and from a shopping area. The "average" person has never been to a conference. The "average" person does not need 300 horsepower and 400 mile range.
-	-	Just wondering why some people never cut the cord
-	-	The point is: Some of the country IS like me, so the statement that it's provided by coal isn't strictly true.     Actually every single electric car owner that I personally know IS like me.  (4 Teslas, 1 RAV4 EV, 2 Converted Mini Coopers, 1 Leaf, and 1 Volt(*), 2 Plugin Converted Prius') While the sample size is small, and we tend to be environmentally conscious vote with your wallet types, it's trending toward the exact opposite of what you say.
-	-	The way electricity companies work is they have a bunch of plants which are on all the time, and some "peak-only" plants which are on only during peak hours.  To generate more electricity off-peak, which the vast majority of cars would charge during, all they need to do is turn on their peak-only plans during off-peak hours.  We already have enough spare capacity for tens of millions of electric cars.  Of course it will cost money, but it will cost less to run electric cars than to run gas cars, and the energy can be generated here, instead of relying on foreign sources.
-	-	All the batteries ever made could hold enough electricity to power the planet for a few seconds. Our battery technology is certainly lagging, but  more advanced wireless electric technology or electric cables(like what buses use) are alternatives to batteries. However, we still need to develop batteries to deal with night time, dry seasons, and lacking wind.  
-	-	There are also other factors to consider. Such as the cost of maintenance. Maintenance in an electric is almost non existent. 
-	-	A performance, luxury sedan.
-	-	&gt;toe the line    ftfy
-	-	I do it too. While I know I am a non-norm man, I don't understand why no one else is doing it.  I live in the city, so I have a very small personal car for running errands and driving to friends and family that are less than 100km away. Anything more and I get a rental. Just what I save on gas, insurance and taxes (the Netherlands so all these are very high) make up more than enough for the extra cost of the occasional rental.
0	2	I've done it.  My best memory was when my in-town-driving-back-and-forth-to-work car was dull and not in great shape.  I rented a convertible to drive 3 hours and back.  It was AWESOME.  You seriously don't need to compromise the car you drive every day to allow for the occasional road trip.  Obviously, if you're a traveling salesman, the joke is on you.
-	-	&gt; It's mostly because diesels operate at a higher compression ratio and are inherently more efficient than Otto-cycle gasoline engines.  Diesel also has higher energy density than gasoline.
-	-	There's also the performance of electric cars, though the top speed is average, the acceleration is way above par. The Tesla does 0-60mph in 3.9s. The Leaf does it in 9.9s. Electric motors keep their full torque on right up to the high speeds as the power increases, whereas an IC engine will need to use a higher gear on the same amount of power, therefore accelerating slower.  Also, if you buy an electric car in the Netherlands, the council will put a charging post on your street. Takes the sting out of the currently high purchase price.   
1	4	Very cool.  I can imagine a car or battery manufacturer subleasing space at gas stations, malls, grocery stores, etc, to install swap stations and that other manufacturers will be compelled to standardize.  AAA could offer swap service, they send out a truck to you that can do the swap.
-	-	Yes, but isn't the idea behind battery advances to get **everybody** off of petrol?
1	4	You could call this 'fuel' gasoline.   I kid, I kid.
1	7	&gt;getting everyone to agree on a standard battery is practically impossible  I'm looking at you GM!
-	-	Run a 500m extension cable from your car to your 20th floor apartment. Problem solved.
-	-	Hydrogen fuel cells?
-	-	I seem to remember an article that figured in the cost of the car, maintenance, and inpact on the environment (along with the MPG rating).  I believe they placed the Jetta TDI above the Prius, however the #1 spot actually went to the hatchback Yaris.
0	5	As a happy TDI owner I approve this message, noting an exception on the use of biofuels in 2009+ models.  The new clean diesel standards introduced more sensitive emission controls that don't bode well to using biodiesel or waste veggie oil although there are some additives that say they help with biodiesel.  I'm still skeptical now.
1	4	You and that site just got trolled. Obviously an M3 isn't as fuel efficient. It's TOP GEAR, for crying out loud.
-	-	&gt;"It was one of the dullest drives of my life, but in the interest of science I stuck with it," Clarkson said. "Seriously, what I'm saying is, it isn't what you drive that matters, it's how you drive it. That is everything."  I think treehugger missed the point.
1	7	Since graphene itself is so new this is truly a breakthrough as a result of another breakthrough.. sciiiience!
-	-	My crappy 2000 Jetta bought secondhand in 2005 is still running decently. 160,000 miles and counting.
-	-	You sacrifice handling though due to the extra weight of the batteries.

-	-	I guess that's why everywhere I look I see people driving old VW golfs.
1	4	Agreed. I would buy a TDI-type car if any other car maker built one. But not VW. Hell. NO.
0	5	It sounds like an electric car is just not going to work for you.  But someone in a different situation might like to own a virtually maintenance free car as a 2nd vehicle for the family, or as the daily commuter car, or a car for the kid.  That should make a lot of sense to people.  Someday we might get everybody off gasoline, but that's not going to happen anytime soon.  We need to take baby steps, and right now we've almost just started to begin to crawl.  I don't know where this idea that we're going to switch everybody to electric is coming from, but it's not from the electric car community.  I don't think it's going to be possible to wean everything off fossil fuel in my lifetime, some modes of transportation are just to energy intensive for any foreseeable battery technology to handle.  The only electric car you can really purchase today is the leaf, and it costs too much to fill one of those roles I mentioned above.  However, as a mass produced, mass marketed, name-brand electric car that you can actually go out and buy (almost), it is the first of it's kind in the modern era.  So I would expect the costs to quickly come down once the car has competition in the marketplace.
-	-	I think if we reduced by 95% that would be total success.  There's always biodiesel for minor needs (or supplemental/hybrid engines for those that need it)
-	-	Have you ever seen a grown man naked?
-	-	Which is funny because "America was built on innovation and small business." It's a bit hard to start a small EV business in your garage when battery makers won't even respond to your emails unless your interested in doing $$,$$$,$$$ worth of business.  Which of course means we have to order from China.

-	-	Neither Li batteries or gasoline explode in common hazard situations. Gasoline is particularly dangerous because:  1. It evaporates at normal temperatures.  2. This vapor is heavy and travels along the ground.  3. As a result the vapor tends to find a source of ignition such as a pilot light.  4. The flame then propagates very quickly back to the source of the leak.   This effect is why insurance companies charge a premium for attached garages. A building with gasoline in it is significantly more likely to catch fire.  A car with a leaking fuel line will often just burn up. Most people have seen at least one car on fire in their lifetime. I have seem 3 so far.  So anyway, as things go, gasoline is a pretty dangerous material. This makes discussions of relative risks a bit strange. Saying something is safer than gasoline is not saying much. 
1	4	Lithium battery fires are related to Lithium Cobalt batteries, not the types of batteries (Lithium Manganese, or Lithium Iron) commonly used in EVs.  Lithium Cobalts are dangerous because they release their own oxygen while burning.  No other battery I know of does this.  A lithium Iron battery can be punctured, and not only fail to ignite, but still go on producing current.  &gt;Gasoline is designed to be stable and burn at a relatively low temperature. To make it explode requires a very specific set of conditions  Same with battery vehicles.  Except they are far, far less likely to burn or explode than a gasoline powered car.  &gt;Gasoline burns at ~560 degrees C. Lithium at ~2,500 degrees C.  There is no elemental lithium in EV batteries.  The lithium in a battery is as harmless as the sodium in table salt.         
1	4	&gt; It's been at **most** a month since I've read about another breakthrough battery technology.
-	-	You don't get a charge when a new one trickles in?
-	-	There is also another cure for cancer every single week as well, sad thing is that these breakthroughs seem to never go anywhere. 
-	-	Every time there is a post about batteries I have to deal with a bunch of ignorant shit in the comments and as someone who studies this stuff for 8 hours a day it really bugs me. Before you post, why don't you stop and read up on it.   There are important break throughs all the damn time in battery tech. Just because they aren't the holy grail and render gasoline obsolete overnight doesn't mean they're not important. So save me your mis-placed disbelief. Some of us are trying to learn here.
-	-	Illuminati mus be slippin B
0	5	Science is hard :(
-	-	Yeah, where's the hope crushing comment already?
-	-	Gasoline contains 47.2 megajoules per kilogram. A lithium battery? 0.72 per kilogram.  If this gets use closer to even, say, *five*, electric cars will be **far** more effective and practical to own.  Fortunately there's a few initiatives to make this happen. Aside from Lithium-Sulfur batteries, there's also Lithium-Nanowire. Toshiba also has a regular [Lithium-Ion battery](http://www.toshiba.com/ind/product_display.jsp?id1=821) that's supposed to be good for upwards of 6000 charging cycles, which would definitely be useful in this application, to the very least, for plug-in hybrids.
1	4	My favorite thing is to read about something in /science and then read about it as a product several years later (I lurked a long time before making an account) in /technology.
0	2	I know people are cynical, but technologyreview is a serious source, and the amount of basic research being done is phenomenal.    People were mocking solar tech for a long time (and still do), but we now have wholesale thin-film cells for under $1.00 per peak watt (some say $0.35 production cost), and Joe Sixpack can buy silicon panels for less than $2.00 per watt, when a few years ago it was $5.00 and a dollar was worth considerably more.  Stuff like this is the future, even if you can't buy it right now.
-	-	I know some smaller battery companies have been using their products in electric cars for years now.
0	2	Except that those long distances are still not long enough for mass consumer acceptance.  Donno where they got the info about current capability though. Lithium based cells have a tendency to be damn impressive in that regard.
-	-	You can't compare it that way. You must consider thermodynamic quality of energy.  Gasoline contains 47.2mJ/kg of *thermal energy*, but the crappy ICEs in cars only convert about 15% of that to useful work. The rest is released as waste heat via the radiator and tailpipe. So gasoline only *really* contains about 7.08mJ/kg of useful work when used in a standard car engine.  Electricity to mechanical work is a very efficient conversion: &gt;90%, can be as high as 98% with certain motor technologies. That's because electricity is already low-entropy, while heat is high-entropy energy.  Still better than Li-Ion, but the margin shrinks by orders of magnitude when you consider thermodynamics.  Then cut all the weight associated with the big heavy metal internal combustion engine. Then add regenerative braking. 
-	-	That's a chemical engineering problem. I'm sure we've got some of them round here somewhere...
-	-	My electric car gets over 100 miles on the same amount of energy as one gallon of gasoline.  There are literally zero cars available in America which even get half that.
-	-	Your argument got owned by the Carnot cycle. 
-	-	Electric cars are utterly impractical for long distance driving, for now. But for the needs of 99%, 99% of the time? The distance is already sufficient and an electric plug is all you need for charging your car while at work and/or overnight. No one is asking you to stand outside, down the street, and next to the pump for 8 hours.
1	4	http://www.teslamotors.com/models/specs. 300 miles available in 2012. You're welcome.
0	1	Yes.. upvote the guy who completely takes random statistics out of his ass.
-	-	They've been in mass production for a few years now. 
-	-	Chances are, you have used them, most likely unknowingly. For example nano particles of TiO2 are rather commonly used in things like paints and sunscreens. 
-	-	http://bigthink.com/ideas/24381  "The **theory** behind the substance graphene was first explored by theoretical physicist Philip Wallace in **1947** as kind of a starting point when he was doing research trying to understand the electronic properties of more complex, 3D graphite. although **the name graphene wasn't actually coined until 40 years later**, where it **was used to describe single sheets of graphite**. In other words, it's the name given to a flat monolayer of carbon atoms that are tightly packed into a 2D honeycomb lattice; like a molecular chicken-wire that is one atom thick. It's essentially the basic building block for graphitic materials of all other dimensionalities; it's a stepping stone to building bigger things. **Graphene in itself however wasn't discovered until 2004 in its full observable and testable form.** "  The theory, and word used to describe it was around... but it wasn't.
-	-	Yes... Genera Ree, I am
1	4	A lot of the time with emerging technology, the high end market will be targeted first; The producers can get away with charging out the nose, giving them more money to play with and develop the technology further, eventually allowing them to create a product for the middle class while still making a profit. The way I see it, the Tesla and similar EV's are not aimed at the average consumer, but should hopefully accrue enough global interest in the EV concept that more manufacturers and financial backers jump into the market, creating more competition, and hence better products at lower prices. That is my hope anyway, and I am really excited about the future ;).
-	-	There's no way I can afford to buy an electric car though. I'm driving an 11 year old gasoline powered sedan with 250,000+ miles. If gas were to increase by a dollar per year I would have to choose between seeing my family or going to school. Just let petroleum run out and society will still be forced to make those sort of necessary changes at a slower pace.
-	-	Yes it **should**.
-	-	"Fuel efficient" should be taken, in this context, to mean "energy efficient as it relates to converted MPG".
1	4	&gt;On average, can you agree that at the moment, the entire process of electric car vs petrol car is about the same in terms of energy efficiency?  It's not.  Electric cars have much higher well-to-wheel efficiency.  Here's one discussion on it, there are others elsewhere http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster#Energy_efficiency  Everything else, of course, you're right about.
0	5	&gt;renewables and fission are not our future sources for energy  They should be, but.. Ahem. Little progress being genuinely made on that front. In fact, we seem to be going backwards. It reads to me a bit like a child saying: "Why can't everything be solar-powered!?"  &gt;And switching to renewables and fission will not happen within 10 years?  I sense I may be a little older than you, but categorically: NO.  Depressing, isn't it?
-	-	Yes....yes it does. You know petrol is burned to make electricity. So is coal. This is really common during peak loading times. Electricity isn't *that* clean.
-	-	Bigger batteries mean longer life cycles. 10 years for the battery on a Model S is realistic.
-	-	&gt; What if...   Parent was referring to the fact that tesla does license its tech to other car companies...
1	8	I'd love one. 'cept I'm not a home owner. I have no means to recharge it.
-	-	Why hasn't it happened?
0	2	Not sure if I follow. 2500 x 10 = 25,000. Assuming you drove the same car for 10 years (many do not) and spent $20k on it (average working class), you're still $25,000 below the PURCHASE price of a Tesla, so you'd still be losing $25,000 just by purchasing the car. That's not including the cost to recharge it for 10 years and put a new battery in after 5. (Which is very expensive).  Have a $30k car? You're still under 15k. Have a $40k car? You're still under 5k.   If you're spending 45k on a car, you're not the average driver.  
-	-	Indeed. I'm not arguing against it at all its purely a curiosity thing.  Eventually we'll need a better option. 
-	-	I wonder if anyone has priced out the amount of power that would be consumed by our nations 250 million+ registered automobiles, daily for 8 hours. I know power consumption will go down, wind/solar/etc will increase, but that's over a billion hours of consumption daily.   Electric companies might be the new big oil, they should be developing the battery tech. 
1	4	That's awesome. Most of the country isn't you. 
-	-	why does it matter?
-	-	that's my business. I also travel regularly for conferences and academic purposes. air fare is can be prohibitively expensive. Batteries just can't replace the utility of ICE- yet. I really hope they can ASAP though.
-	-	You get a rental for road trips? You are a non norm case man.
-	-	&gt;The best you could do is swap out the whole battery pack  There have been people with that idea, who have actually started implementing it in Israel http://www.cnet.com.au/electric-car-battery-swap-station-trial-in-japan-339296437.htm . I think this is a great idea, but I am afraid they are rushing into it a bit. The problem is that a standard needs to be easy to implement in any design, robust, cheap, and most of all stand the test of time. But if we can develop a battery swapping system like this, it could really accelerate (sorry) the migration to electric vehicles.
-	-	The model S is comparable in performance and features to a high end A6 or BMW 5 series, not a Corolla.
-	-	The LCD monitor you're probably looking at was technically possible for a long time but not economically feasible for the common user until relatively recently.  The people who buy the Model S at $70,000 are directly funding future mass production. 
-	-	&gt; They're not feasible for the common driver.  Yet.
0	1	To get off gas completely and rely upon electricity that predominantly comes from coal burning plants will simply move the pollution producing mechanism out of the end-users sight.  Sure the cars themselves will become zero emission units, however, the coal burning power plant producing the electricity will be belching nasty emissions at unprecedented rates.  Presently, the single worst source of air pollution is coal burning power plants, http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c01.html.  Making all cars electric will simply transfer the pollution to somewhere the end-user doesn't see ... poof magic, pollution is gone, not so, unfortunately.  This is one very common effect at the science-layman(enduser) interface.  The illusion of clean technology gets the layman geeked, however, the scientists know that these technologies do not necessarily reduce overall net pollution, and in most cases can increase the net pollution.    
-	-	...When the Prius was being driven at top speed around their racetrack and the M3 was just following.  If you had even listened to what they said in that episode, they flat out stated that the M3 is obviously not a fuel efficient car. Rather, they wanted to point out that accelerating slowly, keeping at the speed limit, and avoiding unnecessary braking is very important to fuel economy, often moreso then selling your current car for a hybrid or smaller car with fewer features.
-	-	The fine print should include the links to debunkings of this show, such as [this one](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/07/top-gear-prius-hybrid-bmw-m3-video-wrong.php). Honestly, the idea that a sports car tuned for acceleration and top-end speed could actually compete with an econobox on fuel economy is ludicrous. Only by being seriously disingenuous could that comparison have been made.
1	4	Sounds pretty darned good.
-	-	As I mentioned in another post:  "Yes, but isn't the idea behind battery advances to get **everybody** off of petrol?"
-	-	except the part where its made by VW and will break down 1000 miles past warranty. and it will break HARD.
0	2	I'm a big fan of the *idea* of the TDI. I just refuse to buy VWs since our Jetta crapped out at 85,000 miles. Talk about inefficient. This is an aspect of efficiency that is rarely considered. How efficient would a Prius be that only lasted, say, 40,000 miles before needing to be replaced?
-	-	The Tesla has been on the road for years and has a 240 mile range.
-	-	I think those recharging stations are in a chicken and egg situation.  We'll need to have an established base of electric vehicles before people (gas stations) will start installing fast recharging stations.  It's good that people are talking about them now because now is the time to set standards that car manufactures can adhere to.  But I think that the for first million electric vehicles sold, recharging stations will be few and far between and that that aspect of electric vehicles should be ignored in the marketing.  Once there is an established base of electric cars on the roads, all sorts of recharging business and locations will erupt out of the ether.  The technology for it exists today, the trick for us now is simply getting that established base of cars out there.  That's where the car companies should focus their marketing efforts, on getting practical electric cars into the hands of consumers.
-	-	Electric vehicles have very high efficiency. Often in excess of 80-90%.  Ice engines rarely get 35% efficiency. Additionally, its possible to get clean, renewable sources if electricity even if most of it comes from coal right now, it's changing.
0	2	Have you ever seen gasoline explode?  We already deal with inherent dangers in our vehicles, a burning battery isn't much worse.
-	-	Heheh. Wang.
-	-	Wat?  I've seen it...wireless battery charging for one.  I'm hung over or I'd bother to offer a rebuttal to your cynical attitude.
1	4	That's another good one!  Yeah!
0	1	Aren't you a cunt.
-	-	How much money do you have?   http://moller.com/
-	-	The Tesla Roadster is supposed to have phenomenal performance, and Tesla is claiming that the Model S will as well.
-	-	Me too; trouble is, I live in the city, and park (parallel) on the street. No way to charge...
1	4	It would be perfect if the batteries were smaller. The actual motor in an EV is tiny compared to a petrol engine, there's usually little in the way of gears, no turbo, no exhaust or any of that stuff. The space is all taken up by battery. In the Tesla it weighs ~600kg. Plus, the battery gets hot when it discharges and needs a cooling system and that would make them more difficult to change. I wonder if it would be possible to fill the battery with a liquid "fuel" that can be drained and recharged. That would work nicely if the clever chemistry came about.
-	-	&gt; Especcialy since I don't drive fast.  The tesla outperforms porsches...
-	-	Yep, becuase every day I drive 300-400 miles to work.
-	-	another word, "don't live in an apartment building without a garage and dedicated power plug for your parking space."
0	2	Such as:  * replacing the battery every 5 years (by the way, that'll be $12,000) * tires (yes still needed) * coolant (yes the Tesla has coolant) * brakes * $30/month for electricity  There isn't as much maintenance, but there is still plenty of it, and some of it is VERY costly.    Understand that I'm not against Tesla, I wish I could have one, but, its a bit silly to think they're saving us or ever will. 
-	-	At 50k-70k it is competitive with only Cadillac, BMW, Lexus, etc,  so I would agree.  Which is why I replied in the first place, [he was saying it was available in 2012 in response to a comment about a "typical" car](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ih4em/sulphur_breakthrough_significantly_boosts_lithium/c23qojg).  Which it clearly is not. Nor it is something that can be mass produced at this time. Thanks for agreement. 
-	-	"Long distances" means somewhere around 100 miles for consumer electric cars, but that's with a battery that makes the car significantly more expensive than the gasoline alternative and that is heavy and very large.  For example, the Chevy Volt's battery takes up the middle of the rear seat, making it a four-seat-only car. If you want to use electric power to its full advantages, you need a cheaper, lighter, smaller battery system.
-	-	What's the recharge time?
1	4	Thats awesome- could you link some info on that?
-	-	Plus electric motors are way more efficient than internal combustion engines so they need/use less energy. 
-	-	Then another problem would be evident: how do you charge the car's battery?  Without a huge restructuring of all the electric grid, there's no way to recharge car batteries as quickly as you fill a tank of gasoline because the infrastructure to deliver that much power to the refilling stations does not exist.  Electric cars at first, when they become common, will be recharged slowly when they are parked, not in a few minutes like gasoline or diesel cars. Either that or have replaceable batteries, which would introduce a whole set of new problems. 
-	-	And I tested them as a student researcher and will be testing them further as a grad student. Thank you for injecting some rationality into this. As someone who works with batteries, this sub makes me want to puke blood sometimes.   BTW, keep up the good work, I like the new green shrink wrap on the 26-650s, its a lot nicer than that white cardboard.
-	-	I've got it in my head that the average US commuter drives 30-40 miles per day.  We need to convince most of those folks (myself included) to switch to electric.  Most people wouldn't want a car that gets 400 miles on a charge.  It would take days to charge that sucker back up in the garage.  I think a 100 mile, real-world driving distance would be more than adequate for most people.  That would be enough charge to allow the average commuter to forget to plug the car in every once in a while when they get home at night.  You plug your car in at night and you can go 100 miles the next day.  Electric cars need to be marketed to college kids, daily commuters, and as a family's 2nd car, especially at first.  The cars need to be inexpensive and "normal" looking.  Current Lithium battery technology is capable of achieving 100 miles today, but barely.  As I see it, the main advantage of increasing charge capacity over current battery technology is not necessarily in achieving greater driving range, it is in reducing the number of cells required in a car and thus reducing the cost.
-	-	And of course it won't ever make it to cars because there's too much money in greedy big oil companies :\ really makes you mad doesn't it?
-	-	[deleted]
-	-	Don't you love those science breakthrough article titles with 'could' in it?
-	-	How do you mass produce that?

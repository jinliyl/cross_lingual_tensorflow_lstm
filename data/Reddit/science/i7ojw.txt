-	-	Alternatively, manufacture cheap, tasty calories. Market well.  Profit.  Invest profit in shares of Eli Lilly.  Profit again.  
-	-	&gt; Unfortunately, a diet high in fat is also usually high in carbohydrates, because in most processed foods they go hand in hand.  Well, just don't eat processed foods and you're set. Raw nuts, avocados, oils have extraordinarily healthy fats with no carbs.
-	-	&gt; Type 2 diabetes is practically cured by a high fat low carb diet.  So? A headache can be cured by an aspirin tablet. That doesn't mean headaches are caused by lack of aspirin. Just because something cures a disease doesn't mean it's directly related to the cause.  &gt; If you have 90 min, watch that video.  If that video represents a scientific study, I'm sure you can instead link me to the actual papers involved?  &gt;Also, a diet high in fat is actually less effective at making you fat.  That is true according to the latest studies I've seen, but that could simply be because high-fat foods cause satiety, whereas high-carb foods don't. There's no reason to think the body is less efficient at harnessing energy from high-fat diets (in fact it isn't).  Again, all these points you make are mainly just 'folk science', repeated and re-repeated by the media, with little or no actual science to back them up.
0	5	Ack, sorry, deleted the wrong one of the double posts. The other is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/i7ojw/type_2_diabetes_in_newly_diagnosed_can_be/c21muuw) to restore the link.  Ah yes, you're right, that statement is too categorical. He's talking, I suppose, about reversing the recent increase. I couldn't find data for the UK, but diabetes in America has increased [two-fold since 1980](http://www.berkeleycitizen.org/image/diabetes2.jpg).
-	-	&gt;Nutritionally, you're probably better off with a diet high in natural fats than a diet high in processed carbs.  Very true. The ratio of carbs/fats/proteins is very important as well, and your intake of carbs should make up the smallest of the 3.
-	-	I agree with most of your statement, but what is the evidence for claiming that poultry fat is healthy?   Compared to fat from pigs or cows, fat from poultry has an exceedingly high omega-6 fat content, around 6x that of tallow (beef fat) and 2x that of lard (pork fat). 
0	1	Processed fats and carbohydrates in excess will cause you to gain weight, but in moderate amounts- not necessarily.  Where is there evidence about poultry fat being very healthy?  I do agree with everything else though. 
-	-	Insulin resistance IS diabetes (type 2 at least).
-	-	http://www.amazon.com/Slim-Fast-Low-Carb-Chocolate-11-Ounce-4-Count/dp/B000J3MU9C This is what I was referring to. It is something less than 200 calories/serving, and 2g carbs/serving. I keep a couple in the fridge for mornings I don't have time to grab anything healthier for breakfast.  Edit: Just to satisfy my own curiosity, I looked up the nutrition facts for both the low carb slimfast and ready to drink regular and light muscle milk. They are fairly similar. The low carb slimfast actually has less sugar and fat but more dietary fiber than regular muscle milk. The sugar comparison is the same vs the light muscle milk, but the light muscle milk has less fat (5g vs 9g for the slimfast). http://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/slim-fast/low-carb-creamy-chocolate-shake http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-muscle-milk-ready-drink-i121266 http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-muscle-milk-light-ready-drink-i121268

0	1	&gt; "We have known that starvation is a good cure for diabetes. If we introduced rationing tomorrow, then we could get rid of diabetes in this country."  The last sentence is a bit surprising to me. You're not safe from diabetes just because you're underweight, are you?
-	-	Press release: http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press.office/press.release/item/diet-reverses-type-2-diabetes  Study: http://www.diabetologia-journal.org/#inside_this_issue (under the "In the news" section) or on the publisher's site in PDF and HTML format - http://www.springerlink.com/content/68rmr50h7j024525/
1	6	that is really interesting.
1	6	So the diet is "liquid diet drinks and non-starchy vegetables"? What does that mean, protein shakes and salads?
0	1	Even more evidence against the "OMG sugar in our food is causing diabetes" camp. It's not sugar, it's excess body fat. Diabetes rates are increasing because we're getting fatter. Of course, eating sugar can help you gain weight, no doubt about it. However, a diet high in fat can do that too, and perhaps more effectively.  EDIT: Wow, I get down-voted every time I say this, and I have no idea why. Please inform me as to the root cause.
-	-	more likely reduced calorie slim-fast and celery.
-	-	It seems that is basically true. The only lifestyle risk factor this [NHS page on diabetes](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Diabetes/Pages/Avoiddiabetes.aspx) mentions is body weight, and more specifically body fat around the waist. This is also what I was told recently by a professor of hepatology. They said that large amounts of fat near the liver and the pancreas leads to the build-up of fatty deposits in the organs themselves, which then disrupts their ability to function properly.
0	1	Were I to downvote you, it would be because you don't seem to understand nutrition very well.  Processed fats and carbs will cause you to gain weight.  Unprocessed fats are actually very healthy, poultry fat in particular.  Something that is labeled low fat often has a lot of processed carbs, nor are carbohydrates satiating like fat, so you eat more.  Not that I think carbs should be demonized either, but I think it's time to bury the myth that fat is bad for you.  Nutritionally, you're probably better off with a diet high in natural fats than a diet high in processed carbs.
-	-	&gt; It's not sugar, it's excess body fat.  The anti-sugar front claims that excess body fat is caused by excess sugar.
-	-	If your interest is in nutrition, then I would really go look at that cookbook [Fat](http://www.amazon.com/Fat-Appreciation-Misunderstood-Ingredient-Recipes/dp/1580089356/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1309264027&amp;sr=8-1) I mentioned previously.  The woman who wrote it did a lot of research, so much so that it is probably a good replacement for a review paper.  I'm certain she has references in there as well.  To be honest, anymore I deal strictly with genetics, and generally only a single method for assessing them (Sequenom, then Illumina).  At this point, I'm just processing samples for customers without any larger idea of what their study is.  I do find the enteric nervous system to be fascinating though, as at my last job, that is what we studied.  You may want to keep an ear out for studies on methylation, as they're discovering a lot of crazy shit, like grandchildren of people who survived famines live longer.  I'm sorry I can't cite the study; it was mentioned at a conference I went to.  It's an interesting area of study though.
-	-	youre most likely being downvoted because being fat doesnt cause diabetes, it's a risk factor, there's an obvious correlation but its not a cause of insulin insensitivty 
-	-	You should really research insulin resistance, its causes, and its role in weight gain.
-	-	"A diet high in fat"  Unfortunately, a diet high in fat is also usually high in carbohydrates, because in most processed foods they go hand in hand. If you eat burgers at a fast food joint, your diet is extremely high in both fats and carbs. Fats and proteins don't spike your blood glucose, carbs do.   You can eat a diet high in fat and protein, with very little carbs and be very healthy (think Atkins style). Take that same amount of fats and proteins and toss in a typical persons 300+ grams a day of carbs, and suddenly you're on a death march.  As a diabetic, I personally don't worry about fats. Huge plate of buffalo wings? Bring 'em on! I simply try to limit myself to 100g or less of carbs per day, and then the carbs I do eat I like to be the fruit I snack on, plus a cookie now and then to satisfy my sweet tooth. I try to not eat bread, rice or any form of potatoes. Keeps my glucose numbers where they need to be, and all my other bloodwork looks like that of a teenager.
-	-	TLDR: Eat moderately. Stay in shape. Profit.
-	-	[Sugar is the reason.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM)  If you have 90 min, watch that video. I also highly recommend watching the movie FatHead (it's on netflix instant stream). Both explain pretty much why sugar and carbs (since carbs are sugar as far as the body is concerned), are causing the obesity and diabetes in america.  Type 2 diabetes is practically cured by a high fat low carb diet. It's carbs and sugar that spike the blood sugar, and cause the insulin rush in your body. People with type 2 diabetes can't use or regulate their insulin levels properly. Also the more sugar and carbs you ingest, the more resistant and tolerant your body becomes to insulin. This causes your body to produce more insulin when your blood sugar is high (eventually causing type 2 diabetes).  Insulin has two jobs it does in your body. The first is to break down your blood sugar into fat that your body can use for energy. The second is, it stores the fat in your body into fat cells. When you have so much insulin in your body due to a high blood sugar spike, the insulin stays around and actually keeps your fat cells from releasing the stored fat, this prevents your body from getting the energy it needs. This causes your body and brain to tell you that it needs more food, so you eat even though your have ample stores of energy in fatcells. We end up eating things that are high in carbs and sugars (because that's what the government recommends), causing the cycle to continue.  Also, a diet high in fat is actually less effective at making you fat. Insulin is the hormone in your body that manages and stores fat, and eating fat doesn't spike the blood sugar or cause a rise in insulin in your body. This is why the 'atkins diet' was effective. A ketogenic diet, such as the atkins diet, does it's job by not eating the things which spike blood sugar and insulin levels.
-	-	I don't know if sugar help type 2 diabete but it make me eat more because I will eat anything that is coated with sugar easily whereas if it's not I will get bored faster and don't bother eating as much.
-	-	That page also mentions that weight doesn't affect the risk for developing type 1 diabetes at all, so the quote can clearly not be taken *literally* anyhow.   I still doubt it's *100%* true for type 2 either, though clearly being overweight is a big risk factor. That part appears to be quite clear!
-	-	Yeah, a relative of mine is a liver specialist, and they've told me the same thing. It's strange and probably damaging that the public perception is that there is a direct link between sugar and diabetes. Keep up the good work.  Edit: Reading briefly about insulin resistance, as suggested by DrMoreau69, suggests this is complicated:  *"It is well known that insulin resistance commonly coexists with obesity. However, causal links between insulin resistance, obesity, and dietary factors are complex and controversial. It is possible that one of them arises first, and tends to cause the other; or that insulin resistance and excess body weight might arise independently as a consequence of a third factor, but end up reinforcing each other."*  Even so, the dietary factors seem to be as much if not more about excessive fat intake as sugar.
1	6	So I'm safe to eat excess bacon? MMMMMmmmmmm bacon.
-	-	[And slimfast is pretty much sugar in a can.](http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-slim-fast-i57484)  Better off with protein powder or something like muscle milk.  Never understood the whole slimfast thing.  (Not sure what reduced calorie slimfast is though, they do have a reduced carb that is better, but still not as good as muscle milk or protein shakes.)
-	-	I think the argument is that fat intake doesn't cause insulin resistance where sugars do.  Keto diets seem to make it fairly obvious that fat intake doesn't have as much of an effect on glucose/insulin levels.  I'm just stating what I heard.  I don't care enough to pick a side in that debate.  It seems like type 1 and 2 are so different that people need to stop grouping them as the same disease.
-	-	Poke around for "French Paradox" and also chicken soup.  There's a cookbook called Fat that goes into much more detail.
1	6	I like to read peer-reviewed journal articles in parts of my spare time and much of my assignments in undergrad (as a nutrition major) were based on peer-reviewed research rather than ordinary websites.  I certainly agree though that the jargon is difficult to understand when approaching new territory.  Research methodology and study designs not to mention the biases and confounding are what make or break some studies.  I learned about them in my epidemiology in public health class, it really only covered the surface.  A PhD student would be better versed in study design and critiquing individual studies.    Some of the books I have read whether on sports nutrition, Alan Aragon's "Girth Control," and "The China Study" have always opened with explanations on various study designs- so it seems knowing their strengths and weaknesses is vital in interpreting research.   Some examples are descriptive vs. analytical vs. experimental or research reviews &amp; meta-analyses.  I think before trying to delve into peer-reviewed research it's important to get a good foothold of study designs so you know the general outline of how the study was conducted.  The best peer-reviewed journal for nutrition research would have to be the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition- I just can't love it enough.  Check it out if you have access. 
-	-	Not to be dick, but what is your experience with reading peer-reviewed journal articles? I find I need to read a few general reviews of the topic before I'm able to understand enough about it to know what it is I am looking for, as simply typing "French paradox" into Pubmed gives a bevy of responses. I find the jargon to be the most difficult part of science, as each area of research, each methodology, has it's own set. I get the impression quite often that people know what these articles are, but have never spent a lot of time searching through them and reading them.
0	1	I have heard about the "French Paradox", but do you know of any peer-reviewed journal articles that support the healthfulness of poultry fats? 
1	4	Yea that is a lot better.   Probably cheaper than muscle milk as well.
-	-	&gt; So? A headache can be cured by an aspirin tablet. That doesn't mean headaches are caused by lack of aspirin. Just because something cures a disease doesn't mean it's directly related to the cause.  Correct, but one key difference between a high carb diet, and a high fat diet is blood sugar spikes and insulin levels. Carbs spike the blood sugar (much more than fat), causing your body to produce a spike in insulin. This causes your body to build up a resistance to insulin, eventually leading to type 2 diabetes. That is the correlation I was going with.  &gt; If that video represents a scientific study, I'm sure you can instead link me to the actual papers involved?  [I couldn't find a link to any of the sources of my original link; However, he does go into the biochemistry of fructose at around 53 min.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM#t=52m55s) If you want to disprove his speech, that would be the place to do it at.  &gt; That is true according to the latest studies I've seen, but that could simply be because high-fat foods cause satiety, whereas high-carb foods don't. There's no reason to think the body is less efficient at harnessing energy from high-fat diets (in fact it isn't).  That extra satiety comes from the lower insulin levels. [Excess insulin in your system causes your fat cells to not release the energy for your body to use.](http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/83/6/1911.full) When your body doesn't get the energy it wants, it tells your brain to eat.  &gt; Again, all these points you make are mainly just 'folk science', repeated and re-repeated by the media, with little or no actual science to back them up.  It would be nice if all presented information was coupled with scientific studies that were easy to find at a quick glance, but alas that's not always the case. Misinformation is a terrible thing, but I pass along the original link because it agrees with other lectures and arguments I've seen pertaining to the subject, and because he actually showed the biochemistry. To me, I think the information is solid and worth viewing.   &gt; Again, all these points you make are mainly just 'folk science', repeated and re-repeated by the media, with little or no actual science to back them up.  &gt; Even more evidence against the "OMG sugar in our food is causing diabetes" camp. It's not sugar, it's excess body fat. Diabetes rates are increasing because we're getting fatter. Of course, eating sugar can help you gain weight, no doubt about it. However, a diet high in fat can do that too, and perhaps more effectively.  Monkey see monkey do :P
1	4	I agree, I try to not eat anything that comes in a box or wrapper, except my Special K protein cereal.   Love nuts, although things like peanuts and sunflower seeds do have carbs.

0	5	[The Curiosity Lander](http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/07/features/rover-returns), via Wired. Sorry, it *is* a slideshow, but it's only 6-images long and it's relatively non-intrusive (and decently high res).      **EDIT:** Here's the slideshow, minus the slideshow:      [First Image](http://i.imgur.com/rFf0y.jpg): The three-metre, 890kg 1 rover is powered by a radioisotope generator. The decay of 4.8kg of plutonium dioxide will provide a steady source of heat, used to produce onboard electricity. This means the rover can continue its mission at night, unlike earlier solar-powered craft, whose panels could be obscured by Martian dust.      [Second Image](http://i.imgur.com/gC2rj.jpg): Spacecraft built in the Jet Propulsion Lab at Pasadena have observed the Moon, Venus, Mars, I Jupiter, Saturn and the outer solar system. Here, technicians work on the Mars Science Laboratory’s flight system in a clean room. Two thousand technicians and scientists have worked on the project over the past six years.      [Fourth Image](http://i.imgur.com/AxIHa.jpg): Earlier rovers bounced on to the surface of Mars using air bags. Curiosity is too heavy for that, so will use a jet backpack for the final part of its descent. As the retro rockets control the landing speed, the descent stage will unspool tethers to lower the rover’s wheels on to the surface. “If it works, it will be spectacular,” says Grotzinger.      [Fifth Image](http://i.imgur.com/bxQFQ.jpg): Errin Dalshaug, left, and 5 Brett Kennedy, of JPL, prepare to assess vibration in a test model of the robotic arm. It will wield a drill, a magnifying lens camera, an element-identifying spectrometer and a rock brush. “This arm is strong,” says Kennedy, “but still needs to move accurately enough to drop an aspirin into a thimble.”      [Sixth Image](http://i.imgur.com/X16CP.jpg): The backshell forms the top portion of the capsule that will enclose the rover and descent stage to protect them from the heat of falling through the upper atmosphere of Mars at supersonic speed. The bottom portion -- the heatshield proper -- will be joined to the backshell at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, ahead of launch.      I skipped the 3rd Image, which was just of an employee in a Clean Suit. 
1	4	Thank you for this. The MSL is a stunning bit of tech - and it will most likely cover hundreds of kilometres in its 10+ year life span.  I can't wait to follow its discoveries. But I am hoping against hope that it does not find extant life OR evidence of fossil life.  Why? Because the [Great Filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter) is why.

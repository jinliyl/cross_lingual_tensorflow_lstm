-	-	my bad but what did hubble see?
-	-	&gt; This is an artist's concept of that planet, HAT-P-7b.  Umm...
-	-	"Although Hubble is best known for its stunning imagery of the cosmos, the millionth observation is a spectroscopic measurement, where light is divided into its component colors. These color patterns can reveal the chemical composition of cosmic sources."   In other words, a rainbow stripe.  Nothing that would mean much to a layperson.  Edit: or a line graph. It can take various forms; it's just a measurement of intensity at every wavelength.
0	1	Scumbag Hubble. Takes millionth pic, doesn't show anyone.
-	-	I get that, but so are all of the pictures, but  they are pictures, not artists drawings.
-	-	Um, did you read the article? The observation was spectral data, not a visible light image.
-	-	I want to see another planet in another solar system.  
-	-	I'm not sure what you mean. Hubble takes different kinds of images, and it can also do just a spectrogram of a star or body. In this case it's just a spectrogram, and the artist made an image based on the observed data.
-	-	You got it.  Here is the first extrasolar planet directly imaged (in infrared; top image on left): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2M1207b  And the first to be directly imaged in visible light (on the right): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomalhaut_b  12 planets have been directly imaged.
1	4	Yes, that.
1	7	OVER NINE THOUSAND SCIENCE!
0	1	Scumbag NASA: article about Hubble's 1,000,000th observation.  Picture is of artist rendering.  
1	4	"Hot Jupiter!" is now my favorite exclamatory phrase.
-	-	"We are looking for the spectral signature of water vapor. This is an extremely precise observation .." 1. How are they sure there is water vapor in the atmosphere, when it is hotter than sun?  2. Is it the IR spectrum that gives precise information? Any one out there to provide some more details?
-	-	Seriously, wtf nasa
1	6	My first planet outside our solar system I have seen. Wow.
-	-	It is just some artist's mediocre rendering.
-	-	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy
-	-	The colors are, the shots are reportedly legit.
-	-	Um, did you read the article? The observation was spectral data, not a visible light image.

1	6	AWT is a clone of aether theory, which considers vacuum as a dense particle environment. Whereas the previous theories considered aether as a sparse thin gas.
-	-	Well, we can consider, at the sufficient distance the Universe is completely random and we can try to extrapolate its properties back again with using of some model of random physical system. It's basically the approach of AWT and it doesn't require too many postulates - so it's  quite general.
-	-	We have no better explanation for matter, than the dense system of space-time of various curvatures. And we have no better explanation for vacuum as well.   http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19125645.800-you-are-made-of-spacetime.html  If so, why the material model for vacuum doesn't work? Because people believed, the vacuum is formed with very thin, sparse matter - so called the aether - which penetrates the massive bodies like ghost. The people didn't realize, such thin sparse aether cannot serve as an environment for waves of light. The energy density of electromagnetic radiation (like the cosmic rays and/or gamma rays) is immense, the sparse aether cannot serve as an luminiferous aether of Victoria era.  So it's evident, if we want to model the vacuum with particle matter, we should consider it very dense instead. This idea was proposed with English physicist Oliver Lodge in 1904, but no one from his contemporaries did actually understand it. Just recently the physicists are slowly returning to this concept with using of idea, the Universe appears like interior of black hole. Black hole is apparently very dense particle stuff - so if it forms the vacuum, it must be formed with very dense matter, too.  Dense aether model of vacuum solves most (if not all) conceptual problems of sparse aether model of Victorian era. In particular, it explains, why the light waves aren't affected with motion of aether in the way, which general relativity describes. In dense particle environment the spreading of transverse waves isn't affected with motion of their environment too much - with compare to sparse particle environment, where such waves are spreading like the longitudinal waves and they're dragged with it.   The dense aether model considers, the space-time is formed with tiny density fluctuations of the hypothethetical particle environment, which are having character of foam or mesh and the light waves are spreading along them. The similar density fluctuations can be observed inside of dense compressed gas, like the supercritical fluid.  http://www1.chem.leeds.ac.uk//People/CMR/images/scco24.jpg
-	-	Some people were saying reality is made up of little grainy bits that are really small. If that was true, it'd make gamma rays from distant space explosions go all wobbly as they traveled to Earth. They didn't see the wobbliness at the size some expected, so now they have to go deeper.
-	-	well yeah, but one can validly argue that we are getting further and further away from direct experimental verifiability of the old days. Plus we need to ever more rely on probability &amp; statistics where you can tweak your formulae (either intentionally or unintentionally) to reach the desired conclusion - which wouldn't be without precedent in the scientific community.
0	1	It's not so much "unpopular scientific theory" as "a bunch of sciency words and acronyms strung together into long, meaningless rants."
1	6	Why did anyone ask that question in the first place?
0	5	read the first two paragraphs and thought they made sense   then I saw how long the post was and after seeing more and more words that made my eyes glaze over, I just upvoted for his effort. others might have done similarly
-	-	The crowds can be wrong in fundamental things, like the cold fusion or aether theory. The crowds are composed of laymans, who are orienting himself by various naive indicia, as [iCake's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ievn8/quantum_graininess_of_space_at_smaller_scales_the/c236psf) indicates. They can absorb truth only if plays well with their own belief.
-	-	&gt;The problem is that AWT proponents are like religious nuts  I'm just seeking for consistent explanations.   If you can see, I'm not attacking the proponents of relativity or quantum mechanics and I'm not downvoting them, when they're trying to bring some explanation. Unfortunately it seems, the battles at reddit are mostly done between people, who have some explanation and the people, who have none. The people, who have some explanation have no reason to  behave like religious pricks and to downvote or censor their opponents, because these opponents bring no competition for them.  Actually everything in our Universe boils down to some random particle system, if you think about it. The people spent a quite lot of money in search of TOE, so they shouldn't be surprised, if some general theory can explain more things, than the other, specialized ones.
-	-	Because it's merely  hypothetical - we could probably never see our Universe from outside. From the same reason many people refused the heliocentric model of solar system. "*Why to bother with such idea?*", they said. "*We could never travel outside of solar system to make sure, we are really revolving the Sun - not vice-versa. The geocentric model (and 640 kB) ought to be enough for anybody..*"  Well, it took just three hundred of years and we actually saw the Earth from (nearly) outside of Solar system with using of  Voyager 1 spaceprobe.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot  The same controversy repeated in weaker form later with galaxies, because many people believed, all observable stars and star nebulae belong into the same stellar body. But in 1924 E. Hubble demonstrated, the Andromeda galaxy is actually distant stellar system quite separate from our galaxy.  As we can see, the human understanding of Universe evolves  in large circles, so there's an idea, if the whole Universe doesn't behave in the same way. We can form a tiny particle inside of some larger Universe, and so on...
0	5	I really just wanted some cake.
0	1	Those are a lot of words, but none of them answered my question.  Why would we care what the Universe would look like if it were shrunk down to the size of a small black hole? That would be like asking "What would I look like if I were a teddy bear?".   It's pointless and does nothing to further our understanding of anything.
1	4	I admire your patience, Chipney. Thanks for keeping r/science scientific
0	1	It's actually not quite your problem, but the predictable problem of informational singularity.   The layman people aren't specialized, the amount of information which they can handle is limited - so that with increasing amount of informations their view and opinions are becoming superficial undeniably.  Therefore they layman's opinion can work well, until the qualitative, i.e. deep conceptual change of our understanding of reality is required. In this moment the laymans behave in the same way, like the overspecialized theorists, who have superficial informations about the whole picture - and they're fighting together against new fundamental ideas.  As Jonathan Swift once said: "*When a true genius appears in this world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him*".  I'm not a genius in any way, but the dense aether concept is really both simple, both fundamental change of existing approach to reality understanding - so that most of people are really fighting with it, because they've a good reasons for it. I don't know, how to avoid this annoying negativism in other way, than with patient explanation of aether concept again and again.
-	-	You'd be waiting billions of years for a response, if you were creating GRBs to communicate with someone that far away. Most people wouldn't want to wait that long.  For any civilizations within our own galaxy, there are much easier ways to communicate.
0	5	And not to mention that we're already getting pretty far from the realm where the general public who doesn't have a PHD in physics can say, "Well, if it's true, prove it."  The main thing that I'm worried about is when special interests fund studies.
-	-	You are trying to develop deductive conclusions based on very weak analogies and heuristic explanations, rather than the actual theoretical developments underpinning them. If you are very interested in these sorts of questions, the only proper way to address them is to learn more about GR, QM, and their current developments.
-	-	Actually, [holographic theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle) is a major area of research in theoretical physics right now, and IIRC, RobotRollCall's specialty.
0	1	Are you saying that AWT-predicted gravitational effects _exactly_ compensate LGQ and ST-predicted effects? THat's one hell of a coincidence.  Also, are you saying that AWT's own prediction is that nothing interesting happens? Don't you think that a lot of theories could produce exactly same predictions?
1	6	Yea... but what if there are no constants and the universe is slowly changing?
-	-	Not really. If it is smaller than planck, that just means it could be multidimensional effects like string theory suggests.
1	4	See, exactly. Every time i read a new article about the universe, and quantum physics, and the way everything works scientists have discovered something that makes the previous study irrelevant and outdated. Well aren't we just going to read another article in a week saying they've "discovered" something that disproves THIS study, and that something else has taken its place as "what we know about the universe"? ... the universe is intriguing and i'm not saying it's not important to try to discover everything we can about the way it works, but how do we know we're not living in a geocentric age, blinded by the "facts" about the universe that we think we know? Just to be proved absolutely wrong in years to come.  just a thought

-	-	&gt;AWT crackpot posts  It was a lot more than that.  He explained the differences between string theory and loop quantum gravity. That's the reason for the upvotes. There's also a lot of skepticism about ST and LQG, too. 
0	1	I googled AWT and I got the Wikipedia entry for Abstract Window Toolkit. I don't know whether I should be offended.
-	-	I'd just like to add one more thing to skyskr4per's explanation because according to my knowledge, it is not entirely accurate.   It's not that space is made up of little grainy bits, it's that space *itself* is grainy. If you look at space at a very small level, it should be very "jumpy" and non-constant, but as you zoom out, the bumpiness of space should look like it evens out and appears smooth.   Related, fascinating article: [Quantum foam and Loop Gravity](http://universe-review.ca/R01-07-quantumfoam.htm)  If anyone knows more about this than I do or has a problem with my explanation, please correct me.
-	-	It would make sense that, the further away we are observing, the more useless these observations are for scientific testing; because the "source" could actually be muddled by many sources.
-	-	I know, I got to "With respect to AWT..." and it felt like a Rickroll. Though "pair of mutually dual theories" did give me pause first.
1	4	Read the first paragraph and upvoted because it sounds like you know what you're talking about.
0	1	this deserves more upvotes than all the stupid pun comments that get 100 times this much. 
-	-	I'm sorry, but this deserved to be way, wayyy further down. It doesn't have any relevance to real life. You just have to look at the last sentence: "We could say, the vortex rings of gamma ray bursts are forming normal photons inside of giant hyper-universe." That literally means NOTHING. It's all pseudoscience technobabble.
-	-	Fair enough.  Don't know much about them.  Just thinking that if there were advanced civilizations, and there was a way to...simulate?...focused GRBs without using a ton of energy.  I dunno.  Just wistful thinking I guess.
-	-	This changes everything.
0	1	Unless I read it wrong the breakthrough is that they found nothing whatsoever, which rules out several quantum gravity theories.
0	2	If shit gets pixelated when it is real small - doesn't that mean this shit is a hologram? What is another explanation?
1	6	Excuse my dumb, but can someone kindly put this in layman's terms?
-	-	As you probably know, the contemporary mainstream physics is driven with pair of mutually dual theories, with quantum mechanics (QM) and general relativity (GR). The GR considers conservation of macroscopic quantities of light spreading, like the speed of light.  The QM considers the conservation (quantization) of microscopic qualities of light, for example the spin of photon.  Because these two theories mutually complement each other, the physicists are developing new metatheories, based on these two theories. Currently the most popular are string theory (ST) and loop quantum gravity theory (LQG), which are both based on different postulate set of QM an GR. The ST is more QM oriented and it considers constant speed of light, extra dimensions and it considers the particles as a low-dimensional strings and membranes, i.e. it's oriented to the description of particles. The LQG is a field theory oriented to GR instead. It doesn't care very much about particles and extradimensions, instead of it it considers the vacuum as a stringy mesh of loops, i.e. spin mesh. With respect to AWT, these two theories complement each other in similar way like the GR and QM itself - just in wider extent by principle of AdS/CFT correspondence.  When the photons of different wavelength are spreading through quantum foam forming the vacuum, these two theories predict different violation of GR and QM. The ST considers the constant speed of light, so it cannot predict the variable speed of light for different wavelengths. Instead of this it can predict, the light will change its polarization while traveling at large cosmological distances. The LQG doesn't care about polarization light too much, but it predicts, the light of different wavelengths will travel through quantum foam with different speed: the shortwavelenght light will follow surfaces of spin foam, so it will travel slower in similar way, like the blue light travels slower through dispersive environment. Red light penetrates such environment faster, because it's not dispersed with it too much (from the same reason the fog lights are yellow and morning sky is red).   The prediction of both theories work well, when the distance for light remains low and/or the energy density of light remains low. For example, we are observing the polarization or  Doppler's anisotropy of microwave radiation at the distant areas of Universe.  In the same way, we can observe the polarization of gamma radiation near black holes (like the Cygnus X1) or we can observe the delay between long wavelength and shortwavelenght portions of near gamma ray bursts, like the  MKN 501. For these situations the LGQ/ST work reasonably well.  The problem arises, when we are observing the light at both vast cosmic distances, both high energy density (gamma radiation). The proponents of both ST or LQG theories are expecting, in such situations their corrections will become quite apparent. But the exactly the opposite is true: in such situations the corrections predicted with both theories compensate mutually and we can observe anything again. For example in distant GRB 090510 whole burst arrived at Earth at the single moment. And at the case of distant GRB 041219A no polarization was observed.  AWT (dense aether theory) explains, what happens there with using of analogy with fluid mechanics. The GR says, the light has no mass, it only transfers momentum. The reason is, for photons the reference frame in space-time is not defined in GR, because for such photons the time effectively stops. But in AWT the gravity field of objects spreads much faster, than the speed of light. Even photons have gravity field around them, especially these shortwavelength ones. Therefore a bunch of gamma ray photons doesn't propagate through vacuum independently, they're attracting and revolving mutually like asteroids inside of giant vortex ring. The heavier photons are collected at center of resulting cluster, whereas these longwavelength ones are revolving them. In this way, the longwavelength photons are traveling along longer path (thus fulfilling the LQG prediction), but the whole cluster arives at Earth in single moment (thus fulfilling the expectations of ST). The mutual revolution of photons inside of gamma burst cluster destroys their polarization too.  The formation of vortex rings from photons is not new feature, the same effect we can observe during spreading of light through boson condensates. We can say, the vacuum density fluctuations are behaving with respect to gamma rays like the atoms inside of boson condensates with respect to visible light. The vortex rings of light, which are formed here are illustrating, how the photons would appear at quantum scale. We could say, the vortex rings of gamma ray bursts are forming normal photons inside of giant hyper-universe.
0	1	FYI, the research article upon which this news article is based makes no mention of the discretization of space. In other words, the sensationalist claims made in the news article have not passed the peer review process (an important step towards taking anything seriously in scienceland). This also means that there is nowhere anyone can go to see if the argument presented here holds water.  tl;dr Don't take this article seriously!
0	5	So, maybe I'm nuts, but does anyone else think that GRBs would be an excellent way to communicate with distant civilizations?  If it were possible to make them?  Just saying.  Sorry for the off topic comment.
0	1	Well, fuck.
1	6	Quantum Graininess? Weren't atoms "Grainy" when we first figured out how to look at them?
0	2	I read that as quantum grannyness. I'm way less interested now. 
1	6	Never thought I'd see one of these AWT crackpot posts actually have postitive upvotes in /r/science
-	-	Nobody prohibits to comment/oppose the Oliver Lodge original theory, for example. He was established physicist of his era with many patents, but his ideas were ignored completely. You can never find the qualified judgement of his theory from the side of other physicists - it simply doesn't exist for whole world of mainstream physics.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Joseph_Lodge#Accomplishments  After all, in the same way, like for example cold fusion experiments of S. Foccardi, antigravity experiments of Podkletnov and/or superconductivity experiments of J.F.Prins. All these experiments and founders are completely real - but their findings are simply taboo in mainstream physics. Which is indicated clearly not with presence of negative peer-reviewed articles - but with complete lack of any articles about them.
-	-	That would imply he is saying anything more than buzzwords attached to technobabble. 
1	6	OK, and which arguments for the above interpretations do you have, for example?  Isaac Asimov: "*Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic*".
-	-	If there are no constants, then the whole Universe should change randomly, which would lead into its instability. But as we can see, it's not quite true: the constants are changing consistently in such a way, even the most distant galaxies appear quite normally, composed of the same elements and stars, like these close ones.   So I tend to explanation, the changes observed are  product of spreading of light through dispersive environment, which the vacuum undeniably is - the CMBR photons are real and they should have some effect to the another photons. Such photons can undergo materialization under formation of particle-antiparticle pairs, for example, which would lead into gradual dispersion of light (Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin effect)
0	5	I find this hard to believe. Wouldn't atleast some of the genius physicists around the world grant some credence to AWT if it was decent at predicting a very wide range of phenomena? Ofcourse laymen don't have any idea what's going on, but what about the other physicists?  Just asking...
0	2	This is either extremely well-crafted satire, specialized trolling, or evidence of some sort of mental illness.  I'm not sure which it is, but I'm not willing to exclude the possibility that it's all of the above.
1	4	Thank you - but I'd would appreciate your help, after then. Don't be lazy to upvote the useful posts in the same way, like their haters aren't lazy to downvote them.
-	-	We can observe the black holes from outside and it can lead to the better predictions of Universe at the largest cosmological distances, after then.   For example, in classical theory nothing should exist outside of our Universe (i.e. outside of its particle horizon, be more specific). In black hole model of Universe the particle horizon is surrounded with many other observable objects, which we could see through holes of this horizon. For example respected astronomer and physicist Laura Mersini considers quite seriously, the WMAP cold spots are such a holes, which we can use for observation of the outside of our Universe.  I'm not saying, this approach is perfectly correct from perspective of AWT - nevertheless it appears interesting - or not? We could see outside of our space-time... Actually many ideas of mainstream physics are much more freaky, than the whole AWT as such.
0	2	&gt;so an unpopular scientific theory gets shunned by the scientific community? this has happened before only to prove everyone wrong.  Except it usually turns out that the people being shunned are wrong and fade into obscurity. You don't hear about it because "obscure theory rejected by scientific community proven wrong" makes for a shitty story.
1	6	For those of us not in the know, please elaborate. 
-	-	The AWT idea is based on the trivial assumption: well, the particles of matter are formed just with curved space-time, nothing else - right? Well, and the vacuum fluctuations are nothing but just curved space-time, OK?  If so, why not to handle the vacuum (fluctuations) like the (fluctuations of) ordinary matter, after then?
1	4	Yea... but its the European space agency.

1	6	Beyond Planck no?
-	-	&gt;However, Integral's observations are about 10 000 times more accurate than any previous and show that any quantum graininess must be at a level of 10^-48 m or smaller.  &gt;below 1.616252*10^-35 m  *(read in the 10th Doctors voice)*   WHAT. 
0	2	The problem is that AWT proponents are like religious nuts--*every* thing must be a reflection of it.  "Is Stravinsky the best composer of the 20th Century?  Jesus prefers Mahler." "Girlfriend left you?  Jesus feels your pain, bro!"  "Planning on building a new gaming PC?  Jesus recommends a Lian Li case."  Duck quack, duck walk, you get the picture.
1	7	That's a big deal.  Negative results are why science is science.
-	-	I question the basic assumption of this experiment:  &gt; According to calculations, the tiny grains would affect the way that gamma rays travel through space. The grains should ‘twist’ the light rays, changing the direction in which they oscillate, a property called polarisation.  I don't know how this idea is derived nor could I understand the math anyway, but if they're predicting this based on, say, light propogating "between" quantum grains, then of course you'll wind up with such a prediction.  But if light only travels "on" the grains, then I don't think there's any polarisation difference to be had. 
-	-	Upvoted for subtle but relevant username.
-	-	The result observed is actually quite classical one. In classical theories like the general relativity and/or quantum mechanics the vacuum is not supposed to behave like dispersive or birefringent environment, which is changing microscopic or macroscopic qualities of light. But the vacuum isn't completely flat and empty space - it's full of tiny density fluctuations of microwave photons, which are behaving like tiny Brownian noise of the underwater. Now we can ask, how the spreading of light would appear, if we consider these tiny fluctuations?  Well, it's difficult to predict it without complex math, but we can use a real-life analogies with  waves spreading at the water surface. And at the water surface the ripples are spreading in slightly different speed, which depends on their wavelength. Therefore we can expect, the speed of light waves will depend on the wavelength even in vacuum in the same qualitative way.
-	-	If we could control a GRB, we probably wouldn't need to use it as a means of communication.    That much energy would likely be more useful as a means of developing exotic forms of propulsion.    dot zero two
0	5	GRBs are not very directional. It'd be ludicrously expensive in terms of energy use - you'd be using up a significant fraction of a galaxy's *entire lifespan* in terms of usable energy for a single message.
1	8	I can understand your feelings, but there are popular ideas like the  universe inside of black hole,  hidden parallel universes and multiverses of string theorists - and animations like this one.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GDC3u8k02c  The question simply is, how the Universe would appear, if it would shrink to the size of tiny black hole. I presume, this hypothesis is testable just with gamma ray bursts, which are propagating through whole universe: it's the combination of highest observable energy density and longest distance path, which we can imagine and it gives us a clue, how the Universe would appear from perspective of creatures, which are as large, as the whole Universe.
1	8	If we go any deeper, we may risk ending up in limbo.
-	-	Well, we probably *are* terribly wrong.  That's how science works.  The point is that we're becoming *less* wrong with every experimental result.
1	6	If these results are 10000 times more accurate than any previous ones, and who that graininess must be on the level of 10^-48 or smaller, it means there were previous measurements that failed to find this quantum graininess at the level of 10^-44 or so?
0	1	ehm, I wouldnt consider myself at all savy when it comes to physics, but are you suggesting that vacuum ( space and time) as a form of matter? or did i read wrong?  if so explain please, i find your suggestion interesting! 
-	-	In physics many things appear in pairs, which are called the dualities: matter/energy, particles/antiparticles, space/time, general relativity/quantum mechanics. In AWT it's a consequence of the fact, the energy is propagating through particle environment in two ways: via transverse and longitudinal waves.
-	-	Don't know much about science myself, i like to leave the commenting in this subreddit to the people who do..
-	-	&gt;*Are you saying that AWT-predicted gravitational effects exactly compensate LGQ and ST-predicted effects?*  Actually not - I'm saying, the mutually dual aspects of LGQ and ST are compensating mutually. For example, the string theory is based on Lorentz symmetry - so it cannot predict its violation. On the other hand, the LQG can predict some violations of Lorentz symmetry (because it's based on general relativity postulates, not special relativity) - and it could be distinguished from ST in such way.  But if we observe the zero LS violation at short distance, small LS violation at longer distances and zero LS violation at the longest possible distance  - which theory is actually correct, after then? AWT just explains, how both theories can remain true at the certain ranges of their validity in the similar way, like the character of surface ripples changes from longitudinal to transverse and into longitudinal again at the water surface. The character of light dispersion in vacuum at vast cosmic distances corresponds the dispersion of water waves quite closely.  &gt;*that AWT's own prediction is that nothing interesting happens*  Macroscopically - yes. But the clusters of photons aren't nothing. They're detectable easily and their existence leads into another predictions. At first, the formation of  clusters, which are held together with their gravity - can explain the long soughed mystery of bright gamma rays, which are propagating through whole Universe without attenuation.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#Astronomy_and_astrophysics  So far astronomers considered, all photons inside of cluster originate from single event. But I do believe, most of these photons are collected from outside during long travel of gamma ray burst. This theory enables the gradual formation of large clusters from small ones on the principle of snow-ball mechanism. The luminosity of such cluster would violate the inverse square law, after then.  In addition, this model explains, why near gamma ray bursts exhibit polarization and delay in time for different wavelengths, whereas these more distant one not. This model predicts too, the short wavelength photons should cumulate at the center of gamma ray burst, when it travels at long distances. At short distances the long wavelength photons should exhibit delay, because the ring structures of photons aren't still established. It's not nothing - it's a complex functional dependence.   It's analogous to turbulence of particles in air. At short distance only the fastest particle can propagate forward. But when the turbulent behavior will change into organized vortex ring, the distribution of particles inside of each clusters will change significantly.
1	6	It could be multidimensional forces.
-	-	It's another account for this cat Zephir_AWT, who used to show up in every science thread and spout a bunch of nonsense about AWT (aka Aether Wave Theory aka Dense Aether Theory). Usually anything about AWT gets immediately downvoted, but I guess the crowd has spoken.

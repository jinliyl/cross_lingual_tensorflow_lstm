0	5	I agree that the aeroplane analogy is terrible. More complicated than an aeroplane? Does anybody not think that plants are more complicated than aeroplanes? 
0	1	Cool article, but the analogy in that quote is broken.  If there are 50 different types of airplanes...well...the design complications don't extend beyond the number 50.   In the article, the quote says "the interactions of 10 million aeroplanes of 50 different types.."   This actually makes no sense at all.  It's just a terrible analogy.
0	1	More complicated than 10 *million* aeroplanes!!!
0	1	Hell using the word "design" is terrible.  Plants aren't sentient as far as we can tell.  They can't make choices.  They can't make decisions.

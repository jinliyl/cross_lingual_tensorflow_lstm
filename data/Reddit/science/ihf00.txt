-	-	Not very damned often though. I'll take the statistical approach to negative effects over FUD any day.
1	4	great on a hot day to turn on the giant fans
-	-	Since you do not appear to have linked to the source of which you speak, [here is an appropriate link for those who are interested.](http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/sec1_5.pdf)  (The biomass number doesn't match yours, but the totals match the totals cited by the thinkprogress link, so I'm inclined to believe that this is where they got their data from.)
-	-	Burning coal is like smoking a pack a day.  Nukes are like smoking 365 packs, once a year.  Statistically it's the same number, on average.
0	5	Something is not right here...  http://www.eia.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/epm_sum.html  * Nuclear 203,193 (Thousand Megawatt hours) * Hydro 81,476 (40.1% Nuclear) * All other renewables 47,128  That is only 63% of Nuclear and almost all of it is Hydro.  Looking at the details for Other Renewables we see...  * Wind 29,654 (14.6% Nuclear) * Solar 255 (0.13% Nuclear) * Wood 8,744  * Geothermal 4,150 (2.04% Nuclear) * Biomass 4,325   While Wood and biomass are renewable I really do not think that is what most people think of when they think of renewable energy.  Hydro + Wind + Solar + Geothermal = 115,535 (56.86% Nuclear)  And another thing to think about if we look back to 1997 we see that other renewables produced 77,183 while Hydro produced 356,453  In 2010 we see Other Renewables 168,144 and Hydro 257,052  We have lost 8,440 in renewables energy production due to reduced Hydro output. We should make it up in a year or two if we can keep hydro stable. But from this data it looks like we are still a long ways from getting to 20%  Now to dig into their sources and find out why they are so far off from what the EIA (The same source they quote) has on the EIA official web site.
-	-	The only reason nuclear power hasn't replaced fossil fuels is politics and entrenched interests.
0	1	[But Wind power must be stopped!](http://www.theonion.com/video/in-the-know-coal-lobby-warns-wind-farms-may-blow-e,20876/)  Really not any more absurd than Fox news and Climate Change denial
0	1	who actually believes this nonsense?
0	2	And the fact that once in a while shit goes bad, and when it goes bad it goes really bad.
-	-	...and that we really have invested in nuclear energy since the 60s and 70s.  All the money we spent mining coal and buying fuel could have probably secured our energy needs for a long time into the future.  I love the idea of wind, solar and geothermal, and I hope we continue to invest heavily into it, but nuclear shouldn't be off the table.
1	4	This is why I posted this here, I was hoping someone could give some more insight into this since I was not certain that this report was true.   Thanks for this excellent comment.
-	-	Found the source, it is at odds with what is on the main page and points to most of this gain being in biomass. Something most greens would not be proud of.  * Biomass 1.046 * Wind .289 * Solar .026 * Geothermal .055 * Hydro .795  So again this shows the bulk of the green energy is coming from Hydro with Wind taking 2nd place and the others barely showing up.  But I guess burning wood and wood derived fuels is renewable :) 
0	1	Exactly! They put in so many of those stupid wind turbines where I live, and now it is so windy.  I wish they hadn't put those things in.  They blow everywhere and it is terrible!
-	-	Yep, not only is most of it hydro...most of that hydro has been around for ages.  And a nice thing about the increased output during floods...unlike wind you can depend on that power to be there for weeks or months.  On the bright side the biomass increases are likely from incineration.  I'm a big fan of incineration as a form of "recycling".  Almost everything we can make from recycling we can make better and cheaper with virgin materials...and you don't have to pay anyone or buy specialized machinery to separate the non-flammable materials...the fire does it for free.

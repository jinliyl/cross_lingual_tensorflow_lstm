-	-	Particulates have been linked to blood vessel inflammation, which increases risk of heart attack and stroke.  A neat thing to try is taking a vacuum cleaner, two pieces of wire window screen, and a sheet of toilet paper.  Place the paper between the screens, hold them together with paperclips or tape.  Run the vacuum cleaner for 15 minutes with the screen layers sucked onto the open end of the hose.  Make sure the power unit is down wind of the hose, so dirt from the unit itself can't affect things.  If you live in a city, the result will be a grey circle on the toilet paper, from all the pollution that got sucked through during 15 min.

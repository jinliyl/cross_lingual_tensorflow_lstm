0	2	I want to live until I choose I want to die. 
-	-	"Who wants to get old and whither away?"  What I find intriguing is the opposition to "biological immortality".  Most people to whom I've asked this question have indicated that "life without *death* would have no meaning".  This perception pervades every culture on Earth; cure the certainty of biological death and you'll be pulling the crutch out from under a lot of people's most primitive beliefs.    I wonder if mankind is philosophically mature enough to endure life without the certainty of biological death, and if a more enlightened and robust philosophy can evolve in the presence of all us old cronies...    then again, maybe a dose of youthfulness will reinvigorate such relics and we'll all be better off for it.  There's only one way to find out.
-	-	I have read this thing since 2005 in all its variations.
-	-	The lack of death by old age will create overpopulation and massive wars for resources. Of course, Americans and Europeans will have the luxury first. Once they start overpopulating their countries they will seek to expand into their poorer neighboring countries.
0	1	Regarding everyone pointing out that rich people will be able to get in on it first:  fine by me.  Let those bastards run the beta program for a while.  When it stabilizes after a decade or two, i'll gladly take a 2 century mortgage for a few millenia alive...  what's a fifth of my life (at most)?  ...  as long as it isn't indentured servitude in a lumber yard or some shit...
-	-	So lets say aging was able to be stopped. What would be the average lifespan if you could only die by trauma? Because eventually, you WILL be involved in an accident of some kind.
-	-	A few points to mull:  * Peter F. Hamilton addresses the idea of taking out "life" mortgages in his Commonwealth series, it's sort of an off-hand thing, but people basically retire, live for a while, then start working again to pay for loans to de-age.  * Albert Brooks has a new novel called *2033* the details rise of the elder class in America (under the premise that several diseases were cured), the overpowering lobby that the AARP will soon become, and an anti-age movement because the elderly will continue to suck up all the country's resources and the young will not have the political power to stop it.  * Imagine your least favorite politician playing at politics for the next 100+ years.  Imagine the Supreme Court never shifting its majority balance.  * Longer life spans could possibly change the world-views of some politicians for the better if they couldn't punt a problem off to their grandkids.  * Off-world colonization and/or terraforming might be more appealing if we knew we would live to see some of the changes.
0	5	So said Nathan Shock, Bernard Strehler, Benjamin Frank, Johan Bjorksten, Roy Walford. Where are they now? All dead.  http://chronopause.com/index.php/2011/05/30/going-going-gone/ 
0	1	Alright r/science, now tell me why I shouldn't be excited.
1	4	Interesting, to say the least.   I'd like to live for a few hundreds years, perhaps more than a thousand...  But no more than that. It would be weird, though, wouldn't it? Fathers (or mothers), sons, grandsons all being the same physiological 'age'?
-	-	I'm going to live forever, or die trying.
-	-	Who wants to live forever when love must die?
1	8	You think the people running the world are heartless now?  Give them an extra thousand years to live.  If this tech does not become cheap fast, it will destroy this species by splitting us into rich immortals and mortal poor.
0	2	Sorry dude, you're wrong.  I am old now and would relish the idea of living one hell of a lot longer.  Plus, I don't have my flying car or jet pack yet.  And not to be limited, I'd also like to see interstellar travel, holodecks, and a decent OS on a PC.
0	1	That is total bullshit; I'm in my mid 40's and would live indefinitely in a heartbeat... as long as I was in reasonable shape and could enjoy life.
1	4	Robert Heinlein wrote a set of stories which included "Time enough for love" that dealt with this very issue. I'll say that he was a very open minded person.
-	-	i want a world where everyone can live exactly as long as they wish to.
-	-	This is the same response I've heard over and over again. Did you read what he's talking about? Watch his presentation?  What some don't seem to be getting is that he's not talking about people aging to 50 like they do now, and then aging to 70 like they do now, and then aging to 100 like they do now, and then aging to 150 like the most dried up wrinkled decrepit old bag that has ever scuffled across this Earth.  What he is trying for is longer life through slower aging.  I think perhaps your opinion would be a bit different if you were as virile and active at 80 as you were at 40, and you didn't start showing real signs of being truly "elderly" until well past 100.  So many people seem to read this headline and groan at the thought of another 75 years of blown knees and a bad back.
-	-	not first. dude was paraphrasing an 18th century prussian king.
0	1	There will be bigger problems before overpopulation kicks in, IMO.  Overpopulation would take probably a few hundred years for the anti-aging treatments to become completely widespread.  In the short term, though, one of the most progressive forces in human society is death.  Don't like your country's shitty dictator?  Well, he can't live forever.  Don't like the spanish inquisition?  It'll die out eventually.  Someday your boss will retire, and you'll have the chance to take his job.  Gay marriage would have been universally opposed in the 50s, mostly opposed in the 70s/80s, and is going to be mostly accepted in the next 10 years as the 70+ year old crowd is thinned.    With human immortality, NONE of those things are true.  If you don't like El Presidente, you're going to have to kill him.  Your boss is NEVER going to retire, because this job is how he pays for his immortality treatments.  Social mobility would drop to zero.  The rich will get richer, the poor will get poorer.  Youth unemployment will go through the roof, as no one will be leaving the work force anymore.  It's a recipe for a massive number of disaffected young people.  You know, the kind of people who don't give a fuck about causing mayhem.
0	5	Rich people everywhere will have the luxury first, but yeah maybe mostly Americans and Europeans.   I'm not disagreeing with you but maybe there are other plausible (and more optimistic) scenarios? Isn't there a chance that when we expect to live indefinitely many will also postpone getting their first child indefinitely?  With the life expectancies we experience now there is already a great number of women who wait too long before their first pregnancy and find that they can't get pregnant.  You could expect all sorts of major cultural changes when everybody expects to live drastically longer, so the future will be hard to predict.  
1	6	I'm curious, why no more than that? If it's a worry about lack of things to do after a few centuries of life I'd be happy to give ya some ideas.   Personally I could fill millions and millions of years living in worlds, both virtual and real (though I'm guessing the line separating the two will be very blurry in the near future) 
1	6	It'll REQUIRE some extremely stringent population control measures. People of the future will find it amazing that everyone is free to have as many kids as they want.  I wonder how the Mormons will take the news.
-	-	&gt;There are some things that may even actually be random, instead of just appear so.  That's the question.   And if you truly do have a tiny chance each day of dying from x, then probability theory says you will eventually.
1	4	Good points. I never considered religious ramifications. I think that people will give up their religion with a huge fight. So if even some people are dieing in accidents, their souls still go to heaven. Real immortality with a backup of your consciousness would likely cause more uproar.   Though I would admit that it is such a huge game changer, none of us will likely predict the correct outcome. You are right that it would be revolutionary,  I didn't mean to downplay that. My point was people won't go apeshit when Mr elite is going to live to 150 years. Then it will be 250, etc. All incremental increases to keep the youngsters from questioning anything. It won't be forever overnight; that might cause some different drama. 
-	-	I don't think it's theoretical to say that death is a progressive force in human society.  Do you think all the people who believed that the sun revolved around the earth, or that the earth was flat, or that Odin was god were convinced of the error of their ways by rational discourse?  Nope.  The just died believing their same world views, and were replaced by people that had a slightly different world view.
-	-	I meant "everyone circa 2011 is free to have as many kids as they want (excluding China)".  And it IS true today. I can father as many children with as many women as I can manage. There is no limitation on that at all.
-	-	If you look on it on a large scale and over a longer period of time, people seem to adjust their preferences. If you look at [birth rates in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Birth_rate_figures_for_countries.PNG), you can see that people in richer countries tend to have low birth rates. In Sweden where I live, there is almost no net gain (people get born and die at roughly the same rate.)
0	1	I think you are Way overestimating people. Gulf spill, fukushima, fracking, etc have all caused massive damage to people. They are in many cases guaranteed to die from these events while the perpetrators get even richer... and no one has done a damn thing.
1	6	How many people do you know that think, "It will be better when I get to heaven!" There are a lot of them, what happens when they can't or just don't think that anymore? What happens when they see for the first time how hugely responsible they are for their own "eternity." It's a society changer. It's a human value changer. It's a revolution of such proportions in human thought to be likened as the enlightment times a billion. If you don't think there would be revolutions in every way imaginable by the prospect of real immortality, I'm surprised to say the least.
-	-	yeah but in the modern era, death is simply a retardant to scientific progress. a lot of scientists don't see the point in taking on some of the more time consuming tasks because they know they won't be here to see the rewards. maybe not indefinite lifespan. but i see no problems with extending it to possibly ten times what it is now.
1	7	And we can love forever
0	2	&gt;One can always avoid accidents, though generally only by avoiding life rather than really living it.  The problem is that we don't know everything and we probably never will. There are some things that may even actually be random, instead of just appear so. So, if you have a 0.01 or 1% chance of dying in a car accident in 20 years, as the time approaches infinity, the probability approaches 1 or 100%. It doesn't have to be a car accident, though; it could be a meteor, war, choking on your food, murder... There *are* things that are beyond our (each individual's) control and some that will probably always be. Of course, you could argue quantum immortality in the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, but the discussion would effectively end there.   Either way, forever is a pretty damn long time. I'd probably kill myself, eventually, even if just out of boredom. 
-	-	[The TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging.html)
-	-	Just long enough to transfer my consciousness to a more stable entity.
0	2	Aubrey put it this way: these rejuvenation technologies need to get funded some way and government funding is unlikely; so let the rich be the lab rats. Right now there is a growing but somewhat unfounded interest among the western world in longevity. In order for the majority to step on board (researchers and public), they need demonstrations but until they cough up the change, the SENSF is limited in what they can accomplish in the timeline Aubrey has announced. So the rich have been and will continue to be for some time the only ones who can supply SENSF with the billion or so dollars it claims it needs. If the majority of middle to low wage income families in America at least are truly afraid of what you have just claimed in your comment then they can tell their representatives and senators to subsidize these longevity technologies. Unfortunately, the majority of Americans still claim to be religious and thus see no need for living indefinitely (for the time being) when they have some rosy expectations of an afterlife. This crowd will really only get on board once these technologies are proven, as they will be perceived as the new standard of living. Aubrey also seems confident that a restorative approach where people stay young is much cheaper in the long run compared to providing for the expenses of the elderly; indeed, the last few years of a person's life are the most expensive ones.   If you know any million or billionaires make sure to tell them about SENSF.
0	1	But touch my tears with your lips
-	-	As you get older, the folly of it become more clear.  If you say yes today, odds are your are young.  Come back when you are 50 or 60 and we'll ask again.  Most likely you'll a different opinion.
-	-	Medicine can't even fix my knees.  But I'm sure we'll cure all disease and such in the next 25 years.
1	4	Great, we'll never get rid of baby boomers now :-(
-	-	Here is the guy who asked the question [first.](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Daniel_Daly)Battle cry at Belleau Woods:  "Come on you sons of bitches..Do you  want to live forever?"
-	-	And http://www.mfoundation.org/ and http://www.longecity.org/forum/
0	5	That had very little to do with Nintendo. I am disappointed. 
-	-	Yossarian!
-	-	[deleted]
0	2	That is assuming society remains unchanged. Who says it will be the norm to have children in 100 years?  Either way, what is exactly is a mistake? Would you rather we didn't try to cure diseases, prevent alzheimers, prevent old people from getting weak?   How about we cancel all cancer treatment. In fact, let's just close all the hospitals, let anyone who's sick die and ban doctors. That'll help on the overpopulation issue!
-	-	Only the very well to-do would be able to afford it, at least at first.
-	-	Overpopulation is not a problem, what makes you think it's an issue even worth noting? 
-	-	Touch my world with your fingertips
-	-	&gt;Aging does not **directly** cause any of those things.  "Weakened bones and muscles" don't push you down the stairs.  "Rapidly deteriorating eyesite and reaction time" don't *steer* your vehicle into oncoming traffic.   "The sudden onset of the realization that most of the people you've cared about in your life are gone and that you will soon join them" doesn't shoot you in the face.   Then again, perhaps the idea of 'direct' is not to well defined. There can be many causes in-between.   Either way, what m0llusk meant is that people will still fall, crash vehicles and kill themselves even if they don't age. 
1	4	Yeah, cancer incidence goes up exponentially with age.  It's quite possible that many anti-aging treatments would actually increase the incidence of cancer, as they would provide some of the things cancers need (telomerase expression, capacity for self renewal, etc.)
-	-	Are you willing to bet your life on that?
-	-	The people who could afford it would have already had children by that time, I imagine. 
0	2	&gt;Rich people everywhere will have the luxury first  Probably, but I don’t think it would last very long.     People can accept they will never live in a million dollar house like the rich guy.  Knowing he will get to live in it forever while they take a dirt nap might be a bit too much for some people to take.   
-	-	"Come to America. We are home to the brave and the functionally immortal."
-	-	Let me think about it for a 1000 years and get back to you.
0	1	*rich people* will be able to live forever. they will also be able to genetically modify their babies so that they are superior both physically and intellectually. REMEMBER GATTACA GUYS?!?
-	-	Yeah incremental increases could be interesting. But my guess is its likely to be a quick jump, the scientist might say, oh, you can now live to 150! But the person who lives to 150 will still be alive when they make it possible to live to 500, and really once you've elongated the human life that long, the science is already there to make it indefinite. And that's really the thing. Once the prospect of immortality is on people's mind, like really on their minds, where it doesn't seem like a fairy tale anymore, revolution is probably inevitable.
0	1	Not me!
-	-	This is actually part of the plot to the book that the TV series Flash Forward was based on.
-	-	WHEN LOVE MUST DIE
-	-	I guess the uncomfortable truths well was wrong... 
-	-	I'd take eternity, especially given if I last long enough we will master quantum manipulation of matter and have effectively infinite whatever we want.
-	-	No One Lives Forever
-	-	I want to live forever, turns out.
-	-	Rich ofcs
-	-	&gt; If Aubrey de Grey's predictions are right, the first person who will live to see their 150th birthday has already been born. And the first person to live for 1,000 years could be less than 20 years younger.  A few years ago he was saying that the first person to live to 1,000 years has probably been born. I guess curing aging is harder than he initially expected.
-	-	I want to live long enough to see humans walk on another planet outside our solar system.  One to two thousand years should do it.  
1	6	exactly. i think when i'm 500-1000 years old. i might say "okay. i saw quite a bit of things and stuff. good night everybody!"
-	-	&gt;The lack of death by old age will create overpopulation and massive wars for resources.  Well we already have that so it seems obvious that _having_ old age doesn't prevent overpopulation and resource wars... so... got another point?
-	-	I think Aubrey said around a 1000 years, but this is more of a guesstimate. Aubrey has often said SENS research would yield more transitionary therapies that would buy us time to develop more robust nanotechnology for biological applications.
1	7	yeah. that was then. this is forty years from now. science is a rapidly explosive progression. 
-	-	I think a better adage is: no person ought to live like they have forever.
1	4	The real challenges so far haven't been in the research but in evangelizing to secure funding and changing the public's perception of the aging process. Right now the SENSF is only receiving a partial amount of the funding Aubrey claimed would be required to achieve the timelines he mentioned, and even then he said the likelihood of achieving this timeline would be close to 50%. I think things are going exactly or even better than their expectations.
-	-	wouldn't it be beautiful if that was the only way you died though? i would accept my death after 1000 years if i happened to trip and fall off a cliff. on the way down i'd be thinking "damn...what a crazy long ride"
0	2	Not to mention cancer. If we don't find cures for different cancers, which most people get eventually if they live long enough, "curing aging" won't be as interesting. Yay I get to live until I get cancer instead of a heart disease!
-	-	Weakened bones and muscles don't cause falls? Rapidly deteriorating eyesite and reaction time don't cause vehicle crashes? The sudden onset of the realization that most of the people you've cared about in your life are gone and that you will soon join them doesn't cause depression?  I would say that aging doesn't necessarily cause any of those things, but it's still a major contributing factor.
-	-	Well, it's a pretty central part of it.
-	-	Here's the SENS foundation if anyone is interested http://www.sens.org/
-	-	me.
-	-	Fixing aging does not mean living forever.  Some of the most common causes of death are falls, vehicle crashes, and suicide.  Aging does not directly cause any of those things.
-	-	And we can have forever 
-	-	That isn't a comforting thought. *shudder*
-	-	I expect these same people hear "fountain of youth" with hopeful eyes on what is currently fantasy but is exactly what this man is trying to replicate within reason.
-	-	Yes, that's what I'm looking for.  I'm 38 and the desire to live forever is just as strong as it was when I was 20.  I want to see what the human race is capable of over the next few thousand years.  I honestly don't think I could ever get bored of living and learning new things.  
-	-	cite?
-	-	Why would people of the future believe "everyone is free to have as many kids as they want" when that isn't true today? People will continue to use birth control and there seems to be a correlation between longer lifespans and postponed reproduction.
0	2	that is all theoretical. literally every part of what you just said is theoretical. there is absolutely no way to know what this would do to culture. i could honestly see it being incredible for us. it would make scientists more interested in space colonization, as we would finally have lifespans that correspond to the ridiculous time it would take to go anywhere. of course, what i'm saying is theoretical too, but i just think we ought to give it a shot haha.
-	-	Methinks you underestimate the change of mindset in people if they realize that if they don't fix their shitty life, they will have to put up with it.... forever.
-	-	that doesn't make any sense lol. how am i "betting my life" on it? if it doesn't happen, i suppose i'll die like errybody else.
0	2	Yes, but not with as much frequency. His statement made it seem as though none of those things would *ever* factor into those eventualities. Which is just not true. They are main contributing factors in many instances of those things.  And being pushed isn't the only way to fall down... steering into oncoming traffic isn't the only way to get into an accident... and, well, that last one wasn't really well thought out because I didn't want to leave it out. But I'm sure there's an example somewhere that helps further my point.  Late addendum: I actually don't think his point was to point out a fallacy, but rather to just be argumentative about the title. While, yes, accidents occur and thus you are not truly immortal in the strictest sense, aging is really the only real barrier to living forever. One can always avoid accidents, though generally only by avoiding life rather than really living it. Thus, the question of being able to live forever is based on death by aging rather than accident.  In essence, arguing for the sake of argument, rather than making a real point.

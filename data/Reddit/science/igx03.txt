-	-	Did you just have a seizure?
-	-	If it's new--I'd imagine.
-	-	It is the contemplation of one's navel (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphaloskepsis).  Technically it refers to a type medieval Christian Mysticism, who sought understanding by looking inward and ignoring everything outside of their center, including the senses. But in this context i was using the literal word of omphalos= navel and skepsis= examination.  
-	-	Are you talking to yourself or to someone that never said whatever it is you're trying to argue about?
0	1	Actually I was talking to the people who are "creeped out", have smelled of their naval "gunk", and  the "Clean your belly buttons" people.  Just because it is there **doesnt mean it is dangerous** to us!
1	4	Immediately upon reading this I picked the gunk out of my belly button and smelled it(for science). I can confidently say that my qualitative olfaction data does correspond with this article's conclusion: there is some seriously funky stuff growing down there.
1	4	Sounds like the kind of research that's likely to win an IgNobel prize. First makes you laugh, then makes you think.
0	1	Clean your damn belly buttons people!
-	-	So if I find something new in there I get to name it?
-	-	I like knowing I'm an ecosystem.
-	-	That must have been fun to write that grant proposal to be an omphaloskepsic. 
1	8	Dont be idiots. Your body is normally the host of thousands of different bacteria - most of it NEEDED for good health - its good for you.  Just because "science" doesnt know about them doesnt mean they are bad for you. They might be NEEDED for your good health.
0	3	Ok, I'm officially creeped out. Gonna go wash out by belly button right now. 
1	4	Has to be done, for science!
0	5	Don't jump to any conclusions yet, the data is still pretty fuzzy.

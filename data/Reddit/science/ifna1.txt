-	-	Hmm, I think you literally can't see some of this stuff.   If (for argument's sake) our eyes are 30FPS and this is 1000FPS, then with our naked eye we can only see about 1 in every 30 frames from this video. Anything that happens in those other frames is lost to us completely. 
-	-	Are your sound card drivers up to date?
-	-	Most likely not. I have only seen pics and vids of Hammerax cymbals but they all have the same finish, which is completely different than the one in this vid. This one looks like a Zildjian A custom or possibly a Sabian AAX or HHX and they've either stripped the logo, covered it with CGI, or it's just hidden by the water they put on it for effect. 
-	-	In Regular Life. "In Real Life" is so passe. :P
-	-	Vibrations you can see happening more slowly
0	2	and you're done.
1	4	Yes.
0	2	Worst.orangered.ever.
0	1	Well fuck, I guess the song just sucks then.
-	-	[Slow motion dogs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F52dx9Z0L5k)
-	-	This was not very difficult to fap to.
-	-	[Related](http://vimeo.com/4167288)
-	-	We use Fluke stuff at work. Awesome video :)
-	-	I like how this was on r/woahdude way before it made it to r/science
1	6	But where's the booty popping?
-	-	If only they could have gotten Fluke to produce the music for their video..
-	-	[Reminds me of this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5bYDhZBFLA)
-	-	A lot of these things are very much visible to human eyes.
0	1	[Somehow this music would be more approrpriate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5bYDhZBFLA) considering all the workshop tools porn.
1	7	The cymbal was an amazing sight!
1	6	That dog!
-	-	The human eye has a sample rate of about 30 frames per second, meaning that we can resolve about 15 hertz vibrations. Anything faster aliases, much like hubcaps appear to revolve backwards at certain speeds.  At 1000 frames per second, vibrations up to 500 hertz can be captured without as much aliasing. This will reveal more subtle behaviors.  See Nyquist's Sampling Theorem.
0	1	Goddam I hate linkbacks in blog attribution 
-	-	&gt;They do the same thing IRL     Because the slowed down video wasn't IRL? :P
0	1	Cymbal here. WTF ASSHOLE?!?
-	-	Could the cymbal in the video have been one of those?
0	2	I wasn't calling reddit a circle-jerk.  I said he had to go through a circle-jerk, as he started in reddit, and ended up, through several steps, back at reddit for the answer.  Anything can be a circle-jerk.
-	-	You could just plug a PC in and play stuff at 120HZ, though
-	-	PCI slot seems to function correctly. The built in soundchip also does, as does the soundchip of my other computer.
-	-	&gt;totally stupid  Yr mean.
-	-	I didn't say you could see it as well, just that you could see it, it's just over really fast.
-	-	No it isn't
0	2	everything...  includes parent sex?
0	5	Thank you, I felt like I'm taking crazy pills.
-	-	Close your eyes and you'll see it.
-	-	Me too. I thought it was going to be about either some form of [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_nystagmus) or the effects of sound on human eyeballs.
-	-	And they put it in the perfect place in the video, timed perfectly with the (bad) music.
0	5	I thought it was going to be a 1000fps shot of the vibrations of the human eye. I was disappointed.
0	5	I did the same! :o I kept waiting for the shot of the eye to show up, but then the video ended and I read the title again, and again. In my defense, I'm tired!
-	-	it appears to be made of jelly.
1	4	Yeah, that was cool. You could see the *shape* of the sound. Nice. 
-	-	Here's a longer video of the cymbal. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpoanOlb3-w
0	1	You're right...  You know what? Fuck the DSLRs and the RED camera. Everyone should get a Phantom
-	-	&gt;No longer art. Viral marketing  Then all of a sudden he just up and went totally stupid and none of us knew what to do...
-	-	It can be both. Full time artists need to be paid by someone. Or are you claiming that anyone who makes their living by making art isn't really an artist?  Some of the greatest works of art in history were commissioned by the powerful individuals and organizations of the day. Michaelangelo didn't paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling on whim, he was commissioned to do it by the church.
-	-	Maybe that's why it isn't on the air anymore.
0	1	Don't forget about those crabs! Someone has to go grab them crabs! It's *deadly*!
-	-	The thing about those tvs are that the content isn't actually 120hz, a lot just flicker to make it look faster. I agree that we can tell the difference though.
-	-	Don't forget about the deadly ice road warp truck-catchers. 
-	-	Maybe the PCI slot is bad.
-	-	Then why not just say "irritating" instead of using a word with multiple meanings....
-	-	It's also interesting to see how much [the human body](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTmRUH0uYgw&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=PL9A7377D11F047397&amp;index=18) deforms when struck.
-	-	Yeah, I was amazed at how the cymbal basically turned into mush upon hitting it.
-	-	Well when you play the bass guitar, you can see the wave (under strobe light) of the string because it is such a low frequency, the cymbal is a really high frequency, so the wave would be really fast and shallow and even for 1,000 fps, there is stuff we aren't seeing. If we had a 30,000 fps camera, the "deformity" would look a lot smoother
-	-	That was the only "Wow" for me.  The rest was all stuff I'd seen in slow motion.  I don't remember seeing a cymbal crash like that before.  
-	-	[for the lazy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw0tHr_H6-8)
1	4	Every time I see a slow motion video, I have to check and see if the price has come down to something affordable.  Everything looks amazing in slow motion.
1	8	This man deserves far more upvotes for having to go through this circle-jerk.  Thank you!
1	7	Thanks much, you saved me time and effort today.
-	-	Does anyone know what the song playing in the video is?
-	-	Discovery used to have a show called "time warp" that did stuff like this.
-	-	Here's a cool video from Discovery with a really tight drummer, Mike Mangini, that shows more of this kind of stuff: [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8Gxut0odyc)
0	1	Stop calling reddit a circle-jerk
1	4	Agreed. It was painful. Ironically, I FF'd through most of it just to get to the slow motion.
1	4	Yeah but they like heheheh slap each other and stuff heheheheh its so coooooool
-	-	And what the someone really means is that germs are translucent.  
-	-	To me **to the naked eye** means you can't see it unaided, the things in the video you can see unaided if you pay close enough attention.
-	-	Why are you playing the bass guitar next to a strobe light?
-	-	Drummer here. If you guys liked the cymbal, look up Hammerax liquicy cymbals on YouTube. They do the same thing IRL as the ones in the slowed down video. 
-	-	&gt;30,000 fps  So I'm guessing they won't have those at my local Best Buy...
1	4	I love seeing the bass guitar strings under the strobe.  
0	5	I liked the cymbal and the dog.  Have you ever seen a super slow-mo replay of a golfer hitting a drive?  The club vibrates so much it looks like it'd be hard to hold on to.
0	5	I was expecting something more impressive...
0	5	I totally expected that link would bring me to a video about microsaccades - the vibrations OF the eye that we're not aware of, but without them, photoreceptors would adapt and we would be effectively blind.  Is it wrong I'm a little disappointed?
-	-	Stuff like this is why I felt [T](http://youtu.be/cGpKM9JlxFg?t=2m32s)[i](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FqpDmUO0y0&amp;feature=related)[m](http://youtu.be/90VyvOhPmA0?t=29s)[e](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaim3qmxhk0&amp;feature=view_all&amp;list=PL9A7377D11F047397&amp;index=4) [W](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Ch2pNkZwU&amp;feature=view_all&amp;list=PL9A7377D11F047397&amp;index=14)[a](http://youtu.be/wlvvD4BEias?t=1m43s)[r](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA3jXe2pwUI&amp;feature=sh_e_top&amp;list=SL)[p](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTmRUH0uYgw&amp;feature=sh_e_sl&amp;list=SL) was such a fascinating show
0	5	Too bad no one has a monitor that can display 1000 fps.
1	4	Everything looks cool at 1,000 fps
0	1	The cymbal was the only thing cool? Nothing else really vibrated. Or at maybe my beast eyes have been seeing vibrations this whole time and everyone else's mortal eyes are inferior to mine.....
1	4	Further proof that I will enjoy [almost] anything shot at high speed and slowed down.
-	-	[relevant](http://www.infobarrel.com/media/image/7217_featured.jpg)
-	-	TIL Fluke is now manufacturing vibrators... FOR SCIENCE!
-	-	For the music: http://propadatafilms.bandcamp.com/album/vibrations  Had to trace it back to Laughing Squid &gt; Geekosystem &gt; back to reddit (/r/videos) and then to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/i7xqt/vibrations_cymbal_hit_at_1000_frames_per_second/c21luhy).
-	-	Definitely my favorite part,too.  I would love to just see an HD video of *Animals Living in Slow Motion* (in the [*Thirrrrd Dimension!*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMQ-t3nGzrI))
-	-	Then you are gonna love this  [Dogs jumping in slow motion and awesome music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLJwab_keTk)
-	-	That puppy needs Dyson airblade!
-	-	Dat dawg
-	-	I had a Fluke Networks hat but I lost it at a Duran Duran concert.   I bet that's the first time that sentence has ever been uttered by anyone.
-	-	But unfortunately it was so slow it wasn't enjoyable to watch.  In between shots of cool things there would be 15 minutes of painful banter.
0	1	Discovery has NO time nowadays to be making shows about unseen micro-vibrations when there are swamp logs that need to be hauled! 
1	6	Used to?  Seriously Discovery?
-	-	I've never seen aliasing with my own eyes, only on films/videos. I don't think our eyes sample in the same way as a camera shutter. 
-	-	None of those are invisible... 
-	-	Just to be clear, Fluke manufactures test equipment, not vibrators.
-	-	anytime there is a corporate logo, that entity paid for the creation of the "Art". No longer art. Viral marketing. 
0	1	No...no...NOOOOOO!!!!!!
1	4	You are correct 
0	5	I was bored last night, didn't want to watch a bunch of anime on Adult Swim, so I switched to Discovery.  SWAMP LOG MARATHON.  "We're not going to make the goal of 100 shipments!"  "We barely made it."  Next episode:  "We're falling way behind!"  "We caught up."     *snore*
-	-	Actually u can tell the difference between a 60 and 120hz tv aswell... it looks lifelike smooth, so our eyes can perceive a MUCH higher framerate than 30
-	-	I completely agree. The human eye is not capturing an entire frame at 30 fps. The biology of the eye and the optic nerve can lead to some complex photon measurement behavior. On average, however, it can be approximated as such.
-	-	Grating can simply mean irritating. See your nearest dictionary. 
-	-	Known as the [Nyquist rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_rate)
0	2	What? Am I not entitled to think that the song in the background is terrible? I watched it on mute after I got 30 seconds into it.  If I watched that a few times, yeah, I would need speakers. That song is a treble filled disaster. 
-	-	I think that the background music is grating, and I do not need new speakers, nor a new sound card.
-	-	The only part I found impressive was the cymbal. Not to say the rest wasn't cool but there was no context to most of it. An up close shot of water (I think) on the end of a piece of metal (I think)? Okay...could you tell us what we're at least looking at?
-	-	I thought this was a good promotional video. I was wondering how "vibration tester" is a real thing until the wobbly motor came on and then it made sense.
-	-	[Here is a thermal video of a fart.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0wu-1OaFJ8)
-	-	nope, still not bored of watching super slo-mo vids
-	-	I want that puppy.
0	1	Great video but that music in the background is fucking grating. 
-	-	Mindblowing stuff, and yeah, I was definitely not expecting to see such deformation in the cymbal. :)
0	2	What an verbose title for a slow motion video
0	1	What is FLUKE trying to sell here?
1	6	Was there a video posted similar to this, must have been a while ago, of a guy plucking cello strings? They looked like wet flappy spaghetti as he was plucking them, but it didn't appear to be slowed down footage - just really clear, I guess. Anyone?
-	-	That's like saying "you can see germs if you look hard enough."  Nope.
-	-	I don't think you can. Our eyes are nowhere near equivalent to 1000 FPS, no matter how you squint.
-	-	Yep, that was the "Wow!" moment for me too.  Maybe because we know the other things vibrate but we just don't expect a cymbal to deform that much.
-	-	The cymbal is the only one i could had really related too. Just seeing that thing change shape was incredible.
1	4	everything is interesting in super slow mo
1	4	i love it when albums are available on bandcamp. it's such a nice way to preview and then acquire music.  thanks for the link!
-	-	as soon as I saw the logo for a company, I suddenly doubted any of it was actually real.
-	-	Not so much invisible as really happening really fast so it's hard to notice.
1	6	What? No dildos?
-	-	[Now I will be forever scared of hitting a cymbal again](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpoanOlb3-w), now that I know that there's some generational loss whenever it's done, that fine mist I think, aka wear and tear?  **DAMMIT I WANT ALL THINGS TO LAST FOREVER**  EDIT: Apparently I'm an idiot, and that was just mist and dew on the cymbal itself. Was still a shock for me to see it deform that much, though.
-	-	I could see them just fine I don't know what you are talking about.
-	-	Those were some [good vibrations](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eSN8Cwit_s).
-	-	I read the title as *Vibrations INSIDE the Human Eye Shot at 1,000 Frames Per Second*  ... I haven't had my coffee yet this morning...
1	4	Wow! I didnt know that things that vibrate are covered in water!  Amazing what you can see when you slow things down to 1000 frames per second!
1	6	That is simply amazing!
-	-	Why? It just seemed like they showed the frames for that sequence in reverse order to get a neat effect.
1	6	Oh god. I first read that as booty pooping was was like ಠ_ಠ
-	-	I think you need new speakers.
-	-	Maybe its time to upgrade from Soundblaster pro...
1	4	This is relevant to my interests.
-	-	I think that's been proven to be a fake. (I was disappointed, too)  The thing is, we have the technology to do it for real, so why hasn't it been done yet?
-	-	I believe we need twice the FPS to make things looks smooth though, that's why we can tell the difference between [30 and 60 fps](http://www.boallen.com/fps-compare.html).
-	-	Saying that the human eye has a sample rate of 30 fps is very misleading.   This link says more about it than I cba to.  http://www.100fps.com/how_many_frames_can_humans_see.htm
-	-	It takes a really skilled network and a team of dedicated professionals to take the concept of a show all about filming cool stuff in slow motion and turn it into something as boring as Time Warp.
-	-	That's usually what it means when someone says invisible **to the naked eye.** It's the same idea as when someone says germs are invisible. 
-	-	[This whole show](http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/time-warp/time-warp.html) is dedicated to doing this with different moving objects.

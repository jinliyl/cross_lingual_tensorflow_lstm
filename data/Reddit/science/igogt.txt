0	1	I think the Chinese are pragmatic on this issue. If it blows out to sea with the prevailing winds ...not much of a problem. The problem is with the stagnation over populated areas. The acid rain is secondary to the health problems suffered by the people though. That is the reason the plants will be cleaned up.

0	5	This is a publication coming out from PNAS guys - it's a very strong signal that it's legit, since it's one of the 3 leading flagship journals in the sciences.  I hate climate change denialism just as much as any other scientist, but we must respect the facts. Yes, anthropogenic global warming *does* exist, but other anthropogenic influences can *also* exist. In fact, there was a brief period of global cooling in the 1950s due to all the sulfur by the heavy pollution in those years.   That all being said, this could be a temporary effect as China *really* does want to reduce all the health problems from all its sulfur. And then we'll see a period of accelerated warming. Unless we practice geoengineering or mitigation in some other way (I'm quite pessimistic about the prospects of real CO2 mitigation)
-	-	&gt; The answer seems counterintuitive. It's all that sulfur pollution in the air from China's massive coal-burning  Why would this be counter-intuitive? We know it has happened before, and only ended after a series of international treaties, [one of which was intended to mitigate sulfur](http://www1.american.edu/ted/SULFUR.HTM) from coal burning power plants.
-	-	This study doesn't contain the time curve of atmospheric sulphur concentration (sulphate the less) - although all extrapolations and deductions are based on it. It's all just a speculation from this perspective. The influence of sulphates to the global cooling is speculative too. Sulfate aerosols are believed to reflect sunlight back into space. The gamma rays are linked to global warming, because they're believed to form aerosols too. Surprisingly, in such case these aerosols are believed to contribute to the global warming. The graph in the study doesn't prove the contribution of sulphur emissions to the global cooling - on the contrary, it's itself based on this assumption.
-	-	[Global Dimming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_dimming)
0	1	I tell you why. Because climatology is not really a science and these guys know shit about predicting anything. They have their models which are far from working and much more far from be proven to work (like 3 centuries).
0	2	How is this possible?  Alarmists have repeatedly informed me there has been no stop or slowing in warming, that the models have been completely accurate and that I'm retarded for thinking otherwise.
1	6	i trought it was global cooling.. now its warming.. and cooling again?
-	-	"temporarily" - is that using real time or geological time?  
-	-	IMO the slowing of global warming is linked to suppression of solar activity due the temporal change of location of center of mass of solar system with dense cloud of neutrinos. We can observe the similar effects at another planets of solar system. The neutrinos manifest with another effects, like the increasing of geovolcanic activity (they're acellerating the decay of radioactive elements, which increases the heating of marine watter and earth mantle), they're causing changes of gravity constant, speed of light, dilatation of iridium prototypes etc.
-	-	And a Black Swan appears!   This "Study" is based on tweaking the inputs to a model.  Enrico Fermi had this advice for Freeman Dyson about manipulating [arbitrary parameters.](http://cmm.cit.nih.gov/~hassan/dyson.pdf)  Whether this supports AGW or the Skeptic position is irrelevant. The process is flawed. The chart shows Europe And the US and South America SO2 output peaking and declining from about 1975 to 2000. In 1975 these  3 sources were about 3 times the output China in 2000.  In 2000 China had still not reached the emissions of Sulfur Dioxide that the US had in 1975. In 2000 the previous 3 main emitters had lowered output significantly and in toto were roughly the equivalent of China's output.  And so the warming for the past 30 years could be attributed not to CO2, but to massive reductions in Sulfur Dioxide and the recent leveling off of temperature could be due to China returning the levels toward those experienced several decades before.  Until the models are replaced with actual empirical science we will probably not know the real reasons behind the run up of temperatures in the late 20th century.  Science by deduction is not science...it is letting your beliefs lead you in the absence of proof.
-	-	Even the article name is tautological: you shouldn't correlate climate change with temperature change, because temperature itself is important aspect of climate - this is what the circular reasoning is called. And the rest of study continues in the same spirit - for example, I'm missing the sulfur dioxide concentration curve in it. The radiative forcing of sulfur emissions presented in the study should be the result of the model from underlying data - unfortunately no such data or model are given.  http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pnas-201102467.pdf  My above explanation allows correlation of volcanic emissions with global temperature, because they both share the same origin - but the correlation isn't causation here. &gt;"*...Sulfur particles in the air deflect the sun's rays and can temporarily cool things down a bit..."*  This is just a hypothesis. In addition, they probably meant *sulfate* particles, which are believed to behave so. But was the sulfate particles concentration measured?  Actually the only source of antropogenic sulphur documented in the study is the Stern's "*Global sulfur emissions from 1850 to 2000*", where it's extrapolated from coal emissions. How such data can be falsified? This study doesn't contain the time curve of atmospheric sulphur concentration (sulfate the less) - although all extrapolations and deductions are based on it. It's all just a speculation from this perspective.   The influence of sulphates to the global cooling itself is highly speculative, too. Sulfate aerosols are believed to reflect sunlight back into space. The gamma rays are linked to global warming, too, because they're believed to form aerosols too. Surprisingly, in such case these aerosols are believed to contribute to the global warming. 
1	4	And so we mitigate SO2 in the mid 70's and the level decreases sharply by the end of the century. Global warming goes up sharply. China pours out SO2 and the temperatures level off. Hmmmm.
-	-	Science is not the scientific method.  Science is the search for the truth and the only metric we have that can be universally applied to it is peer review.  It isn't like climatologists have a room full of Earths to experiment on.  Any model will be incomplete and not rigorously proven.  That doesn't mean climatologists shouldn't still attempt to discover the truth or that they should be ignored for not following a more robust methodology that is not even possible in their field.
-	-	It seems like climate modelers don't have a knob for turning temperature down other than aerosols.  
-	-	My research confirms this.

-	-	  &gt;Data for anthropogenic sulfur emissions (21) are calculated using measures of economic activity that emit sulfur (see SI Appendix: &gt;Section 1). Variables other than SOI are converted to radiative forcing using &gt;formulae (22, 23) that are described in Stern and Kaufmann (24). For sulfur, &gt;the conversion to radiative forcing includes both direct and indirect effects. &gt;To update the time series for anthropogenic sulfur emissions (21), we obtain the share of 2000 global sulfur emissions for six categories of sulfur emitting activities; coal consumption, petroleum consumption, metal smelting, &gt;marine bunkers, natural gas consumption, and other (25). These shares &gt;are used to update the last observation (â€˜00) for emissions by updating each &gt;category of emissions with data that relate to anthropogenic activities (e.g., &gt;sulfur emissions from coal consumption are updated based on global data for &gt;coal consumption). A detailed description of the methodology and its sensitivity to assumptions about the rate at which sulfur is removed from the emission stream are given in the SI Appendix.  hmm  &gt;For example, the reliability of data for &gt;emissions/concentrations and their conversion to radiative forcing is validated by our inability to reject a restriction that equalizes the temperature &gt;effect of a change in radiative forcing across gases (7). That same reference &gt;finds that the statistical estimates for the temperature effect of volcanic &gt;sulfates and ENSO (and effects of ENSO on atmospheric CO2 &gt;) are consistent &gt;with estimates derived from climate models and empirical ana 
1	4	Yes, this is why some have suggested purposely putting SO2 into the atmosphere, because it makes light colored particles that block some of the sunlight. The problem is, it also makes acid rain, which is why the European nations were so keen to scrub it out of their smokestacks.  Back in the 1970s and 1980s you used to see pictures all the time of European outdoor marble statues and building facades melting away bit by bit. You don't see that happening any more! Also, forests downwind of coal plants were dying because of the acidity of the rain.  China doesn't have much marble sculpture, I don't think, but they do have forests and farmland susceptible to acid rain, so I expect they'll be trying to clean that stuff up soon. They probably already have laws on the books, they just need to execute a few scofflaws to keep it real.

That doesn't mean climatologists shouldn't still attempt to discover the truth or that they should be ignored for not following a more robust methodology that is not even possible in their field.  It's not that they should be ignored, we just shouldn't spend ten trillion dollars radically restructuring our energy infrastructure because of them.  It would be nice if folks on the political side of things would come up with policy alternatives that are less socially calamatous and have a couple fewer zeroes in the price tag.

-	-	System of units is based on laser interferemeters and clock, which itself depend on the density of vacuum and the speed of light in it. Actually just this value fluctuates wildly due the presence of many tiny invisible particles in the vacuum. The comparison with older prototypes just reveals it.
1	4	My degree is in physics. Thanks to butch123 I am reminded of the [platinum-iridium meter prototypes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prototype_Meter), which are 90% platinum. While these are interesting artifacts, they have never been important in understanding physics, and since 1960 their purpose has [been supplanted by a more reliable measurement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#Standard_wavelength_of_krypton-86_emission).
0	1	You are not answering his question by such a response. It does not help your position to appear unresponsive to a legitimate question.   Your post refers to a number of things, lumped together, that most have not bothered to look into. The Iridium prototype I take it is referring to this: &gt;The iridium standard meter rod will also have to become longer after some time.   The expansion of the Universe does not have an apparent effect on the cooling properties of SO2.  The Sun recently is pulled away from the barycenter of the solar system normally by the gravity of the gas giants. Their positions show an almost regular convergence which determines the distance the sun is pulled away from the solar system center. This quiet period comes after a number of solar cycles that have built over the past half century. The Sun is now NOT pulled away from the center of the system and does not have as many sunspots generated and the reversal of the polarity of the sunspots has been changed. As of now most sunspots show a unipolar nature. This has not been observed before.  Evidence of the start of the next solar cycle should have already occurred at the high latitudes of the Sun. No evidence of the next cycle of the Sun is present.  We are in uncharted territory, the last time this happened was in the Minimums of 200-250 years ago. Magnetic lines of force inside the Sun are not intense and as twisted as a normal cycle. Solar physicists are constantly discarding theory as it proves to be incorrect.   
-	-	China had big problems back in the early 90's before the burning of coal intensified. Part of the problem is that quite a few of the mines supplied high sulfur content coal and China is now a net importer of (primarily Australian) coal. Therefore they do not switch to cleaner sources due to the need for cheap energy. However China is developing a coal to liquid industry which will offer about 2 bbl for each ton of coal. This promises to allow for a cleaner burning fuel source. As long as the price of oil is above about $50.00 per bbl this process is viable. The worldwide coal industry is [massive.](http://www.rwe.com/web/cms/contentblob/77504/data/10070/hard-coal2007.pdf)

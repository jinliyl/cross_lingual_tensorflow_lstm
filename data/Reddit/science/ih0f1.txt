-	-	When did I even imply that?
-	-	I sure would.  If given the chance, I would really do nothing.  My idea of an enjoyable day is sitting in front of the TV or computer with my girlfriend/family.  I hate that I have to go out to work and am looking forward to when I can save enough for retirement.  Probably in 10-15 years.  I would love to travel, but I don't have to be doing something constructive to enjoy myself or my life.  Work is for money, nothing else.
1	8	Yes, it does. Your cells deteriorate over the course of your life, and progressively lose their form and function. Your DNA accumulates defects over time as well, both naturally and due to environmental hazards. Old age can lead to cancer, and in those cases you might say the person died of cancer, but the ultimate cause was old age.
-	-	Did you even watch the movie?  Your car could be transformed into a personal flying vehicle and was affordable enough to have rush hour traffic in the sky lanes. 
-	-	[Ahem](http://www.allcartech.com/news/1062689_terrafugias-flying-car-closer-to-reality-with-dot-approval).   
1	8	There are a few problems with that reasoning.  Firstly people who predicted things like flying cars did it because the idea seemed cool, it was more for entertainment (Most notably Back to the Future and Blade Runner are fictional movies, but heaps of magazines did it to sell copies). They didn't go out and conduct studies of aircraft engine developments and fuel efficiency over time to work out at what point it would be feasible to use them in a car they just said 'antigravity' which wasn't much more descriptive than 'magic' and left it at that.  The other problem is they didn't factor in things like the actual usefulness/demand/feasibility/economics. If you get a fender bender in a flying car, your dead and so is anyone underneath you. Flying is much harder that driving, you would need total computer control. Would flying cars really help cut down short distance commutes when you have to take off and land (even with some kind of VTOL)? For longer distances flying cars aren't so useful as the roads are unlikely to be in much use and there are also airplanes. What about the noise?, all the technologies we have to keep a car up need to exert a downwards force on the air to counteract gravity, imagine a thousand jet planes flying past your office window. All that air would need to be displaced so it's going to be very windy below, you will be pushing on any cars underneath you too. How exactly do you accelerate and turn without any friction? Superconducting magnets could allow for basically 'antigravity' style cars which would get rid of noise/air displacement but don't help with that.  They actually did get quite a few predictions right too. I have seem older predictions of the future for things like an 'atomic cookers' (We have the Microwave Oven without the radiation poison). Refrigeration. People never think about the stuff that was gotten right. If even %30 of the singularity type stuff happens it's going to involve some major changes.  If things don't happen that that will be just as disruptive. For example computers would have to stop getting faster/cheaper/energy efficient which would cause lots of the IT industry to collapse. How would Google support growth if the harddrives don't keep increasing in size. Their data centers would require dedicated nuclear power plants.  Finally people now days are much better at predicting the future. There are more  scientific methods used. There is more data and you can see what the past predictions got wrong and why. There are people who actually have the job title of futurists.
0	2	If anything you said was remotely true, children would still act like two year olds when they aged out of daycare.   Your mind will age, regardless of who you hang out with. 
-	-	So do I! I would rather live for longer and carry on what I do. Maybe have a retirement year every 5-10 years instead of them all bunched at the end.
-	-	The third dimension would actually help that *a lot*, if it weren't for this tiny little problem called gravity. 
-	-	Oh sure, private planes.  Those existed in the 80's. To [quote a similar, and perhaps less sensational, article](http://www.carsdirect.com/car-buying/on-flying-cars-and-deloreans-back-to-the-future---today-and-tomorrow)  &gt;&gt; But unless your office has a runway attached to the parking lot, you aren't going to be able to use this nifty piece of machinery to commute. 
-	-	I would think that anti-biotics would have been the first drug to extand life span in mammals...
-	-	Novartis makes a rapamycin analog that has better oral bioavailability, called afinitor.  It's already being used to treat kidney cancer and tuberous sclerosis.  There are already people who are on this drug long-term as an every day type thing.  It's unfortunate that they all have other health problems, but it might be interesting to follow them with aging-related markers.  Also, rapamycin is a powerful immune suppressant, so this definitely isn't "the answer" to aging.  Although it might be interesting to see if you can take a rapa analog and then immediately stop taking it if you got an infection or something. 
0	1	Shit's expensive as hell, we need to drop the price on this stuff!
-	-	I literally don't think the vast majority of the general public realise just how much things are going to change in the next 20-30 years. Provided we don't blow ourselves up before hand things are going to be remarkably different.
0	1	fuck that the racist, back asswards stupid geezers need to die so that new generations can move civilization forward.
-	-	If they're smart, they'll rush into testing this on cats, dogs, and monkeys simultaniously next.  The monkeys might give us more insight about whether, or not, it will work for humans but cats and dogs are a whole untapped market for them.    Unlike human testing, testing on cats and dogs will have vastly lower costs.  Even if it never works on humans, imagine what cat and dog owners would be willing to spend for a pill that will add 20%+ to the lifespan of their "four legged children".
-	-	very old news, 2009...
0	5	Too bad the drug [causes cancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus#Risk_due_to_immunosuppression).  Also it's used to treat cancer... go figure.  Also the knock off non-brandname version costs $20 a day for 4mg (I don't know what dosage would be used for extending life spans in humans).
-	-	Not really, people lived to 80's-90's before antibiotics, just not many did.  Antibiotics just made a majority of people live to die of old age instead of bacterial disease.
-	-	Would you rather work until you are 200, or work until you are 65 and die at 80?
0	5	sorry, you're wrong.  Please do some research on the coming collapse and educate yourself. 
-	-	And how many of the predictions in Back to the Future turned out to be duds?  Where's my flying car?  
-	-	I tend to think people wouldn't turn into stupid old geezers if they remained young.  Old people get stuck and refuse to accept new ideas but is that because the ideas they stick by where new when they accepted them or because their brain just locks down. They loose mental flexibility and their neurons die off.  I think if you feel young, you will act young. In fact I think you will feel different depending on your body (and I recall there where some experiments involving virtual reality that indicated that. Also more mundane things such as you feel more confident if you are wearing flashy clothes, look better and so on).  Also I think group think would play a large part. If your surrounded by genuine young people embracing new ideas your brain's drive to subconsciously 'believe' in what the herd believes should kick in.
0	2	Unfortunately there are just as many asshats when you look at other age groups. It's not age that is the problem, it's stupidity.  
-	-	I think you need to ask that question to someone who is 79 and 364 days.
-	-	Some of us actually enjoy what we do in life.
-	-	&gt;die of old age  Does not exist.
0	2	Would you, seriously, want to retire at 65 and spend the next ~135 years sitting on your ass doing nothing constructive?  I'd just keep looking around until I found a field I enjoyed working in.
-	-	The fundamental flaw is that people have a hard enough time driving in two dimensions without crashing into things.  Adding another dimension will only make it that much worse.  If we ever get flying cars, I'm going to invest in roofing companies.  
-	-	They are called airplanes. The "future tech" car is the self-driving one.
-	-	Yes and I know there is a theoretical max age for a human(somewhere around 160 if I recall) due to the fact that you stop generating new cells. We don't approach that age where the sole reason for death is age though. If you're making that argument then the ultimate cause was their birth.
1	4	Everybody is different, but most people find that being perpetually unemployed (such as in retirement), eventually, becomes extremely boring.  If you aren't careful, it can lead to depression and/or morbid obesity without realizing it.
-	-	If you found a number for a theoretical max age, I would be extremely suspicious of any scientist who made the claim. We don't know many specifics about what causes aging, so attempts to guess at when these ill-understood effects will ultimately do us all in seem premature.  The generation of new cells has little (if anything) to do with it. New cells are generated through the division of existing cells. The defects are passed on. Little defects accumulate throughout your life, the moment you are born. You can create new cells all you want, but that could just makes things worse, since every time DNA is replicated there's a chance for error.  To add to this, there is a constant low-level inflammation that wears on your systems, gradually over time.  Doctors can be specific and call it various kinds of organ failure, but that is just being specific. You can correctly say somebody who died of a flu died of a virus. For the same reason, you can say that somebody who died of certain kinds of organ failure died of old age. But I don't know how you'd actually be able to figure out if old age caused the problem, or to what extent it contributed, since so many other factors are involved as well. Diet, exercise, how much car exhaust you breathe in, etc.  But yeah, it is kind of a semantic argument. One you started ;)
0	2	To each their own.  I always find things I enjoy.  I don't need to be productive to have fun or enjoyment.  My grandpa has been retired for 30+ years and he always finds things to do.  He always mentions how 'at least I'm not working'.  I just can't understand how someone can enjoy working.
0	2	Oh I thought you were being literal. Yes, I have seen the movie. I have a set of Nike power-laces on pre-order for Jan 1st 2015.

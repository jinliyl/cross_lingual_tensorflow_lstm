0	2	You see what you've done here is unequivocally reveal your monumental stupidity.
0	1	Who axed you computer?
-	-	I say enslickness.  Well, I don't, but I've always wanted to.
-	-	Maybe if *you* were in charge and it was done that way, but moving material 2.5 miles, aqueous or not, is not worth it unless it's a [precious metal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea_mining#Resources_mined).
-	-	&gt;Does the documentary have a title?  Possibly [Azorian: The Raising of the K-129](http://www.amazon.com/Azorian-Raising-K-129-Michael-White/dp/B0047H7PYQ). [There's a trailer available](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h6rGrzD2VY).
0	5	Sorry but Loony Toons tells me different.
1	4	Ice Nine I tell you.  
-	-	All stars are fueled by nuclear fusion. A supernova can only occur to a star that is significantly more massive than our sun.
-	-	Depends on how deep of a zone the turbidity would stretch, really.  Granted you can make a case that you're stirring up things that haven't been in the "open" water for quite some time, and the material in the muck can technically be spread all around the world depending on how it catches the ocean currents.  I'm all for doing extensive tests of what exactly is in the muck, and I'm not trying to make light of the *potential* impacts.  However, to instantly have the knee-jerk reaction that it'll destroy all the life in the oceans, without knowing the make-up of the muck beyond a few interesting elements, is a tad disingenuous. 
-	-	A rational society would hold the continued integrity of our environment as the highest possible reward.
-	-	Also concentration of rare earth's also creates radio active waste 
-	-	The CIA has a long history of impeding deep water mining and exploration. A Finnish company called Rauma-Repola made the revolutionary Mir 1 and Mir 2 submarines in 1987 for the Soviets. They also had grand plans for oceanic mining. I remember seeing their manganese nodule extractor mockup as a child at a science fair.  The Mir submarines are still rather unique and one of them was used to film the Titanic for example. The Russians still use them exclusively for deep ocean research. So what's the CIA got to do with this? Apparently the CIA found the technology such a colossal threat to their underwater interests (fiber optic cables and such) that the Finnish company executives were told to forget their endeavors. The submarine development ceased and the company never built a single submarine after that.  It's true that there are only oral testimonies and rumors about this but this was a very likely scenario considering the Mir submarines were sold to the Soviets which was extra-dangerous to the CIA. The submarines could handle ocean floor depths, remain submerged for long durations and carry advanced robotic tools. 
-	-	I saw a documentary on Azorian and Glomar earlier this year. F'ing wonderful engineering - it was like a black Apollo project. Unfortunately, they scrapped all of the specialized equipment on the ship before they repurposed her. They spend a LOT of money on that project.
-	-	&gt;pick a spot anywhere in the ocean to start diving 2.5 miles down.  FTFY
-	-	I appreciate your impulse to call BS, but you need to think it through more rigorously.  For instance, is there a meaningful change in the state of the compound that would cause it to be more risky to the environment?  I'm pretty sure the answer here is no, since these rare earth elements are typically present as relatively inert oxides and need to be processed (on the surface, I'd imagine) to their metallic form.
0	1	Contaminate the surface with the stuff underneath . . . . Crazy that'll never happen!   Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to take a dip in the gulf of mexico. I mean Yellowstone river.. or fuck it I'll hike on through alberta.  Actually, whatev.. I wasn't using any of that stuff anyhow. It's got Nothing to DO with *MMEEEEEE*
0	1	Unlikely, we know jack shit about the marine life we might be destroying and if companies start exploiting resources there, you can be damn sure any new research in the area will be kept off the table for at least a few years.
-	-	yes, in optical fabrication...
-	-	The plan is to extract the metals using acid leaching right on the ship. It's not just pumping mud through some strainers. It involves lots of nasty chemicals.
-	-	Yeah. Like when we contaminated the Gulf with what's on the floor of the Gulf.
-	-	Not bring back slave labor.  Bring back the argument that without it the "world will collapse."  I doubt those responsible for slave labor are doing so for the greater good.
1	6	5000m deep? might as well be on the moon.  
0	1	Hurry U.S.! 
1	6	I read the headline and knew immediately that it couldn't.  I don't even have to read the article.  Dredging the ocean floor for minerals is fantasy.
-	-	Wow, as an Aussie I never knew Australia was a former Soviet Republic.
-	-	Howard Hughes is calling. He wants his coverup back. 
-	-	I can't find a source for this, but isn't the reason China's REM are so cheap because it's a byproduct of one of their coal mines (in other words, they're a side effect of something they'd do anyways)?
0	1	China: We have all these precious metals! *Nyah nyahhh*  USA: WE GOT MUD, BITCH!
-	-	China supplies 75% of the rare earth metals but only contains 1/3 of the rare earth metal reserves... hmmm
1	8	oceans must be "raped" we know jack about our 70% of planet.   oceans chastity belt must be broken. 
-	-	Lets get the Glomar Explorer out of mothballs!
1	7	THANK GOD!  That is sure a load off of my chest.  I had been stewing about that one for months.
-	-	&gt; Right because nothing could possibly go wrong with this.   You don't need to make it impossible for something to go wrong. You just need a favorable risk/reward ratio.
-	-	But there are plenty of normal terrestrial deposits in other countries than China.  The only reason why China has a monopoly is that they mined and sold their very cheaply, possibly below cost, making competitors in other countries shut down.  Now that China suddenly decided to increase prices, and use these minerals for diplomatic bargaining, other countries are reopening their mines, and China's monopoly will be short-lived.
1	8	Average depth of the Pacific Ocean: about 4100 meters.  So, good luck with that.
-	-	But doesn't that make them rare?
0	1	Right because nothing could possibly go wrong with this. It would be inconceivable that a gang of corner-cutting capitalists would ever, say, contaminate the Pacific ocean with toxic chemicals. Never.
-	-	I thought they may have been rare in the universe-scale (since they require super nova events to form) but then i remembered they were called rare _earth_ elements...
0	2	Sneaky.
-	-	Until then, you can still visit [the set of SeaQuest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seas_with_Nemo_%26_Friends). :)
-	-	They aren't really "rare" in the sense that they are uncommon. They are rare in the sense that they are thinly spread without many heavy concentrations that make them easy to mine.
-	-	The Solar system is a remnant of supernova-type event.
-	-	They are "rare" in the sense that they are not bunched together like deposits of iron, I think.  Their actual availability is the same as most other metals, just spread out over more distance.  This makes them harder to mine.  To mine copper, you just find big hunks of copper and melt it out of the rock.  To mine the "rare earth" elements you have to dig up a whole mountain and boil the whole thing off, or something along those lines.
-	-	Nickel*
-	-	They're rare relative to Iron, sure. There's still plenty of them though. 
-	-	Organic grass fed is the term they use.
-	-	The article states that these minerals have been found 100 feet below the sea bed, nowhere near the continental plates. So it doesn't matter that they're not randomly picking a spot, that spot is going to be on the bottom of the Pacific.  "But a new study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, points to an extraordinary concentration of rare-earth elements in thick mud at great depths on the Pacific floor."  "A bigger question is whether the technology exists for recovering the mud at such great depths -- 4,000 to 5,000 metres (13,000 to 16,250 feet)".
-	-	Perhaps a dyke would come in handy here.
-	-	It's actually the opposite, REE is mined from high grade deposits, copper from very low grade massive deposits. The REE market is much much smaller. Less demand means no one even bothers to explore for it. Billions a year is spent looking for copper.
-	-	Only capitalists are allowed to cut corners.
1	4	Being in an industry that is greatly affected by this, anything that cab loosen China's monopoly on this is good news. 
1	4	Nice Try Japan.
1	4	i like how the headline is supposed to present this as a positive when in reality it should be something more like "get ready to rape the ocean even harder"
-	-	The reason for China's monopoly, as I understand it, isn't because they have more of these minerals. It's because they're just charging less for it than the rest of the world.
-	-	So, great, now the mer-people have a monopoly over rare-earth metals.
-	-	China is not a Monopoly. Malaysia has a mine with 30% capacity of China. The mine is operated by Australians and pollutes the Jungle to the max. Australia has the Rare Earth Minerals too, but their Green Movement is stronger than greed.
1	4	great. Now we just have to dig up the pacific ocean.
1	6	Does something that we can find lying around in mud at the bottom of the sea really count as "hi-tech"? 
-	-	oh great more mining and/or drilling in the ocean  there's no way this could ever go wrong
-	-	hmmmmm.... this seems familiar....
-	-	Rational just means in accordance with reason. It is reasonable to assume that people in 200 years will be just as human as you and I, and will deserve the same rights and privileges and freedoms as you and I. This assumption coupled with the concept of moral obligation obliges us to immediately cease destroying the world of 200 years from now.   It is unreasonable to assume that everything will be fine if we as a culture continue on our present course. It is a dangerous and terrifying dismissal of all reason and logic except a small subset of statistical analysis which is the domain of capitalist reasoning.  
1	4	Thx. That makes sense.
-	-	Wat. Do you even know what you're talking about? [Read up honey.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System)
-	-	Not relative to any of the other elements. They are just more spread out. It is another meaning of the word "rare", just not the commonly used one.
1	4	I have a huge bag of rice.  I take that bag and run through your house throwing rice in all directions.  It's a bitch to pick it up, but its fucking everywhere.
-	-	The very fact that our solar system has a lot of heavy metals like iridium in large abundance implies that a lot of the material that turned into our proto solar system came from supernova remnants.
-	-	The argument that "the world will collapse" isn't because of socio-economic necessity--it's because the tooling and infrastructure has been abandoned outside of the areas that the megaliths of industry deem "profitable."    If there was a serious disruption in Chinese supply of these rare minerals, the advanced technology the world relies on would be non-productible until sufficient exploitation and tooling were implemented in other potentially major sources, i.e. Mountain Pass, CA.    The capitalist leaders deem the potential of disruption too remote of a risk to impinge upon profit in the current sourcing paradigm.    And, just like after the American Civil War, it will take decades to rebuild the economic infrastructure necessary to fully capitalize on the potential capital disrupted.  The US would have attained the position of major world power long before the Spanish-American War had the economic disruptions from the war and subsequent fall of slavery in the south.  While I believe that it was a necessary and just transition--the costs were worth it--the big economic players that were profitting off of the exploitation lost power through the transition.    The same goes for potential costs and consequences of a new shift, the world will be fine, but the current exploiters will not. 
-	-	What do you mean bring it back? it never left. From the construction of Dubai the the diamond mines of Africa, slave labor for low wage in poor working conditions is going strong in the world.
-	-	Ack, my mistake.  Apparently Living Seas was only used for part of one episode of SeaQuest.
-	-	You say contamination, I say non-positive enrichment.
-	-	Glad to hear it :-)  However, we might *need* to dredge the ocean floor (although perhaps not at 2000m).
-	-	This is a piss-poor analogy given that we know, for the most part, nothing lives this far below the ocean's surface.  Obviously more extensive studies would need to be done first to confirm, but as of right now this would have barely the ecological impact as mountain top clearing.
1	4	This line of thread has made me feel infinitely better.
-	-	It would also give us a convenient place for some of the wast from our current reactors as I understand the Molten Salt Thorium reactor can consume this waist quite nicely.
-	-	Ths US are non-party to *any* UN convention they didn't put forward themselves (I think even some they did).
-	-	IMPERIUS REX!
-	-	The California mine that would provide us with plenty of rare earth elements wasn't shut down because it wasn't cost effective, it was shut down because of leaking pollutants from the mine or something like that into groundwater.
-	-	CeO... username: glasspusher  Abrasive in polishing?  (2nd guess: CMP)
-	-	So the ’monopoly’ is really because nobody else bothered to process the stuff. 
-	-	How do you feel about asteroid mining?
0	5	Yea, to bad we don't just build a thorium rector, and you know make electricity with it.
-	-	So there is plenty of core drilling going on on the surface, looking for things.  Though they only look so deep usually since there is a point where to much overburden above your mineral makes the mineral to expensive to mine from the surface, and underground mining is more expensive than that so the value of the ore has to be high enough to justify underground mining.  After you drill and find your mineral, you will need 10 to 20 years to permit your mine, at least if you are in the USA.  The environmentalists have for the last 15 years or so, wiped out the ability for new facilities to permit and open any faster.  In MN there is a (rare earth metal) mine that they want to open, its on year 9 of permitting, and looks like its half way done.  So, if you do drill and find some minerals worth mining, how do you fund your organization for the 10 to 20 years its going to take just to start construction on your facilities, construction on a full fledged mine can take at least 5 good years.  So from discovery you are 15 to 25 years out before you can mine and make income.  Lots of groups that used to do exploratory drilling in the US have started doing it in other countries and regions since they can actually get a mine going and make some money if they find something.
-	-	lol
-	-	I'm glad I'm not the only one whose mind went to Glomar Explorer.  ----  For those who are unaware, in the early 1970s the hotbed of mining research was the collection of [manganese nodules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese_nodule) from the ocean bottom. Manganese, iron, and other metals accumulate into potato-sized balls which litter the deep ocean.   Eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes wanted in on the action, and to do this he needed a massive ship to lower and lift equipment to the seafloor. In 1972, the 600 foot, 50,000 ton Hughes Glomar Explorer was launched.  However, the public story was a lie. In reality, Howard Hughes was providing the cover story for a secret CIA operation, [Project Azorian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Azorian).  In 1968, the soviet submarine K-129 sank in the Pacific Ocean, probably about 600 miles north of Midway. The Soviet Navy never found her. The United States Navy did. Glomar Explorer was built to steal the submarine from the bottom of the ocean.  It is known that during the lift, the capture system failed and two-thirds of K-129 broke off and fell back to the bottom of the ocean. Two nuclear torpedoes were recovered from the remainder of the submarine along with the bodies of six crewmen. What else the CIA recovered remains classified. In the early 1990s, the US quietly gave Russia [video footage of the burial at sea of the recovered sailors](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFWMo7aHDRo).  After Project Azorian, Glomar Explorer was mothballed. In 1978 she was leased to actually do the job she was supposedly built for, testing deep sea mining. In 1997 she was converted to a deep sea drillship, and is currently owned by Transocean.
1	6	rare like diamonds.
-	-	It's almost as if they wouldn't randomly pick a spot anywhere in the ocean to start digging.
-	-	Mountain Pass mine never produced the heavier REEs which the article is about and in which China has a near 100% dominance.
-	-	If china is selling so low why would they want a new supplier? &lt;_&lt;
-	-	I don't see how the invisible hand of the market is paralyzed. They'd like to raise a few hundred million more people out of abject poverty. People in richer countries would like to limit their cancer and other health problems that come from exposure to heavy metals. If I were in China's position I'd choose risky mining, in the US or Europe's positions and I choose higher health standards. It all sounds like the invisible hand is working pretty well.  Really, when you get down to it, I'd probably rather that my child work in a factory making tennis shoes than cleaning chimneys, or working 18 hours a day on a rural farm and still hungry every night. An even better solution is vaccines, birth control, and youth education, but the invisible hand is from economics, the science of decisions. Blanket statements without marginal analysis and context are only impossible with intentional blindness of the choices people face.
-	-	I would think that if this was predictable, the futures market could deal with it.
-	-	It is more than cheap labour for China, it has a lot to do with subsidized power, low environmental regulations and the like.  Most mining operations aren't really things you can just throw manpower at and hope that it comes out cheaper (although some definitely are).  Where the west (or at least western companies) can hope to compete with China is in advanced mining technologies which hopefully reduce your costs.
-	-	They could finance the project.
-	-	That is just about the exact thing I was trying to say, the integrity of the environment matters but that one obscure species of tree frog that isn't a significant part of the food web doesn't matter to a rational society.
0	1	You're just being a dyck.
-	-	Don't forget South American everything, West Virginia coal mines, Eastern European migrant workers......
1	4	There's a subreddit for that? Awesome!
-	-	Fact: every single story about rare earth minerals tries to play on dumb people thinking the name means they are rare.  
0	1	&gt;or fuck it I'll hike on through alberta.  Without specifying the region, this is a ridiculous example. Alberta is around the size of Texas and the vast majority is farmland or forests. You'd have to specifically visit the Fort MacMurray area to see environmental effects from oilsands operations.
-	-	I thought that's what we were doing here. Is that not ok?
-	-	We pay over $2500 per 60 lb bucket of CeO now, as opposed to about $200, less than 2 years ago...  It looks like the price isn't gonna fall anytime soon either...  We'll take it where we can get it...
-	-	To quote someone that has a better way with words than I do,  &gt;True. Total rationality is inhuman. Total rationality is the religion of the psychopath. Total rationality views everything, even human life, along the lines of a risk / reward ratio leading to the accomplishment of greater things. Stalinists are rational. Even Nazi's could be said to be perfectly 'rational'. However, even the most coldly rational society would consider the integrity of the environment, if not the highest value, at least a value to defend.
-	-	Can't wait till we can just grab asteroids, put them into orbit around the planet and mine them.  Just drop the shipments off the side of the asteroid with a massive parachute :)  Would R&amp;D in technology ramp up if REMs were cheaper?
0	5	Sorry, what is the point of your previous two comments in this thread? They have little to no relevance whatsoever. Unless I'm missing some larger point you're trying to make, you appear to just be spitting out random information.
-	-	There are already companies doing sea floor mining. One in South Africa dredges for diamonds. Another mentioned in another reply has done trials, I think.
0	5	Wikipedia is accurate in the sense that we can only speak authoritatively based on evidence we have in hand. There might be concentrated deposits of REE's, and there might be a Porsche 959 in my garage under all those boxes. Given the what we've seen so far, they're sparsely distributed, and my garage contains only boxes of crap. 
-	-	Really...
1	7	Oh, thank you for your extensive analysis and debunking of my statement.  I should have thought things through more thoroughly.  You have surely shown me the error of my ways.
-	-	No I believe that was the irrational capitalist opposers, Go back to /r/trees.
-	-	Google Natulis Minerals, on the Toronto stock exchange. Advanced plans to mine sea floor smokers around Papua New Guinea
-	-	No, I don't so much care about that. I was more concerned with a Chinese monopoly.  edit: Which I know they have currently because of cheap labor. I'm just happy that's not the only major source of rare earths available if push came to shove.
-	-	&gt; Decimation of countless acres of unspoiled underwater habitats  The Pacific Ocean is 40,800,000,000 acres.  Yes, that's four followed by ten decimal places.  I don't think anyone would notice if even a 1,728 sq. miles (that's 1.1 million acres--or 0.000003% of the Pacific's area) were contaminated.
-	-	[deleted]
1	8	Thankfully most of the ocean floor is actually pretty barren.  Most of the life lives in the shallow areas.
-	-	They will dump all the waste off the coast of Somalia and label the fishermen that try to stop as pirates just like they do with the rest of the worlds toxic waste.  Source: http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-you-are-being-lied-to-about-pirates-1225817.html
-	-	You can't find a source because what you are saying is not based in fact 
-	-	No, they're so cheap because they can pay people what we would consider to be slave wages, and they can spend zero dollars on environmental or worker safety considerations. I'm fine with not competing with industrial China if it means we don't pour millions of gallons of industrial waste into our water system "just because".
-	-	My guess: Divers with metal footplates get stuck to giant, sentient neodymium magnets until their air supply runs out.   Then it's easy pickings for the Lovecraftian Hard Drive monster and his new crunchy snacks. 
-	-	Not much (that we know about) lives that far down.  If these metals can be mined just by sending submersible ROVs down to dig in the mud, that's likely to be a lot better for all concerned than the high-impact mining processes that are normally used.  
0	1	So, this is an excuse to fuck up the ocean floor?
0	2	I JUST watched Andromeda Strain again yesterday, freaky.
-	-	This makes me think of diamond and gold blocks in Minecraft, I've been playing too much lately apparently
-	-	Plenty of countries already have rare earths e.g Australia and Brazil. China has a monopoly because they have the processing plants.
-	-	Stripping nutrients from aquatic mud...  Ugly bags of mostly water! We must go back to our wet sand. 
-	-	Finally, we have a tangible reason to build the SeaQuest DSV. Someone get one that.   
1	4	I like this part "would not have any environmental impact so long as the acids are not dumped in the ocean".   The instance they sad that you knew that this is what will happen every 3-6 month if this becomes common practice.  
-	-	They have the processing plants.
0	1	Permit me to call bullshit on this story's premise that China has a monopoly, which is the propaganda implication that is the reason for the article. (ie: "Fear China, peasants!")  There are plenty of rare earth metal mines in the US and other countries. These were shut down because the Chinese government was massively underpricing the metals to gain market share and undermine other operations. Partly this was financed with dollars from the trade imbalance, but also because human life is worthless in China and there are no mining safety standards enforced and wages are nothing, when the workers are paid at all as opposed to being drafted as part of a prison sentence for being a dissident.

0	2	Scumbag resources: appear rare; actually abundant.
-	-	TIL
-	-	Guys like Nautilus have been around for a while.  There are always plans to mine these smokers, but I've yet to see anyone actually reach production, and certainly production of a significant size.  I think its going to happen, but I don't feel we are there yet with the price of copper, etc.  If Nautilus pulls this off I'll be impressed, but I'm not holding my breath.
1	4	Have fun!
1	4	Awesome, we are going to start sucking up the bottom of the ocean, this should go quite well I think.
-	-	We always knew the ocean floor had an abundant amount of resources that could be exploited.  The problem is, it is at the bottom of the ocean.  It would be a huge undertaking just to mine this minerals.  But the United States knew that one day we would mine the sea floor. That is why we are considered a non-party of the UN Law of Sea Convention. 
-	-	Just admit that you're wrong and have no idea what you're talking about and we'll be ok.
1	6	How does this get to the top page Reddit?
-	-	The cold fusion finding could revert the matter-energy balance back to the side of low-tech, but energy hungry solutions, like the classical light bulbs. Because it seems, the amount of energy at Earth is virtually unlimited, but the material resources are limited, until we invest more energy into their mining. And the mining of raw materials destroys the life environment more, than the dissipation of energy.  The rare metals are "rare" due the complex structure of their orbitals, which is able to mimic the chemistry of many other metals at the same moment. From this reason the rare-earth elements are dispersed in Earth mantle more, than the other elements.
1	4	Yeah, dig it up! 
-	-	Floor of the gulf is not the same as miles beneath the floor of the gulf.  
-	-	Rare Earth metals aren't nearly as rare as the name suggests.  The supply has come from China for exactly the reasons you state in part because they keep operating below cost to prevent supply disruptions that might threaten economic growth.  This goes for all varieties of commodities, really.  The Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese, all with large electronics manufacturing centres, are pretty eager to see a supplier outside of China and are aggressively funding exploration efforts in other countries.
1	8	Before China started major production, most of the world's supply of rare earths came from the [Mountain Pass mine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Pass_rare_earth_mine) in between Las Vegas and LA.  We have to give credit to the US and California legislatures.  Several years ago they saw these Chinese restrictions coming and moved to help get Mountain Pass open again.  I haven't seen any news recently, but they're supposed to be resuming mining this year.  The world demand for rare earths is a lot bigger now than the last time that mine was open, so hopefully they'll be able to ramp up production quickly.
-	-	It's also about the processing of them - they are incredibly difficult to process while minimising pollution.  Currently 100% of certain rare earths are processed in China (ie sent there from overseas) - they are so damn dirty that most countries won't process them, it's too hard to meet environmental standards in a cost efficient way - though I believe one of the Australian miners/prospectors was planning to set up a plant in Malaysia.  Lynas or Arafura or the other one.  The problem that blew up a year or so back was that China decided it wouldn't release the processed metals back as metals - even if they had been mined from outside - they would only release them back as finished products:  batteries and so forth.  So miners would essentially lose control over their own products. 
-	-	Yea, that was probably what was leaking into the groundwater now that I think about it.
0	2	Does the documentary have a title?  edit:sorry that wasn't supposed to come of like a dick. 
1	4	Exactly.  And pretty quick the cost is 1000x what it would be to just get REs from China - if you could get it from them at all.    That deep sea cost gets passed down the supply chain to end products, and pretty quick most of the things you thought you couldn't live without that depend on RE (like any Green or high tech) suddenly aren't so necessary, compared to, say, putting food on the table or a roof over your head at inflation ravaged prices you already can't afford.  Or it ends up being cheaper to buy the finished good from a Chinese company which gets the majority of the margin then and still has access to the cheaper domestic source.  This will probably even be the reality when the dollar eventually stops being the world reserve currency.  Net result: US RE-consuming industries gets starved out of existence and China's industries and economy grows (they have most of the supply chain so most of the profit margins at each link stay in-country).    BTW that was part of the plan (China's plan) all along in getting folks to outsource their factories over there. At some point monopolizing both raw materials and manufacturing would squeeze the West completely out of all technological progress and economic gain. It's pretty much how the US became a superpower.  But, who knows, a miracle could occur.
1	4	That's a good point. Digging through water is very difficult, as the hole keeps filling up as soon as you empty it. It's also difficult for workmen to get a good footing on an aqueous surface.

1	8	True. Total rationality is inhuman. Total rationality is the religion of the psychopath.

However, even the most coldly *rational* society would consider the integrity of the environment, if not the *highest* value, at least a value to defend.

0	1	That's insane. That's like saying a rational person wouldn't care about anything that wouldn't harm them this week. That's the behaviour of a junkie, not a rational being.  The problem with obscure tree frogs going extinct is that the trauma being inflicted on the world's ecosystems is not limited to obscure tree frogs and you know it. The oceans are emptying out, we've annihilated more species in 400 years than the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs, we dump radioactive waste into the sea in lead containers and ignore the fact that if anyone's around in 100,000 years that shit will still need to be cleaned up, our agricultural model is completely unsustainable, all of the world's deserts are expanding at rapid rates, climate change has reached a point where we can no longer stop it from happening, there's a patch of floating garbage in the Pacific the size of Texas, and THIS ISN'T ABOUT TREE FROGS. It's about the destructive forces of Capital and the State. 
-	-	Your world view is laughable childish. Reminds me of myself in high school.
-	-	&gt; what happens in international waters?    stays in ~~international~~ waters 
-	-	Breaking up the muck at the bottom will also have environmental effects. The first that comes to mind being an increase in turbidity of the water, which would have a strong impact on the ecosystem.
-	-	By your description, capitalism's method of dealing with risk/reward  situations sounds a lot less insane than demanding that no risks exist before acting, all the while ignoring the reward completely, as you did in your first post. 
-	-	Boil it, mash it, stick it in a stew...
-	-	make up some BS about recuperative properties and sell it to spas and salons 
-	-	Build the world's largest mud castle, that's what.
-	-	The US has lots of rare-earths, but US mining largely shut down because of strict environmental standards.    My impression is that cheap Chinese mining causes prices to drop, then the US and others can't compete and shut down mining, then China can jack up prices.   The inherent delays and the threat of rock-bottom Chinese health standards causes the Invisible Hand of the Market to be paralyzed.  [guardian: us reopening mines](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/26/rare-earth-metals-us); and [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_earth_element#Global_rare_earth_production) 
-	-	Have you ever been "in thick mud at great depths on the Pacific floor"?  Its mostly microbial life down there.
-	-	If I said its barren you'd bitch that there's some life.  If I say pretty barren, implying that there is some life (just not much) you bitch anyway.  Whatever, man.  You know, another thing about the ocean floor is how similar it is everywhere.  There are some different ecosystems here and there but most of it is the same temperature (a couple degrees) and most of it is just flat muck.  The light doesn't vary seasonally (total darkness) and most of the food has been scavenged before it hits the bottom.  Hell, churning up the muck might actually make life more plentiful on the fringes of the dredging area.
-	-	I meant the density of the element per kilogram of rock is "rarified", or so I have been led to believe.  Is that not the case?
-	-	I apologize for omitting the original [Nature article link](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo1185.html) which contains the info I referred to. The press publication indeed doesn't talk about HREEs but the Nature Geosciences article on which it is based specifically mentions that the REY mud also has a high HREE/LREE ratio. The Mountain Pass mine restarting will do very little for the supply of many of the HREEs but it will produce plenty of LREEs. HREEs so far have come almost exclusively from China. The ocean bottom muck seems to be of very high strategic interest.
0	1	MINE ALL THINGS!!!
-	-	Marine sand is pretty valuable, it gets used to fight coastalerosion.  Dredging companies havebeen found stealing the stuff from less monitored places
-	-	It’s the *low paying* jobs. The theory goes: exporting low paying jobs will raise the living standard of poor countries and create high paying jobs here (we would all become professionals – we would need to). Well, at least that was the promoted version. In reality no third world country has seen an increase in living standard for the lower working class (although quite an increase for the upper middle class) and naturally we can’t all be lawyers and dentists. The only real effect is that the rich get richer both here and abroad.   In the future this will be seen as the biggest political folly ever committed.  
1	4	You use this comment sarcastically, but that's essentially the issue.  The US doesn't control the oceans, so if another country wanted to 'rape' their section of ocean, they're free to do just that. The free market is awesome.   
-	-	You forgot free-range.
-	-	Huh? No... because steaks are sometimes served rare... rare, as in rare, medium, well-done.... nevermind.
-	-	Jupiter is thought to be mostly composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane. Its apparent magnitude ranges from -1.6 to -2.94, making it one of the brightest objects in the night sky.
-	-	Sparse earth metals
-	-	just like the damn glitter
-	-	No, we're just going to keep on ordering the finished products direct from China like we always have. 
-	-	Contaminate the pacific with whats on the floor of the Pacific . . . .   Yea. . . 
-	-	I would bet money that within a month after any such operation has started there will reports of it decimating some sort of rare sea-mud dwelling species. 
0	2	This is a piss-poor analogy"| No it is not. 
-	-	I think the more interesting question is not so much about how fertile or barren it is, but rather what impact would damage to that ecosystem do to those around it. Obviously the impact is always non-zero, but perhaps it could be negligible compared to other sorts of mining operations we are already happy enough to run.
1	6	So you admit it's not barren? Difficult to tell from that rant.  And do you accept that the increased turbidity from mining would spread over a vast area? Or does that not fit your denial?
0	2	The capitalist society is like a junkie. Irrational, in denial, suicidal, out of control, unable to cease its destructive practices. To deny this is to live in a laughable childish fantasy. Yourself in high school would have done well to continue questioning the dogma of capital.
-	-	[California](http://cleantechnica.com/2010/12/28/california-to-mine-rare-earth-materials-again/) has a world class deposit of (rare earth elements).  It was our government's attitude that tariffs are bad, and that domestic industries are not worth protecting, that led to China's monopoly on rare earths.  The concept that there is no problem with shipping our jobs to any country that will undercut us on wages baffles me.
-	-	The problem hasn't been that rare earth minerals have been hard to find (they're not that rare, despite the name); it's that China was selling them at really low prices such that it made mining in other locales, such as in Colorado, infeasible. When China decided to withhold shipping rare earth minerals to certain countries, including the U.S. and Japan, it opened the eyes of many that mining for rare earth should resume where it had earlier been abandoned.
-	-	Anyone care to guess to impending, completely avoidable, man-made disaster that will occur if they go hunting for these rare-earth metals?  My guess: Decimation of countless acres of unspoiled underwater habitats for many marine species due to direct and indirect mining operations.
0	1	Well ocean floor, have fun being raped.
1	4	&gt; ...on the *Pacific floor*  This is going to end well. 
-	-	Superconducting magnets, how do they work?
1	8	Flood the market.
-	-	&gt;The material had taken hundreds of millions of years to accumulate, depositing at the rate of less than half a centimetre (0.2 of an inch) per thousand years.  So there's hundreds or thousands of inches of RAE's covering the floor of the Pacific?
-	-	Pacific ocean you say?  There's a reason China's been doing a lot of deep sea exploration.  http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/science/12deepsea.html  http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100706/full/466166a.html
-	-	I thought vast amount of rare-earth minerals were discovered in Afghanistan couple years ago. was it not?
-	-	It's not exploration efforts so much as it is building the facilities and finding cheap enough labor to make it economically viable. This is the same sort of thing that is going on with the Canadian oil sands - the price of the commodity has risen enough to make investments in infrastructure necessary for extraction worthwhile. The reserves have always been there, but nobody has bothered to dig the stuff out of the ground. 
-	-	Citation needed. 
-	-	Oil has some nice initial pressure with which to move the fluid with.  edit: often has some nice pressure.   I imagine oil is more fun to pump than slurry as well. 
-	-	As with some of the other posts on the articles page. I find the disposal of the acid somewhat discomforting. Who would regulate it and where would it be stored? Also since I'm an amateur in the fields of geology and biology, what are the effects of a disaster in which the acid spills into the ocean?
-	-	I'd make it a molten salt reactor as well. Can't really have meltdown trouble when you [design the thing to *start* working when it melts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor). I've also heard that thorium is vastly superior to uranium as nuke fuel, anyway.
1	7	Ha! About the same!  
-	-	Exploration is booming, though, and I know from people who work exploring for REs that a lot of the money is coming from East Asia.  Many of the RE deposits outside of China have been known for a while, however many more significant ones are being discovered now.  A good time to be looking unless, like me, you think that there's a bit of a bubble in this market that could pop if China decides to flood the market.
-	-	well, I do remember swearing fealty to that guy ...
1	8	I think you're confused but I'm not positive on which part.
-	-	The capitalist opposers? Go back to /r/fastcars
-	-	Mostly because they don't trust China to continue selling so low and furthermore right now they aren't really so low (hence the exploration boom in the rest of the world).  The Chinese REE mines will always prioritize sales to Chinese companies at the request of their government so often other electronics companies are left fighting over insufficient exports from China and what little supply exists from elsewhere.
-	-	They are not selling low anymore, before when they had competition they dropped the prices so that they could force they're competition to shut down.
-	-	that is NOT the set of SeaQuest
-	-	The article never mentions anything about that.  It lists three elements by name, and they're all light REEs.  Mountain Pass produces Neodymium and Samarium, the two most useful rare earths.
-	-	Just what the oceans needed.  They weren't quite dead enough but hundreds of underwater mining operations should ensure that they'll be Raid dead in a few short years.
-	-	Rare-earth metals are not rare.
-	-	Regardless of what's in the *muck* itself, drastically changing the turbidity of a water ecosystem is never a good thing. It's not so much a knee jerk reaction as an informed reaction based on all previous cases where we discovered ex post facto that messing around in a water-based ecosystem can have unforeseen consequences.
-	-	No it wouldn't, what's going to happen if some obscure species of tree frog goes extinct overnight? Almost nothing because the one obscure snake that feeds on them has been feeding on the increase of a different tree frog that is now thriving. A rational society wouldn't care about anything that wouldn't harm them within their lifetimes. I don't think you even understand what rational action is.
-	-	Obviously we need to build a 3x3 platform over the water, mine out the single connecting tile, and then when that falls into the ocean, dig down through the center.
1	4	Ladders work quite nicely as well. Plus they give you a way of going up and down.
-	-	I heard you could use reeds too, but I tried it and I ended up accidentally breaking them before I could get any real work done.
0	1	Automated minecarts will work. But for that we need gold. Lots of gold!
-	-	Well, Wikipedia does say the elements are dispersed and economic deposits are rare.    But if we haven't actually spent much money looking for REEs, how much of the stuff is out there cannot be accurately estimated. So the statement on Wikipedia could be correct, or it could be wrong.
0	1	And when lacking pressure, you can inject shit in the well to make up for it.  Injecting water into a metal mine will just blow your pumps.
-	-	And oil is a rather runny and light liquid so you can pump it easily through an underwater pipe to begin with. Trying to pump thick heavy muddy sediment from 12000 feet deep is going to be a nightmare. It will require a lot of force to lift it up through a pipe.
-	-	Not always,  see Venezuela 
-	-	If you're concern is over mining the ocean floor, you don't need to panic yet (although you may yet need to panic one day).  Many types of deposits that exist on land are formed on the ocean floor (like VMS deposits).  There are always companies talking about exploiting the newly formed ore rather than looking for the concealed paleo-deposits that have since been worked on to land by tectonic forces, but I'm not convinced we are anywhere near the price level we'd need for basic commodities to justify that challenging of exploration.  In time, though, as on-land deposits become harder and harder to locate and increasingly expensive to exploit we'll likely see metal prices high enough that perhaps we start going direct to the source.
1	4	Thank you Japan!!!
-	-	and when those are gone, then what?
-	-	There's a new rare earth metal processing factory coming online in Malaysia, and I believe Viet Nam. The old plant in California is being pulled out of moth balls and another plant is proposed for Australia.  The problem with these things is that they produce a lot of radioactive thorium. No one wants that lying around in a holding pond for a few centuries.
1	4	You're right on this. There was a big rare earth mining operation in the California until China came in with rock bottom prices in the 70s (I think).  Now that everyone's noticing the importance of rare earths in high-tech devices, they're looking to re-open that mine. Canada has a rare earth mine in the works in the Northwest Territories as well.
-	-	The monopoly is because China undercut everybody 20 years ago with low wages and the fact that they were dumping the radioactive Thorium into a lake in Baotou, China.
0	5	This will not end well.
-	-	Nah, I'm sure there will be some environmental reason we can't use those Pacific floor resources. 
-	-	Oh, so they found another vessel on the sea floor that they want to raise and need a convenient pretext?
-	-	Hi-Tech, been in the earth for hundreds of millions of years. WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; 
-	-	&gt;guardian: us reopening mines  Wasn't the article only about the one *mine* (singluar) in California?
-	-	Things I've picked up about rare earths;  1) Rare earth elements are quite abundant, the name is something of a misnomer.  2) Processing rare-earth ores into metals makes lots of pollution by-products.  3) Processing is cheaper in China because there are few environmental restrictions and the pollution is just an externality.  4) Most of China's rare earth processing happens in Inner Mongolia, where the environmental impacts are awful.
-	-	Get the Glomar Explorer back on the job.
0	1	RAPE THE OCEANS EVEN MOAR!
-	-	"Pollution" depends on how well it is done, and cal be virtually eliminated, as in most chemical factories. The real problem is Thorium (present in any (heavy) REE ore), as it is current treated as radioactive waste, and you have to treat it like that. Specifically, despite you just dug it out from under ground you cannot put it back in, but have to build double fenced facility and guard it for ever... This does not make any sense but it is the law in the US, 
-	-	You ever been in a ocean?
0	1	&gt; ...pretty barren.  Note weasel word. "Pretty". In other words, it's not.   There is life throughout the ocean - except for maybe dead zones created by humans and their fertiliser run-off - and it's all part of a huge ecosystem. Besides, massive plumes of mud created by mining the ocean floor would travel much further than the immediate zone around the mine. And:  &gt; Lab tests show the deposits can be simply removed by rinsing the mud with diluted acids, a process that takes only a couple of hours and, say the authors, would not have any environmental impact so long as the acids are not dumped in the ocean.  Oh, yeah. Mining company + acid + ocean. There's no way that could ever go wrong. Let's just fucking nuke the planet and get it over with....
-	-	Artisinal Tuscan steak for me, please.
-	-	I think the concern is what to do with all the mud once they've leached the minerals.
-	-	Of course countries can do as they please. My opinions as to whether it's a good or sustainable idea are totally irrelevant (as they should be unless I'm a citizen).  Out of curiosity, what happens in international waters? 
-	-	The US doesn't control the oceans"| You have more aircraft carriers then all other countries combine and the worlds largest navy army and airforce if you don't control the worlds oceans Then who is attacking Somalia's coast guard? (no I won't call them pirates, pirates don't stop polluters and illegal fishing, Coast guards do.)
0	5	Sorry you're getting downvoted by people who seem to think oil beneath the surface is the same as oxides already mixed in with the muck at the bottom (and on the surface of) of the ocean.
1	4	Right. And for capital, virtually any risk is acceptable as long as it doesn't threaten the capacity to turn a profit, and any sufficiently large reward will outweigh any potential risks, which is why capitalism is a dangerously insane destructive force which needs to be eliminated as soon as possible.
-	-	I usually fill the space up with sand, and then dig out in the middle before walling it all in with glass. Or you can just put up a whole bunch of doors everywhere.
1	4	Fuck duke!
-	-	weak troll is weak
0	5	like mountain top removal for coal.  People who think that is a good idea care nothing for anyone.
1	6	I found this interesting, did a quick wiki search, some scrolling and ended up [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_earth_element#Global_rare_earth_production). If I had been feeling a bit lazier, I might have wished someone else had posted a link and saved me the effort, so there you go.
-	-	I take it they are rare, cause everything heavier then iron needs supernova type event to be created? 
1	7	But if we all buy a Prius we'll save the World!
-	-	Exactly, the issue is in the processing/purifying chemical plants, which cost about 1e9 USD a piece, and which went all out of business over decade ago in the US. 
-	-	This top comment is predicated on a fallacy, the reason china produces and sells the majority of the rare earth's is because there deposits in Bayan obo are fucking excellent in grade and tonnage like norilsk for nickel or wittwatersrand for gold or Saudi Arabia for oil. There are others out there that are similar but nothing of the same scale and grade has been discovered anywhere. 
-	-	&gt;But there are plenty of normal terrestrial deposits in other countries than China  "plenty" is relative. Relatively speaking, they're not plentiful or they wouldn't be so expensive. Limestone, iron, aluminum, silica, salt in concentrations profitable to mine are commonly found. Neodymium isn't.   
-	-	The National Geographic published a [short article on rare-earth metals last month](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/06/rare-earth-elements/folger-text).  Some of issues highlighted for the Chinese monopoly and short supply are China keeping vast quantities for itself and other countries decreasing their mining efforts.
1	4	Good points, but I'm really hoping SeaQuest happens in real life.  
-	-	"finding cheap enough labor to make it economically viable"  This is really a nonsensical argument. If your product depends on Chinese slave mine labor in order to sell for a marketable price, then there's not much of a market to begin with. If the items are so valuable, pay the miners who extract the needed materials fair wages in a safe mining environment. The argument that the world will collapse without slave labor used to be unpopular after the Civil War, it's amazing to see so many people trying to bring it back.
0	1	Dragnet the fuck outta that floor yeah!
1	4	That's actually a good marketing ploy. I think we should sell steaks the same way.
-	-	The deepest deepwater rigs are between 5000-8000 ft in seawater, plus then usually another mile through rock. The rock is a more traditional issue, it's the depth of the water that is the main issue. These minerals are between 2-3x as far down as our deepest oil rigs.
-	-	China doesn't actually have a monopoly on rare earths.  Rare earths are found all over the world; China has no special concentration of this resource.  What China has is a monopoly on rare earth *production*.  A lot of countries have stopped mining their own rare earths, since China does it cheaply (thanks to no labor standards, few business regulations, and massive state assistance).  China encourages this situation so it can maintain its monopoly, and thus its influence.  Fortunately for us, China can only be so heavy-handed in its wielding of this influence before countries return to producing rare earths themselves.  It's kind of like how Russia's ability to turn off the gas to Ukraine is a power which limits itself (because people respond to it).
-	-	I think Craig Venter, and a lot of marine biologists will disagree with you on that..  
-	-	This kind of test drilling should be done around the world on land. Now where we find cheap drills to do that, that is the problem. Maybe if the drill was hollow that drills only the outside circle that instead of crushing the center, the center would just be lifted up. This is probably the stupidest idea ever but they could also try simultaneously heating with laser and sandblasting the rock.
-	-	Where was I wrong?
-	-	So much for sea steading in the Pacific to get away from evil nation states.

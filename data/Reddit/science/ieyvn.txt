-	-	No, the issue is that we can't *prove* that it exists. It's completely impossible to know what lies beyond "the edge", but we can know what where the edge lies. Whether the universe is just slightly larger than the observable universe, a trillion times larger, or infinite in size, we don't know.
1	6	Wouldn't that require knowing there is a finite edge to the universe?
-	-	I guess those two would be equivalent terms in this case.  What it really means, though, is that information from outside the observable universe can not ever reach us.
1	6	Creationists say the universe was created with light from distant galaxies *already in transit*.  So, um, yeah...
1	8	Nice catch blanco ni√±o ... too bad your ass just got maaaaathed.
-	-	Does that mean those objects where/are moving faster than the speed of light ?
-	-	more precisely it's centered on the observer. which means that everyone is the center of their own universe.
1	4	I always thought it would be cool to write a sci-fi story where it turns out the earth really *is* the center of the universe, and a whole bunch of theories (like the reason for the Hubble red shift) are just wrong because they're based on us assuming the universe doesn't have a center.
1	8	Unfortunately impossible due to the inviolability of the speed of light.   Plus they'd probably just say "time stamp looks shopped".
-	-	No matter the being, the observers are at the center of what's observable to them.
0	1	No one said there are big crunches, or even a cyclical structure.  No one can say anything about what preceded the big bang.
1	4	Yes. That is the currently accepted theory.
0	1	Well, all the cosmologists I have talked to disagree with you.
0	1	Finite just seems so...odd. I just can't conceive of the big bang happening arbitrarily. But then again, time only started 'ticking' after the space expanded to fill it...mind fuck in progress. 
-	-	Are you suggesting that a space that is sufficiently empty will somehow "rip"? Since "vacuum" is simply the existence of particles and has no real force or effect at all, then yeah, I am pretty certain.  I am as certain about that as I am about many other aspects of science.

1	4	This is a great and fun comment.  Should have more upvotes.
-	-	Yeah, [nothing's really matter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbNymZ7vqY&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=237s).
0	1	Are you calling me.... dense?
-	-	Based on observations, most popular idea among cosmologists is that it is flat (with 2% margin error), open and infinite. 
-	-	&gt; Most astronomers would agree we have a decent estimate of the amount of matter in the universe  Of the *observable* universe, which is a very different thing from the *entire* universe, which may indeed be infinite.
-	-	Based on observation, that universe is open and infinite, and homogeneous, and isotropic.  Edit: Unless the Copernican principle is really wrong, the density of the universe is approximately constant, so the amount of matter should be infinite too.
-	-	But their conditions aren't even possible.  They are using a very strange model of the universe for this calculation.
0	2	I hate when people who have a vague grasp on a subject (and the author is clearly maybe at a high-level/general astropyhsics 101 level) decide to write articles. This leads to great misinformation and because the general population retardedly believes anything from a somewhat technical sounding source, they are now think they know about it, when actually their information is incorrect.  
0	2	The second one was correct, if you are a stickler. 
0	1	Did you just say that 95% of something was my lack of something? So I have 95% of NOT self esteem.
-	-	"Observable universe" is a technical term, it doesn't have anything to do with being observable. For example, we can't observe the centre of the moon, but it's part of the observable universe:  &gt; In Big Bang cosmology, the observable universe consists of the galaxies and other matter that we can in principle observe from Earth in the present day, because light (or other signals) from those objects has had time to reach us since the beginning of the cosmological expansion.  **Edit**: in other words, the observable universe is a sphere around the Earth, with radius (time since big bang in seconds) * (speed of light in vacuum, in metres per second)
0	5	The big bang is kind of observable in multiple ways.  Depending on your definition of observable, photons (as a particle) are unobservable and therefor not relevant to us.
1	4	True. It's a [TimeCube](http://www.timecube.com/).

1	6	Here's a little light reading if the void of space interests you: http://www.amazon.com/Book-Nothing-Vacuums-Origins-Universe/dp/0375420991
0	1	You mean about 0.0000000000000000000042 percent of locker B14 in God's train station contains any matter. 
0	1	I matter!
0	1	You hear that people? You. Are. Very. Unique.
	I don't remember where I read this from, but if atoms weren't mostly comprised of free space, then all the matter in the world put together would be the size of an apple.  
0	1	Doesn't that equation address the growing issue, or did I complete misunderstand?  (I'm genuinely confused, I'm really interested in this stuff, but it blows my mind)
0	1	Before you starting acting snarky towards people, you really should make sure *you* understand the situation correctly.  TIAYIDFAMA is correct, the current popular theory is an open and infinite universe, based on observations such as [WMAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe).
-	-	Nope. 
0	2	Don't listen to the haters. Meaning in existence is whatever you want it to be.
-	-	I think so. Also, infinite and mostly flat seems to be the current popular theory, but I am of the opinion that any answer to this will always be guesswork, as we can't observe it, and can only extrapolate from what we see.
-	-	We have several reasons to believe that the universe is infinite. An infinite universe is consistent with all the observations we've ever made. A finite universe isn't.  Well, every theory we have is just the best fit, so based on your thinking: everything is not truly known; but this won't get you anywhere.

-	-	And we all know God uses base10.
1	4	That theory works great until you consider there might be an absurdly dense block of mass that is lying just outside the observable universe, which just happens to be 5 jillion times larger than the observable universe.
-	-	but it's not constant at all.  The universe is expanding constantly (expressed quantitatively by the hubble parameter), so as more time passes, the ratio of matter to space will get even smaller.  At the time of the big bang, this ratio would be identical to the percentage of matter in the universe, so it's pretty obvious that this isn't a constant.  Just a coincidence. 
0	1	no miscommunication!!  *Edit:  Would "You can't explain that" been a better choice?* 
-	-	A stranger lady? Dude needs to find this girl and marry her.
-	-	The universe is actually larger than age of universe * speed of light. Even the observable universe is larger than that (The universe is about 13 billion years old, but the observable universe is 40-some billion light years across).  The reason this can be is at shortly after the universe started, there was a period of expansion, where the space between particles grew much faster than the speed of light. I might not have a good understanding of what actually happened, so you might want to read about [the expansion of the universe yourself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_\(cosmology\)). But the reason there is an "observable universe" is because there are objects so far away, their light cannot have reached us yet. That's only possible if the distance between them and us increased dramatically at some point.

1	4	[something here]**42** - That's OK.  I knew it, but thank you, science!
0	1	Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought we didn't even know what dark matter is, and I thought that dark matter took up a lot of the universe. Knowing space is infinite, is that to say that only 0.000000etc is really matter? When scientist don't even understand what is matter? Aren't we getting a little ahead of our selves boys? 
-	-	That means that we have less matter to deal with
0	5	I wish someone would count those zeros so I didn't have to.

1	6	Very strange... i couldn't fall asleep last night because i was thinking of this, and today its on the front page
0	2	Nah, I thought it was 50/50. 
-	-	AND I WILL HAVE IT **ALL!**
-	-	Here's a more simple explanation for the observable universe: the hubble captured images of stellar bodies that are 12.9 (or so) billion light years away. That means that the image we are seeing of these stars are really more what they looked like 12.9 years ago (just as light arriving from the sun is 7 mins old when it reaches earth because that is how long it takes for light to travel the distance between the sun and the earth). What is particularly interesting though is that the rapid expanding of there universe is thought to have started around 13.7 billion years ago. If these numbers are correct then, there is a gap of about 800 million years after this so called big bang that remains for the time being outside of the observable universe. With improved telescopes we might just be able to witness the events that unfolded during the big bang! Typing this on my phone so sorry for not fact checking.. 
-	-	Do they mean observable universe?  The universe is open and infinitie, and it contains infinite amount of matter.
0	2	Seems to me that they should have 1. Tried to come up with an estimate of the avg density of matter in the universe, and 2. They should have calculated the % fullness of a part of the universe.  It seems to me that the assumptions about total size and mass of the universe are more likely to be wrong.
0	1	bitch, i'm dark matter
-	-	I recommend scientific notation next time.
1	4	Well, the answer **IS** 42. I say, the author is a genius.
1	6	and the rest doesn't?
1	6	Isn't it also true that atoms are mostly empty space and have no real excuse for having mass at all? DO WE ACTUALLY EXIST AT ALL?
-	-	Then my best friend definitely paid too much for acreage.
-	-	I was only off by 4 zeros.
1	6	Is that proportional to an atom?
0	5	That's a shame, because I fucking love matter.
0	1	This is if you don't condense the matter at all.   You know how an atom is a tiny tiny nucleus and then a vast % of empty space with tiny tiny electrons orbiting? That number in your title assumes they are completely solid .....  So like EARTH in your titles measurement takes up the exact same amount of space as earth does right now and you are not accounting for the fact that 99.99% of Earth is made of nothing.   It's also very hard to account for the warping of space which occurs with mass. A black hole contains a VAST amount of matter, but since it's so close together it collapses and takes up no space. If you did what you actually asked and put the matter in one place it would all form a black hole so it would take up ZERO % of the universe. So should we let black hole singularities count as zero mass because they don't have dimensions? or should we figure out their mass and then calculate as if they were not in gravitational collapse?   Just wondering....  The actual answer to your questions is "we have no fucking idea and talking like we do just makes us sound really stupid"
0	2	What do you think, you're special?
-	-	According to our current understanding, at least.
-	-	How am I supposed to read this. Percentage of space as apposed to its current size?  The question is flawed. Empty space is dictated by the space between matter. This is why the universe is said to have a size at all. To reduce matter to a single clump is to reduce the size of the universe and it would effectively fill 100% of the universe.
-	-	By what measurement of "percent of the universe?" Volume? I thought we decided that most of the inside of any given atom was empty space... this seems like a real tetchy statement.
-	-	If this were r/politics it would be complaining how 99.99% of our attention is going to .0000000000000042% of the universe and the rest is getting left out
0	1	So why do I keep stubbing my toe? 
1	7	But of course, that means that the other 99.9999999999999999999958% is nearly instantly lethal to humans - but of course, it's even worse than that, as much of the space that does contain matter is far too hot, cold, lacking oxygen, gravitationally warped or lethal my other means for human life as well.  This is why I roll my eyes when some people say the universe was made for us...
0	2	Can we write that as 0.42 * 10‚Åª¬≤‚Å∞ for clarity? Thanks.  Counting zeros is tedious :-)
-	-	That's the part that matters.
	How could an infinite universe be compatible with Big Bang theory?  I thought a curved universe was more popular these days.
-	-	Nope, gravity works at the speed of light just like everyone else.  (I prefer to think of it as the "speed of causality" rather than the "speed of light" - light is just one of the several things that move as fast as possible, which is the speed at which information can propagate through the universe.)
-	-	Yes, I suppose I am confusing the two, but they are not that far from each other at this point in time. They'll meet soon enough, and then I'll be right!  (Also, my example is still useful: It just needs to be restated to say that we can't see the secondary effects of things outside the observable universe before we can see them directly, and then they will have entered the observable universe.)
1	8	If the universe is flat, the expansion will not accelerate. If expansion accelerated, the event horizon would move closer with time. However, even without acceleration, you end up with much the same result: Sooner or later everything around you will move out past the static event horizon, except the things that are bound gravitationally to you.  It is a pretty grim prospect.
1	4	The questions you are asking is exactly why it's called a singularity I think. Interesting stuff.
-	-	I think the universe is expanding uniformly, so that the "observable universe" is actually relative to where you are.  Thus, something may not be part of the observable universe if you're standing on Earth, but it would be if you are standing on another planet 20 light years away.    I'm not a cosmologist though, that was just my understanding of it, so I'd love for someone who knows more to either correct me or let me know I'm on the right track.
-	-	&gt; since it assumes a source of existence other than the big bang?  It doesn't. The observable universe, and its boundary, are relative to Earth.
-	-	You can because what is the limit of observation is different in a different part of the universe.  We just can't observe light from beyond that point.
-	-	Sort of.   Remember however that just because things have gone outside of the observable horizon,  does not mean they did not at one point exist within.   We can surely observe effects caused by matter before it left the observable horizon.    
-	-	The velocity of matter / energy has a maximum (c),  however expansion of space does not adhere to this,  as it isn't about energy/matter.   Let us consider point a and point b.    They're not actually moving apart from each other,  their velocity is 0 for the purpose of this.   However, if instead of velocity we move their place on the line x.   We will consider the spaces between x[a] and x[b] as x[n]   so at this point x[a] = x[0]  and x[b] = x[maximum]    so that the end of x is x[b].  for now x[a] = x[0]  and x[b] = x[1]   if we increase x[maximum] by a rate of x[maximum]+1,  eventually this will exceed the speed of light without a violation of c as the maximum velocity,  since b actually has no velocity, rather the space betwen a and b is what is expanding.    Light will never reach us once the expansion exceeds c,  since the space is expanding at such a rate that the light,  while traveling towards us,  can never cross the distance of space over its expansion.      This isn't really the best way to say it,  but without a mouse (mouse keys is no fun) it makes for editing a pain in the ass,  so I'm just being simplistic.
1	4	Yeah.. I only have passing knowledge of cosmology. From what I understand, observable is "in theory observable" but this also counts for things that we infer from other phenomena such as gravitational lensing or microwave background radiation.  So let me propose a thought experiment. Imagine you have a dinner table and on your dinner table is a placemat. Imagine the center of the placemat is earth, and the area of the placemat is the observable universe.  Now imagine a bunch of magnetic marbles all over the table, representing stars and galaxies, some rolling around, attracting, shoving others away. The ones in the placemat are the observable ones in our universe, and the ones outside are out of our view because light hasn't had enough time to travel to the middle of the placemat yet.   However, we do see marbles get pushed around and influenced inside the placemat, by forces outside the placemat. Does this mean the ones outside are "observable" then?
1	8	Ok so for everything to get further apart, I would think the molecules/particles/masses at the edge would have to move out into new unoccupied space. But, for that to happen, there would need to be a void or something where nothing exists for the universe to expand out into. But if it's expanding into something, then the universe has to finite. And if it's infinite, then it still doesn't make sense for it to be able to expand. Hope this makes sense. Writing it while I am really tired. I can give it another show tomorrow if you are confused with what I said.
-	-	Except for the fact that in the English language "constant" has a definition that is synonymous to "continuous". You can't just ignore all definitions for a word because you like some other word better. You can use whatever word you like, but the above poster was not incorrect to use the word "constant".
-	-	wut
1	4	Ultimately yes, you are right.  We assume it is flat based on numerous observations (WMAP) of the known universe, then *almost* all calculations point to the infinite universe. There is little reason against either infinite or finite models.  Probably I should have added "to out best understanding".
-	-	The space between the source and the observer (earth)  is expanding,   so while the light may be approaching us,  the space it must travel through is expanding faster than the speed of light and thus it can never reach us as the space between us and the photons is expanding in such a manner that speed * time &lt; distance for t=0~infinity.
-	-	I guess you are right, if I understand you correctly. It happened "every where" at once because the singularity WAS the entire universe in condensed form right? That also makes me wonder.... "where" was this singularity if it was the universe? How could it exist if it was all there is to existence; that would essentially be like saying it is "no where".
0	1	4.2*10^-21 %. Maybe it's just me but that makes more sense than a shitload of zeroes.  
0	3	alas, matter is also mostly empty space
1	4	Good point.  The question is then, and I don't know the answer, is gravity superluminal?
-	-	I don't think you're right about this. If you were right then the observable (region of the) universe for every point within *our* observable (region of the) universe is the same as ours.   The observable universe is constantly expanding. That "very special photon" emitted just outside the observable universe *will* eventually reach us because our observable universe will eventually grow large enough to include the point where it was emitted.  It sounds like you're confusing the observable universe with the "future visibility limit" mentioned in [this wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#The_universe_versus_the_observable_universe):  &gt; Some parts of the universe may simply be too far away for the light emitted from there at any moment since the Big Bang to have had enough time to reach Earth at present, so these portions of the universe would currently lie outside the observable universe. In the future the light from distant galaxies will have had more time to travel, so some regions not currently observable will become observable in the future. However, due to Hubble's law regions sufficiently distant from us are expanding away from us much faster than the speed of light   &gt; there is a "future visibility limit" beyond which objects will never enter our observable universe at any time in the infinite future, because light emitted by objects outside that limit can never reach points that are expanding away from us at less than the speed of light  and  &gt; This future visibility limit is calculated to be at a comoving distance of 19 billion parsecs (62 billion light years)  (as opposed to the current observable universe's radius of 46 billion light years).
-	-	Remember, at a certain distance space's expansion exceeds the speed of light (this does not violate relativity as expansion is not velocity.).  As such as objects that are observable are currently observed there will be a point when things cease to be observable.    The expansion increases the speed of expansion the further you move away from earth.   
1	8	I am trying to figure out how to type what I am thinking properly... At some point, the accelerated expansion will overtake the speed of light, in which case, beginning with the galaxies on the furthest edges of the universe; there will gradually be less and less matter in the observable region, until it's just our galaxy, in endless night, correct?   Though I suppose, at that point, it would be the remnants of the coalesced local group.  edit: Sorry for the terrible run-on sentence.
0	1	That assumes that the confines of space are finite, which no one really knows.
1	4	Yeah that's what I was thinking.
0	1	Nothing really matters.........anyone can see.

0	1	Hmm. Tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten-thousandths, hundred-thousandths, millionths..    My normal approach is useless here :(
-	-	That depends on what you term "an area containing matter".  What about the fact that atoms are mostly empty.
0	1	0.0000000000000000000041 percent of that is your mom's fat ass.
-	-	This still makes me wonder how our singularity started.  If entropy would build up from all of the big bangs and big crunches, is it still possible that we are one in a FINITE series of expansions and singularities, one of which will end in heat death?
-	-	Space can be warped by matter. With enough gravity it's possible that even 'empty' space can be pulled in. Over trillions of years, the aggregation of matter and the concentration of black holes into a singular mass could happen and may be enough to collapse space until all matter and all space are condensed down into a single point which could lead to another big bang. But we just don't know enough yet to say one thing or another will happen. It's equally as likely that heat death would be a possibility. I'm wouldn't base any assertions on the WMAP measurements, or any other measurements, because the picture you want to paint is far larger than any of the brushes we currently have.
-	-	No, as an exact solution of the Einstein equations, the Schwarzschild solution is completely relativistic. It does make the assumption that everything is static, so no real system can ever become a Schwarzschild black hole, but it can come arbitrary close after a lot of time.
-	-	&gt;heat death  Yeah, we barely get snow these days...
0	1	Why are you saying that its a 'fact' that its open?  I thought that this was still pretty debated and up in the air.

1	6	You're definite and certain there's to be no "Big Rip?"  
1	6	I too consider this to be a worthwhile comment, and am confounded by its manifest lack of upvotes.
0	7	nevertheless, presuming protons decay, last things in the universe left before its all just radiation, dark matter, neutrinos and say stay electrons, will in fact be the larger black holes. And these will have a lot more collisions to grow through before this period. So I'd expect most of the universe will end up in various black holes at some point.  After that, its going to be even more depressing, if that's imaginable ^^
-	-	Just a few decimals off that's all. Still counts.
1	4	You're welcome.

-	-	No. If there is no edge to the universe, there is no edge to the spread of matter either. I.e. At any point you look, there would be a 0.0000000000000000000042% that it be matter rather than not. There is no need for finite bounds.

1	4	Space only exists due to the warping of the vacuum around the matter within. There's no real way to know anything but it's a good theory.
-	-	All that is necessary is a defined beginning for the most recent expansion of the universe (aka big bang) and you have a reasonable bound (age of universe * speed of light).
-	-	If we assume the universe is homogeneous, then it doesn't matter.
-	-	He must have been using a slide rule.
0	1	I was going to say: ["nothing's really matter.  Anyone can see.  Nothing's really matter.  Nothing's really matter, to me."](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbNymZ7vqY&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=237s)
1	6	"Up to order of magnitude, how much of it all matters?"
1	6	What if that matter did form a black hole? How big would the Schwarzchild radius be?  His mass of universe is 1.6*10^60 kg  radius = 2*G*m/c^2 = 2.5*10^17 light years  It would be bigger than the universe itself. Strange. Could it be the fate of the universe to end up as one giant black hole?
-	-	&gt;  Could it be the fate of the universe to end up as one giant black hole?   No.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_Universe
0	1	I don't see "42" anywhere there. It should at least be there as an exponent!  You must have flipped units somewhere. 
-	-	Look into the WMAP measurements and you will find that the universe is in fact open, not closed. We have heat death to look forward to, not big crunch.
-	-	Aren't the effects of gravity also limited by the speed of light, though?  It seems like the Schwarzchild radius makes a simplifying assumption of instantaneous gravity which doesn't apply here.
0	2	Sucking on what? a black hole is a very deep thingie-hole in time-space if all space-time is a black hole, then what is it bending?
-	-	Even if we ignore that the expansion of the universe (not a constant,  it actually increases the further away from the observer,  so while point b may be receding from us at 1/2c,   point c,  further away from us,   could be exceeding at 1.5c,   faster than the speed of light (and as such,  outside our observable horizon)    That being said,  the size of the universe is not a constant,  by any means.   There is no size as far as we can know,   and even if we did know the extent of the universe (if it has finite bounds)  then the space the singularity exists in and swarzchild radius,  would and cannot exceed the size of the universe.      What would be interesting is if the universe was toroidal and not that big,  and somehow the swarzchild radius overlapped with itself.   While this is impossible given what we know,   I wonder what kind of crazy things would happen.
1	6	is rest of it ocean ?
0	1	Holy shit.  Can someone tell me what that is in scientific notation? I am not counting all those zeros.
0	1	Well shit, that's a much *higher* percentage than I would expect.
0	1	Holy Shit! You found the answer. 
0	2	That's retarded.  Most of the universe is permeated by radiation, gravitational influences, etc, from that matter.  It's not empty. 
-	-	Yes but that doesn't mean the rest is truly a void... there are all sorts of waves which are equally as "important" to the universe as matter.
-	-	"Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind- bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space."  Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 
1	6	Does this count all of the space inside of an atom, or is this talking about the space between atoms?
1	6	Since matter has no size, how do you justify this statement?
0	1	I'm Matter and I use Reddit! Woot!
-	-	Except in cases of expansion.   Remember,  c as a maximum velocity only has a concern where energy/matter is considered.   The space between two points can assuredly exceed the speed of light,  since no velocity is considered.   
-	-	It was a cosmic c-section.
-	-	I know this breaks a bunch of formulas we currently use, but there is no reason to so with an absolute notion that light is the limit.
-	-	for now... or the past 2000 years...
-	-	Two common definitions of "constantly" are "continuing without pause or letup; unceasing" and "regularly recurrent; continual; persistent", both of which are correct in this context.
1	6	You guys ever wonder what the universe is expanding into? I mean for it to expand, it must mean there is something outside of the universe, right? But then if there exists something, isn't it part of the universe? The whole idea of the universe expanding is just confusing to me.
0	1	They just fake the math because they have no understanding of physics at the early stages of the universe. Basically they are making it up because the universe would look different if didn't expand rapidly at a certain point according to our current laws of physics we are using. It probably didn't happen at all.
-	-	touche, my wording was really bad, especially considering the point I was making. Intended meaning: the universe is continually expanding.
-	-	Aaaah.  Neat.
1	6	so it's infinite?
-	-	[4.2x10^-21](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.0000000000000000000042)
-	-	Most of our mass comes from quantum fluctuations in empty space. The sum of the mass of three quarks is insignificant compared to the mass of a proton. 
-	-	No. He found the question. Which is, by happy coincidence, the part that we were missing. :-)
1	4	Yes.
-	-	Well, it's certainly made *with* us....  ...if it's all just chemicals and physical reactions, then we are kind of necessary to the process of the whole thing.   I feel less insignificant when I consider it that way. 
0	2	Because you are a drunken spaz who is consumed by self-loathing.
-	-	OP just forgot to add, "if all matter in the universe were collected together at the average density of the sun and were able to keep it at that density without it collapsing into a black hole, ignoring the fact that atoms are mostly empty space." It's all explained in the article, except that last bit.
-	-	You were right up until you started talking about black holes. Black holes are not infinitely small, they actually do take up space. The only requirement is that light cannot escape this massive object.
-	-	You are special only if you make yourself special.
1	4	Well, considering we make up part of the incredibly small number, I'd say "yes."
1	6	Have we actually found any matter? Are the smallest particles even made up of matter, or just something smaller with even more space in between?
1	6	How does this compare to the percentage of empty space in an atom.
-	-	Only 0.0000000000000000000042 percent of the universe contains any matter, and yo mama makes up a 1/3 of it. 
-	-	Pseudoscience at it finest.
-	-	100% by mass
1	6	...by volume?
-	-	Mr. Addams was on to something.
0	1	This article is wrong on a number of levels.  It's conclusion is meaningless.  If you're curious why, ask us in /r/askscience.  
1	6	So the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy was off by only a few decimal points?
-	-	Doesn't this seem slightly arrogant? We don't know the limits of the universe...
-	-	including your body since atoms are also 99.9999999999999999% void.
1	4	Thanks reddit for being so depressing with your facts!
-	-	Downvoted for lack of scientific notation 
-	-	I say the universe should be who it wants to be, because the universe who minds don't matter, and the universe of matter don't mind.

1	4	Matter is awesome. I love matter. 
0	1	...and I still manage to stub my toe on the coffee table every fuck time.  
-	-	I once calculated that, given the average density of the universe and the number of atoms in the human body, we are roughly equivalent in mass to a cube that is 550,000 miles on a side.
-	-	"It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination."    ‚Äî Dwight Schrute
1	4	You might find [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation) useful.
-	-	That's just what Big Vacuum wants you to think.
1	6	So what about past the observable universe? For example gravity from objects just outside the observable space affecting things in the observable universe?
-	-	&gt;Edit: in other words, the observable universe is a sphere around the Earth, with radius (time since big bang in seconds) * (speed of light in vacuum, in metres per second)  You made a (very understandable) mistake here: you must take into account the fact that the universe is expanding, so that objects that are very far now (far beyond the distance you quoted) started out closer.  Taking that fact into account, the radius of the observable universe turns out to be about 46 billion light-years, whereas (time since big bang in seconds) * (speed of light in vacuum, in metres per second) is about 14 billion light-years.  [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe)
0	1	Did you read one theory and assume that was the truth?  Or have you just not read anything in the last 50 years about the state of astrophysics and other cosmological theories?
1	4	Correct, I overstepped by omitting that caveat.  As far as I am aware, any of these answers are still potentially consistent with data:  there is an (in)finite amount of matter and the universe is {infinite and flat | very slightly curved}.  Do you agree?  
0	5	It is a popular idea, but it is only conjecture, and will likely always remain nothing but conjecture.
0	1	If earth can be observed from the edge of its own observable universe (or anything more than 6000 lightyears away) wouldn't that disprove young earth creationism? I've always wondered that about creation science. Seems a simple image from space shoots the whole thing to hell. 
1	6	Would ‚Äúdetectable‚Äù be a suitable substitute for ‚Äúobservable‚Äù?
1	6	Is this similar to the corollary of "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"   eg If light (information) can't reach us from one part of the universe, does it not exist?
-	-	So, as it turns out, Earth IS the center of the universe.
-	-	I guess you could say that the universe . . .  *puts on sunglasses*  . . . doesn't matter.  YEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
-	-	&gt;can not ever reach us.  Is that literal or that it would take a very, very long time before the light reaches earth? In the original quote it said: &gt;those objects has had time to reach us  /n00b
1	4	Nice try, Zaphod.
-	-	Go for it. 
-	-	To further inquire upon your expertise, isn't there a question of whether anything even can exist past the observable universe, since it assumes a source of existence other than the big bang?
1	6	So I am really living in my own private Idaho?
0	1	Get the fuck out of here!
0	5	&gt;I'm genuinely confused  That's understandable.
-	-	Yes it does. This apparent paradox is addressed in the article I linked to.  Nice catch though.
-	-	We have absolutely zero observations that can say anything at all about an infinite universe, as we are limited to observing a finite part of it. The only statements we can ever make with any certainty are those related to the properties of the observable universe.  Any statements made about whatever is outside the observable universe will always be conjecture, by necessity.
-	-	Despite being on Yahoo Answers, this page may help:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110308131300AA7st29 
-	-	I think you have the common misconception that there is such thing as the center of the big bang, where it originated. It happened everywhere at the same time, and after the big bang the universe (the space itself) started to expand. The speed of light times the time since the big bang defines the observable universe.  So the big bang happened everywhere at the same time, it also happened at the edge of the observable universe.
-	-	As I understand it, objects outside of the observable universe would appear to expand away from the earth at a rate faster than light, thus, the light from those objects "appears" further away than its source location over time.
0	5	Actually, I was a little bit confused there: There are two borders: The edge of the observable universe, which is the distance from which light can possibly have reached us during the age of the universe. This border gets bigger with time, as obviously the more time there has been since the birth of the universe, the more light will have time to reach us.  The second border is the cosmic event horizon. This is the point where if light is emitted, it will never reach us, because the expansion of space will prevent it from ever getting to us. As it travels, space expand as fast or faster than it can get closer to us, and thus it never reaches us. This border is somewhat further out than the edge of the observable universe.  So light that is emitted between these two borders will reach us eventually, but can not have reached us already. Light emitted outside both will never reach us, ever.
-	-	No, even though the limit of observation is different, you can not do this.  Consider this: A very special photon is emitted just outside of the observable universe. On Planet X, halfway between us and the edge of the observable universe, this photon will one day be detected, because it is inside their observable universe. One they do, they will send us a message because they think we might be interested to know that they have observed the very special photon.  However, their message will of course reach us slightly later than the very special photon would have. ~~And since we know the very special photon can not reach us, we also know their message that they have observed it can not reach us, either.~~  *Edit:* To state this more correctly, we can not receive the message about the very special photon until we can observe the very special photon directly. In other words, by the time we get the message, the part of the universe that emitted the photon has entered the expanding sphere of the observable universe.  Sooner or later the expanding sphere of the observable universe will run into the expansion of the universe, and can not expand any further, and that will put an upper limit on how far the observable universe will grow.
1	4	I guess people hold the idea of FTL very dear to their hearts.
0	5	Sorry, I meant: "in mathematics, continuous and constant have different meanings [that are not the same as monotonic]." In mathematics these words are *not* synonymous.  We are dealing with astrophysics, after all. There are reasons why mathematical language is used to describe science: little ambiguity and few if any real synonyms.
-	-	We're talking about the "observable" universe.
-	-	I suggest you spend a few bucks on a physics book, perhaps Bryan Green, since he brings it down to the masses to comprehend.  This is so out-dated that it makes my head explode. Which theory exactly are you referencing?  Many of the theories show us as a limited universe, even colliding with braneworlds, which initiated the "big bang".  I know of far fewer inifinite universe theories than finite ones.  
-	-	&gt; Probably I should have added "to out best understanding".  Yes, that was my main issue. A flat, infinite universe is a nice a simple model that explains our observable part of the universe well, but we are really just guessing about the parts beyond the observable. We're just applying Occam's razor when we don't have enough data to know for sure.  For all we know, the universe could stop right outside the edge of what is observable, or it could change completely. That would be a very strange universe, so we assume this is not the case, but while assuming that things are simple is often useful, it is not necessarily correct. 
1	4	Thank you.
0	1	And most of that mass is your mother! *zing*
0	1	so what 
0	2	Nobody cares.
0	2	Yes, but that's a stupid measure since the sun is mostly filled with the empty space between electrons and nuclei. I'd use neutron or quark star density.
0	2	Surprisingly uninteresting considering only about 10% of an atom is 'matter' anyway so where there is 100% matter there is at most 10% matter, and in between the 10% matter clusters of planets and very thin gas clouds is a huge expanse of vacuum which is pretty much 0% matter. So thinking about it, it's no huge surprise!
-	-	Way to make me feel like I DON'T matter in the scheme of all things. 
-	-	i expect some christian to come up and say and only 1 rock with life on it!
1	6	If you mean volume wise, 0% of the universe contains matter since matter are just points with fields of force around them. If you mean mass wise, well 100% of the matter of the universe makes up the universe. What exactly is the guidelines for determining this percentage?
1	6	so... you're saying there's a chance?!?
-	-	We should just round this to the nearest integer... Yes, that will do..  0% of the universe contains matter.  Zero is a round number.  Edit: Me fail math?? that's unpossible.
-	-	If you were anymore dense you would have your own event horizon.
-	-	Anyone can see...
-	-	Look, I realize that game quotes are sort of our thing here on the internet, but I think I speak for a few people when I say that keeping them to a tasteful minimum would be ideal. 
0	1	what he meant was 41/42 however what he wrote is much smaller, yes that much smaller ammount is still much larger than the earth so mama is still fat  did i just joke explain a joke explanation?  
-	-	Everytime I wonder "Why the fuck did I go to RIT?", I remember where this is hosted
-	-	My thought process when clicking that link:  "Hmm, nothing is happening. Still, nothing is happening. I wonder if**YEEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!**"
-	-	There is a finite edge to the *observable* universe. This is well known, and is what they are using, although they failed to properly explain this.  How much universe there is outside what is observable is unknown, and might or might not be infinite, but it does not really matter for us, as it is, well, unobservable.
-	-	Life, the universe, and everything.
-	-	question about this calculation, is it considering an atom as a solid object? Like is the earth a solid or is it mostly empty space since electrons are still so far apart from eachother. 
0	1	0.0000000000000000000041 of that matter is my dick
1	6	is there something wrong with using exponents? 42 * 10^-22
0	1	vaginas
-	-	Isn't matter an illusion altogether? Matter is energy in a certain configuration, is it not?  Sometimes I find it useful to think of the Universe as a pond with water ripples that have interference patterns of increasing complexity, some of which we have come to understand as 'matter'. That's not very scientific, but it's a decent enough analogy if you want to see the Universe as one large fabric we're all part of.
0	1	Scumbag God.
-	-	The rest is anti-matter I think.
0	1	That's bullshit. The entire universe is matter. Just in many forms. Just because we can't imagine or define it doesn't mean it is not there.  I scoff at this report. SCOFF I say!!!
-	-	But what is that as percentage by mass?
-	-	&gt;The whole idea of the universe expanding is just confusing to me.   That's just because you don't understand what exactly is "expanding".  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space#Overview_of_metrics http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Raisinbread.gif http://www.einstein-online.info/images/elementary/expansion1.gif  
-	-	Yes, but [adverbs of frequency are put after "to be"/the first auxilliary verb and before the main verb](http://esl.about.com/library/grammar/blgr_adverbs_frequency.htm), so it should be "The universe is constantly expanding", otherwise you're putting (undue) emphasis on the "constantly", implying its constant nature.
-	-	Mathematicians use: monotonically increasing. Constant and continuous both mean different things.
-	-	There is immense reason to assume that the speed of causality is limited and equal to the speed of light. There is also pretty much zero reason to doubt this, other than wishful thinking.  *Edit:* I don't really appreciate being downvoted for explaining the scientific understanding of the universe. If you have a problem with it, please speak up.
0	1	NO, WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW IS THE ABSOLUTE AND ONLY TRUTH IN THE UNIVERSE
-	-	I have a feeling we are more in agreement.  I was showing, in a satirical way, that things that are only indirectly observable (most of physics), are relevant.  Your talking about drift right?  Yeah, that's relevant.
-	-	By definition, we can not observe things outside the observable universe affecting things inside the observable universe, because that is the same as observation. Things outside the observable universe *do* affect things inside, but we will never see those things happen.
-	-	In the same way a dim lamp in a dark space makes it the centre of the room.  No, this isn't an issue of geocentrism nor our hubris, this is a matter of the universe being *very* slow to show us what's behind the curtain.  
0	1	Fuck everything about the degenerate era...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Ages_of_the_Universe
-	-	Yes, as far as we can tell.
-	-	They do, but your second line there is not known to be true.
-	-	Where do you get that it contains an infinite amount of matter?  Most astronomers would agree we have a decent estimate of the amount of matter in the universe (just sticking to baryonic matter for now) and it's finite.
1	7	Ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygod!  I'M IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE.   YEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWW
1	4	So long, and thanks for all the fish.
-	-	I think in this study they compressed the electrons right up against the nucleus. and made all the nuclei touch.  Which is quite arbitrary, and has no scientific relevance.  They pretty much said "If the entire OBSERVABLE (a part which the never actually mentioned) universe was the density of a neutron star, how big would it be in comparison?"
-	-	Use lots of lube.  It'll fit.
-	-	That statement can be applied to everything any scientist has ever said ever. It's a little redundant.
-	-	No it doesn't, it's just an anomaly, carry on not mattering. 
-	-	CLOSED AND BOUNDED.   HAVE AT YE!
-	-	The answer is correct. If you read the article they give the conditions for their answer to be correct.
-	-	&gt;expanding constantly  No it's not. It's expanding exponentially. 
1	6	Ring or Sphere?
-	-	That's why it's called SPACE.
0	2	No, unobservable, period. Information from outside the observable universe can not reach us, no matter how long we wait.
-	-	Incorrect.
0	2	No, unobservable, period. It is outside the range where information could have propagated to us. It is not a question of inability, it s a question of that information not existing to observe in any form.
-	-	[deleted]
-	-	You're correct. I didn't include inflation, as I've never particularly understood exactly what was going on there. Just as well, I didn't know how well established it is, because I have come across different theories not long ago, and I think some fellow grad students were even working on them.  It seems most of the inflationary models do agree on a lot of things though.  Anyway, I was just demonstrating a simple approximation that is roughly accurate, qualitatively.  
-	-	Any sort of faster than light reference frame introduces all sorts of problems that violate causality.  Basically, FTL is functionally equivalent to time travel.
-	-	That is relevant on more than one level.
-	-	&gt; I might not have a good understanding of what actually happened, so you might want to read about the expansion of the universe yourself. But the reason there is an "observable universe" is because there are objects so far away, their light cannot have reached us yet.  Scalar field. Apply a multiplier at every point in space and it will add up to expansion faster than light. Particles themselves aren't moving, they're being moved ofc and every point is the "centre". The hyperexpansion part is interesting though and I haven't seen a good explanation as to why it was limited, and why it happened when it did. Perhaps someone knowledgeable can break this down or correct the question even.
-	-	Thus the answer to the question 'what is the question for this answer'. 
-	-	**Science.**
1	7	Thank you!!!!
1	8	Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes!
-	-	Yet correct and relevant.
-	-	Nope. 
-	-	According to modern understanding they form singularities. The event horizon is larger, but all the mass is in a point at the center. The vent horizon is the area from which light can not escape the gravity. The mass is all in the singularity taking up no space.   I happen to disagree with the idea that singularities are real; but this is how modern science views black holes. The mass takes up no space. It's a point. The "black hole" itself can be said to reach to the edge of the singularity but 100% of the area is empty and all the mass takes up no volume at all.   I do disagree that singularities exist, but I actually just envision black holes center of mass as APPROACHING being a singularity; meaning it is infinitely close to being a point, it really has no bearing on the point I was trying to make. Mass takes up different volumes of space depending on the conditions it is in. At any moment the mass of the universe takes up DIFFERENT volumes of space from any other moment, depending on how much is in black holes at any given time. 
1	5	Sadly, no... According to Life, Universe and Everything; if somebody solves the universe (by knowing the answer *and* the question same time) the universe collides and forms something more complex. It has happened before.
-	-	No, they pretty much said,   &gt;if you actually did move all of the mass of the universe into one corner -- it would condense instantly into a black hole and potentially ignite another big bang. But let's say that you could keep it from doing that, and you were somehow able to keep all of the mass evenly distributed at the density of the sun. According to "Magnitudes of Physics", the density of the sun is about 1,410 kilograms per cubic meter.   *[Neutron stars have overall densities predicted by the APR EOS of 3.7√ó1017 to 5.9√ó1017  kg/m3 \(2.6√ó1014 to 4.1√ó1014 times the density of the Sun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star)
-	-	&gt; That's the part that **matters.**
-	-	yeah that's why they call it space. 
-	-	Does that mean it doesn't matter.
0	1	maybe we're just matter-biased. non-matter is important too!
-	-	4.2*10^-21 / its easier on the eyes and so you don't have to count
-	-	I did not know the universe had corners.
1	6	Isn't this number changing constantly if the universe is expanding?
-	-	42...
-	-	Would that be 4.2 _octillionths_ or have I made an error somewhere?
0	2	&gt; all of the mass evenly distributed at the density of the sun.  The number is meaningless without that ^ bit of information.  &gt;it would condense instantly into a black hole and potentially ignite another big bang  PHYSICS DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY!Ôªø GOOD NIGHT!
-	-	"The first question is, "How big is the universe?" No one knows, but this Question of the Day assumes that the universe is a cube that is 30 billion light years on each side."  A CUBE? WHY?  Everything is based in circles in this universe. Atoms, cells, planets... etc. Not on cubes...
1	7	Thank you science. Because I didn't feel too small enough.
1	3	**tl;dr** Universe, you scary!
-	-	Well on the one hand, aren't all the elementary particles point particles?  Therefore, if we're only talking about electrons and quarks and such, which individually occupy zero volume, wouldn't the universe be completely empty?  But on the other hand, knowing that the elementary particles are actually quantum mechanical waveforms that theoretically penetrate the entire universe (albeit at undetectably low levels of "probability") wouldn't the universe be 100% full?
-	-	I have also seen this TV show.
-	-	Jee, did reddit just read my mind ?!?  I've been thinking this all day long:  Reality consists of vacuum. What we experience here on planet Earth on a daily basis is a glaring deviation from reality.
-	-	Tell me again how it's fine-tuned for life to arise.
-	-	Yet when you step outside, somewhere in space there is a star that is directly above your head. Weird to think about.
-	-	Space can also neither be created nor destroyed....right? It can only be fortified. 
-	-	We should just call it 'space'. 
-	-	Bookmarked.
0	2	Suddenly my penis feels statistically huge.
-	-	No matter.
-	-	I always thought when they used the term "singularity", they just meant it had no other definable property, no that it was actually a zero point. Perhaps my understanding is wrong, but my brain does not allow such a thing to exist. Very cool we both see this the same way.  I have another theory that all particles must be bound to some partition of space-time. This isn't exactly the same as ether, but that space is finite and a consequence of matter is using space.

-	-	That is equally 'stupid' and arbitrary.  A neutron star is dense, but far from maximally dense due to quark-quark separation. A quark star is not only theoretical but does not represent a theoretical maximum of density.  Fundamental particles are predicted to be 0 or 1-dimensional, anyway.  edit: or 2-D. Can't forget the 2-branes.
1	4	haha, I'm glad someone has noticed that Star Wars has influenced my discourse :P 
0	1	Son, if you don't answer the question I am afraid that we are going to have to gag you.
-	-	Yes, You see the answer is 42. The question to the answer is, as this chap claims, "What percent of the universe contains matter?" See? he has the question to the answer 42, and the question was the part that the Earth Mk1 got blown up right before it finished calculating, so we didn't have it.
-	-	Unobservable directly with our current methods, its projection upon our visible universe will hopefully become clearer over time.
-	-	Unobservable... *for now.*
-	-	It is known.
-	-	Though for some reason they've decided to assume the observable universe is a cube, which is certainly not the case.
-	-	I don't get that though. By that logic isn't the big bang also unobservable, and therefore not really matter for us?
-	-	But then it wouldn't be as "shocking" and of course wouldn't get as many upvotes.
-	-	If you are writing this I'm going to assume at least 95% of what's left is your lack of self esteem that leads you to write this.
0	2	Did you even read the article? Seriously, it took like 3 minutes. 
-	-	&gt; If you move all the matter into one place wouldn't you create a black hole?  Yes and no. No in this case, since he specified the same density as the sun. A black hole would only form if the density was super-high.
0	2	42x10^-22 %  or   4.2x10^-21 % if you are a stickler.
-	-	Consider what percentage of the universe contains the human race, and then consider what percentage of the universe contains you.
-	-	The physicist and Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg notes, "solar systems and galaxies are not expanding, and space itself is not expanding." Rather, the galaxies are rushing apart. It is all something of a challenge to intuition.
-	-	This thread inspired some research. [This page](http://www.desy.de/user/projects/Physics/Relativity/GR/centre.html), for example, was helpful in explaining to me that there is no universal center, it's all expanding uniformly, it's homogenous, and therefore we can't extrapolate a supposed size from some sort of central point. TIL!
1	6	So, the ultimate answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything, 42, is actually...
-	-	A few reasons I think the answer is wrong  1)The size of the observable universe is constantly increasing  2)The size of the universe is unkown but it is something between infinite and the size of the OU  3)It's impossible to consider the size of sub atomic particles as they all have infinitely big spheres of potential influence
-	-	With a majority like that one may think nothing matters more than something.
-	-	It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.

-	-	By the reasoning in the article, [since all matter is made of fundamental particles, and all fundamental particles are point particles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle) I can reduce this to 0% of the universe contains any matter.
1	4	Yep. There's a lot of space out there.
-	-	If you move all the matter into one place wouldn't you create a black hole? And also wouldn't concentrating the universe into one point make it 100% matter? (or 0%?)
-	-	Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind- bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space. -DNA
-	-	scientific notation please.
0	1	Little known fact, about .00000000000000000000041 is comprised of my penis.
0	1	Which has lead some to say, "And since there's so little you can take the m out of E=mc^2 which means that all energy is just light!"  [I wish I was kidding.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_y4-z-kDqQ)
0	2	Wow...  How is this out-dated? So tell me what is not out-dated then? What is the general opinion among cosmologists?  
-	-	I'm really not sure what you are referring to here. A flat, infinite universe is pretty much the current popular model for the universe.  Have *you* read anything *beyond* popular science books?
-	-	that figure gets even more depressing when you consider how little of that matter is beer.
-	-	If the nucleus of an atom was scaled up to the size of a small marble, then the electrons would be thinner than a human hair and orbit with a radius of TWO MILES. The rest of the atom is empty space.
-	-	whats crazy is look at tht 0.0000000000000000000042% of the universe that contains matter and you will see an equally impressive number about just how empty that solid matter really is.  the universe is as close to nothing as to make odds.
-	-	there it is, 42. 
1	6	I was more surprised by the "the universe is a cube that is 30 billion light years on each side."  How long has this idea been around and is there a lot of stuff to support it?  It just doesn't seem...  Right.
-	-	Spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace. 
-	-	The answer *really* is 42!
-	-	Just like a creationist's brain. 
-	-	Not using scientific notation is amateur mode. 
1	6	I thought there was A LOT of "dark matter" though? Hmm
0	2	Damn nature, you lazy

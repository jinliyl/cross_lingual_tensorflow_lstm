-	-	Check out the episode of Radiolab related to antimatter. http://www.radiolab.org/2011/apr/18/
1	6	I like the ductape around the extremely precise and highly sophisticated trap.  Interesting stuff though.
1	8	Not sure if you're serious or not, but that wouldn't make a difference. Since matter &amp; antimatter are indistinguishable in everything but charge (protons have positive charge, and antiprotons have negative charge but same mass/ basic properties). Since both are indistinguishable from each other, we are composed of antimatter's antimatter, it's all relative to the object composed of either antimatter/ matter.  I hope that clears it up a bit for you. 
1	6	Maybe there's more antimatter than matter and we're all made of antimatter.
-	-	I can't decide if you guys are mirthless or humorless.
-	-	Well... they're not completely indistinguishable. For one, we can observe all this matter, but hardly any anti-matter. But which is matter and which is anti- is completely arbitrary, of course.
0	5	A laudable quality, but it is a shame that it can not be extended  to descriptions of your *experimental technique*! &lt;/Wernstrom&gt;
0	1	I'll have you know that I am neither mirthful nor humorous! &lt;/Farnsworth&gt;
-	-	Wernstrom! &lt;/Farnsworth&gt;

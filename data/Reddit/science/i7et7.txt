0	5	you are simply too informed for this post then. Sorry for slowing you down on your quest to know all
1	4	Funny story: I created a facebook event page for an end of the world party on Dec 20th, 2012 and I got tons of feedback from people saying I shouldn't joke about it because it could be true 0_o  Also: http://www.realitysandwich.com/  Lots of 2012 talk going on there and some of them are big names.
-	-	I stand corrected in definition. However, in a group of unique "things", one that is 1/1000 is less unique than something that is 1/1,000,000...
1	4	Thank you. Madagent and I will take your appology into consideration. 
0	1	Who is seriously upholding it to be true?
1	6	They thought of that. The bearings will be non-lubricated high-quality ceramics. Ceramics, being stable oxides, can last easily for 10000 years (or 10 billion years if there was no wear).
1	7	when i read this post title i thought back to eno's autobiography [a year with swollen appencides](http://www.amazon.com/Year-Swollen-Appendices-Brian-Diary/dp/0571179959) and wondered if this was the millennium clock he wrote of.  i remember when i read it back in 1998 i thought, "this is the silliest idea i've ever heard, it will never get off the ground."   you win this round, brian eno. 
-	-	There are no degrees of uniqueness. If something's unique, there's only one of it. By definition.
1	4	Yikes. Nevertheless that site has an interesting 'intellectual hippie BS' vibe that has me entertained.
1	4	Hari Seldon would be proud.
-	-	Of course the inevitable result will be people ten thousand years from now being convinced the world will end when the clock runs down.
1	6	Brian Eno is part of this.  I went to a talk by himin Liverpool a few years ago and he mentioned the Long Now Foundation and the clock.  A guy thought he had come a to gig and about 5 minutes into the talk he got up, announced "I didn't expect THIS!" and marched out much to Mr Eno's amusment.
1	6	That's really cool and it stands by itself as an art piece let alone a working device, but I find it rather hard to believe all those clockwork pieces will still be functioning 10 millenia from now.
-	-	You lost the bet. 
1	6	"Most" unique?
-	-	Steampunk will live on long after we are gone
-	-	I want that as a watch...seriously how cool would that be?
1	4	The Long Now Foundation was established in 1996 as an attempt to counterbalance the short-term, speed-obsessed nature of modern culture.  There have been a few stories about it since then, but it is still good to know about.
1	6	Saw the prototype clock in the London Museum a few years back and fell in love with it and the foundation.  Been following these guys for the last couple of years.  Such a fascinating thing and idea.  They have a [youtube channel with a couple of relevant videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN-GCSnQkWE&amp;feature=channel_video_title) and there is a [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/stewart_brand_on_the_long_now.html).
1	6	Isn't the Long Now Foundation headquartered in California?  (At least that's where the SALT talks happen)  Why is the clock in Texas?
0	2	&gt;It will be powered by a thermoelectric generator, which will create electricity from the difference in temperature between the sunny outdoors, and the cool interior of the cave.   Does that me it will stop during the impending nuclear winter of 2156? What a shame.
0	1	I wish there were more people actively calling bullshit on the 2012 nonsense.
-	-	Either that, or the Decamillenarians get to leave their concent for apert.
-	-	I thought you were joking at first, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised that Eno would be into something like this.
-	-	they actual pieces will probably be air-tight. not sure how long the bearings would last though
1	4	Yeah, I was thinking a clock also; since I read about this last week.
0	1	Not sure what you're trying to say here, but I did say "one of the most unique". I believe there are degrees of uniqueness, no? some things are plain, and some are special. Some things are 200' tall clocks in a cave.  
1	4	It was a good book.
0	2	everything is bigger in texas... duh

-	-	There are other countries?
0	5	Sounds like a disease to me. As time goes on you become more frail, become more susceptible to diseases, lose mobility in limbs and your mind begins to decay. It's a pretty horrific disease. 
-	-	That's what the first couple comments always are on most /r/science posts.
1	8	Yes, because we are progressing very rapidly in space exploration right now.   Republicans now will keep cutting the space budget so they can get the taxes removed from their bio-cores that keep them alive.   
-	-	You realise there are more countries interested in space than just America right? 
-	-	Attention all non-scientist on reddit about the advancement of science into workable technology (a general guideline, there are exceptions):   1.) anything that is 25 years away means that it is so far away we don't have a fucking clue how to do it, please give us money.  2.) anything that is 10 years away will remain 10 years away for **at least** the next 20 years until it is suddenly 5 years away.  Please, give us money.  3.) anything that is 5 years away is at least 10 years away.  Please give us money.  4.) anything that is 'within the next year' is 5 years away.  Please give us money.  5.) anything that is 'within the next month' is totally ready to go, but we need to drum up interest so you will please give us money.  6.) "by the end of the century" = "BWAAAHAHAHAAAAHAHAHAHAHAAA...YEAH, RIGHT!  Please give us money."
-	-	I've been hearing this same announcement every 25 years for the last 530 years...
0	1	So said Nathan Shock, Bernard Strehler, Benjamin Frank, Johan Bjorksten, Roy Walford. Where are they now? All dead.  http://chronopause.com/index.php/2011/05/30/going-going-gone/
-	-	With a margin of error of +/- 750 years.....
0	1	I'll already be old! I wanna hear about age reversal, yeah?
-	-	Sensationalist headlines do not fare well in /r/science.
1	4	great!  now how about those Suicide Booths? 
-	-	Wouldn't anti-aging science completely destroy the way everything was currently set up? Imagine if generations of politicians never grew old and died. Imagine if the people who voted those people in never went away.   It would be terrible to live in a world where I knew the same crap would truly happen for the rest of my life, instead of for most of it. 
-	-	Right after we buy our flying cars... -.-
-	-	I hope they don't make it compulsory.
0	5	first - we already have too many bunnies  and not enough lettuce, second - I don't want the world run by trillionare immortal psychopaths.  This poses a quandary.
0	5	I thought that global warming will kill us in 25 years ... :-/
-	-	didn't know aging was a disease 
1	8	Great, that means I almost certainly have 24 years of life left
-	-	Not too likely to be -750 years, though.
1	4	I had a good laugh at this. Cheers.
-	-	You realise this would allow the human race to go anywhere it wanted, right? Free of the shackles of time; space is very, very big remember. 
-	-	Most of the time I'm finding myself de-sensationalizing many of these articles when posting to /r/science.
1	6	The universe is a big place, we'd be fine as immortals. 
-	-	We'll have advanced nanotech by the time global warming is even a blip on the radar. It's a non-issue, it always has been, technology will catch up (like it did with agriculture in the 1970's that everyone was so worried about)

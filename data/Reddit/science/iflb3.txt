-	-	That was just one example. This stuff was posted to /r/science as well.
-	-	This will eventually happen, but right now we need to focus on increasing the energy density of materials we use, while investing in better forms of energy(I.E. Fusion)
0	5	Here I am thinking there was some new development in this because I read about it a few weeks ago. I am disappointed :(
-	-	Search for MIT Battery and you'll see this reposted about 6 different times. Here is one of them. http://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/htqli/researchers_at_mit_have_developed_a_new_battery/
-	-	&gt;The technology developed in the lab has been licensed to 24M, a company spun out of MIT and funded with about $16 million in venture capital and federal research funding.   This is what always bugs me about these sorts of things. There's way too many places that say "donate to find this cure" or "research money to our school" that as soon as something valuable is about to come out of it, research stops and a new for-profit company is spun up to actually commercialize it.
-	-	But when can it make my cellphone work for a week without a charge?  Or my laptop?  Once this happens without having several score extra batteries on standby, we can start seeing seriously revolutionary technology.  Like the wearable computers in RAINBOWS END by Vernor Vinge, or DAEMON and FREEDOM (tm) by Daniel Suarez.  Those things will really exist one day, but not with a battery that craps out after watching a movie.  
1	6	Hmmm, sounds like a reversible, closed fuel cell system?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_battery
-	-	What do I use today that is the product of a MIT breakthrough? 
0	1	This is the shit you see coming out of a Gekko's leg when Raiden slices it.
-	-	There's nothing wrong with crossposting. I'm not subscribed to /r/energy.
-	-	If I donated money to research this, and it became commercialized, i would feel that my investment had paid off handsomely, in clean air for my grandchildren.  Universities don't mass produce batteries, and venture capitalists won't invest millions unless there is a potential for big payouts.  Half of the world tried having communally owned, state managed industry, that plan failed.  I just want GE to pay income tax on it when they start selling them. 
0	5	Sorry, I searched for "MIT battery mold" and didn't find anything.   EDIT: Oops, should have seen http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/flow-batteries-0606.html
-	-	If you search for comments such as yours you will find their have been thousands of such postings....

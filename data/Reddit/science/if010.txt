-	-	Gah... I hate articles that try to describe how loud something is. 99.2 decibels what? A? SPL? (admittedly, at 10kHz they're about the same)  And at what distance? 1 mm from the animal? 1 meter? It never mentions how loud it actually is for the people walking along the bank of the river, which is when you'd actually hear it. The orchestra example is useless without knowing how the number was generated.

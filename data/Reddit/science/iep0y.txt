1	6	Well thats cool. Any way to make it not mold nor dry out?
-	-	Any food will do that in the right conditions.  We tried to make bread moldy for a class project in grade 5, after 2 months the bread was dried out but did not mold at all.    
1	6	Got any interesting explanations on that honey one? I thought it would at least deteriorate away after all the sugar was burned from the air or something like that.
-	-	Well the if I am not mistaken the bread started to dry out a bit, and i'm not saying it was crusty hard break someones jaw hard.  There are jars of honey that is perfectly good that has been found in tombs in eygpt that are 2000 years old.  So i'm just saying it does not mean its filled with chemicals.
-	-	If the conditions are right for us to form, they're right for bacterium to form too.
-	-	It was in a sealed container in a sealed tomb unground.  But yeah Food isn't as easy to rot as we all think, the conditions are just right for it to happen in most places"if that makes any sense"  
1	6	Oh? Sounds rather interesting.
-	-	But yeah, I don't eat mcdonalds because they put something in it..  to make you forget,  Aside from the crazyness I really do think they put a mild addictive additive into the spices.  I worked there and a burger has a big difference in taste and hunger"afterwards" with and without the spices.   And I have seen many rot in the parking lot and from cleaning out behind a bolted down metal container in the hot humid kitchen.

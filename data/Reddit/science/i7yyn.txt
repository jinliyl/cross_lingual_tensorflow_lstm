0	2	This article was so fucking awful I didn't read it. 
0	1	This guy (Razib Khan) writes about interesting stuff, but his writing annoys the heck out of me. It reminds me of a sophomore asked to research a subject, who then googles the shit out of it and reads through 50 papers and then tries to describe all of them to prove that he's really read all 50.  The problem with this approach is that reading 50 papers doesn't make you an expert, you're just a slightly more informed amateur, and you often have no way of telling which of those 50 is more meaningful or relevant to the thesis you are making. As a result, you make no thesis, and in a poor imitation of an "expert" you try to weight everything equally in the belief that knowledge is all about balance and detail. You go out of your way to mention little snippets of information, because you're afraid someone will call you out on something and you want to show in advance that you're not ignorant, you've read about that point too. Look, I knew about that all along! I even mentioned it in paragraph 37, line 12!  This is why reading something written by an expert is so much more enjoyable and meaningful than reading stuff written by someone who just swallowed a google and wants to regurgitate it before his publishing deadline. Unfortunately, experts are scarce and hard to find and don't always blog. They tend to save their effort for peer reviewed stuff and books. Ah well.
0	1	Are there people who enjoy his writing style?  I thought you were being harsh or condescending so I made a real effort to slog though the link.  I knew someone who was like this once.
0	2	So... To sum up: No one knows whats going on with cultural anthropology.

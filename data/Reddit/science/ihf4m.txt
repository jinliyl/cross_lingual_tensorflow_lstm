-	-	mmmmmm death by chocolate, almost as great as death by snu snu... almost.
0	1	The headline of the article is a little misleading, it's the extra fat rather than the chocolate that kills cells.
1	4	I'm so glad it's not about the toxicity of chocolate   would eating 1 entire container of Ben &amp; Jerry's cause cell death?
-	-	Unless I missed it, the type of excess fat that triggered cell death wasn't specified. I have what some (but not many) might consider a high fat diet, but that fat comes from olive oil almost exclusively. The fat in olive oil is generally considered to be beneficial. So, what sort of conclusion is a lay person such as myself supposed to draw from this other than don't eat fatty junk food? Are even beneficial fats to be avoided? Again, lay person here.
0	2	cocoa butter is fat, although it's unlikely the chocolate most people eat has much of it. Mostly trans-fat fillers, and that stuff is poison. 
-	-	kills cells = shed weight
1	7	&gt; I can't cite any papers off the top of my head, but I can imagine a scenario where eating a moderate amount of 'junk fat' would be better for one's health than an excess of 'healthy' fat.  This is kind of what I was trying to get at. I understood the premise of the article, but since type of fat wasn't specified I wasn't sure if it applied to all fats. Thanks for the clarification.
-	-	This article was really about the discovery that a group of small nucleolar RNA's are able mediate apoptosis in non-adipocyte cells.  To answer your question in the context of this article: excess fat in the blood stream is taken up by adipocytes-but their storage capacity is finite. At a certain point excess fat is taken up by cells that aren't meant to function as fat storing cells resulting in lipotoxicity and cell death.  I can't cite any papers off the top of my head, but I can imagine a scenario where eating a moderate amount of 'junk fat' would be better for one's health than an excess of 'healthy' fat. So fat in moderation.  Also I think a lot of evidence is leading to the idea that the human body is currently designed to handle periods without food intake. But in the modern world the normal signals that mediate these processes are interrupted because many people basically eat all day leading to inflammation, diabetes, cancer, etc.

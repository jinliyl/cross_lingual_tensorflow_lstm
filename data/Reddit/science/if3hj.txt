-	-	Then He might want to replace whoever in charge of the weather, cause it take so many strikes just to get one man.
-	-	I always keep 2 mountains open and dare mother nature to Chain Lightning.
-	-	Because women are less retarded and stay inside when its storming.  Us men are tards and chase them.
0	2	Bitches be crazy, *statistically*.  Wow, it works! 
-	-	we are out looking to make sure women aren't out in the rain, lol
0	2	I was going to say that men do far more stupid things that involve lightning that women... But what you said works rather well too.
-	-	Or: Lightning strikes far more on outdoor jobs.
-	-	Taller statistically? I thought they were taller vertically...
0	1	And fucking people's fathers in the rain
0	1	The trailer park where my mom lives pretty much flooded last spring.  It was 3 feet deep rushing water all on the front area of the park (only way in/out too) and god fucking damnit, I was out of cigs and booze.  Busted out some garbage bags, rigged up ghetto waders, and plowed through it and 1/4 mile down the road to the liquor store.  Fuck nature when I'm out of cigs and booze.
-	-	Or: Lightening strikes far more often on golf courses than in kitchens.
-	-	Actually it's because men are more often outside doing something when a storm rolls through than women.
-	-	Men have a built-in lightning rod.
1	6	Maybe because men are taller than women, statistically!
-	-	Women have a higher impedance, due to body fat? I'd like to see a body mass/ fat percentage statistics for lightning strikes.
-	-	This is proof that God exists and loves men more.  God wants all these great men at his side.  Also, freeing all these men from their horrible, undeserving wives.
-	-	That's because men are better grounded.
1	6	New study: Lightning less likely to strike a redditor regardless of gender. Caveat: Unless playing World of Warcraft or Magic the Gathering.
-	-	I give you: "Misogyny is Okay When It's Funny, A Case Study"
-	-	Lightning can't reach the kitchen 
-	-	Because men have their own lightning rod...
-	-	Men hav'nt got the good since to come in out of the rain. 
0	2	Zeus was always a ladies man.
-	-	Men are also far more likely to accidentally set themselves on fire and then fall off a roof impaling their chest on a clutched beer can. Statisticians are baffled.
-	-	I know a guy who's been struck by lightning twice. He's just a tall construction worker. Guy is like a tree compared to most people.
-	-	Probably because men are outside more, statically.  notice how ending my sentence with the word *statistically* makes it not sound misogynistic.  
-	-	~~Probably because women should be in the kitchen.~~
-	-	the earth's electric charges are attracted to my lightning rod of steel
-	-	correlation doesnt always entail causality.
1	7	Golf !
-	-	Or: guys go fishing more often.

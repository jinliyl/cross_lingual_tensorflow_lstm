1	4	Precisely. Which environmental factors are we talking about?  So far, few of the titles on the subject mention the most crucial detail about what they mean by environment. It's stuff like that which gives the anti-vaccination types a crack to gain a foothold.  Personally, as someone who buys into evolutionary psychology, I think its about time we took the in-utero approach to a lot of why our traits vary so widely.

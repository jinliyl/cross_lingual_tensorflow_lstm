0	1	&gt;&gt;One promising idea, known as magnetic hyperthermia, involves injecting minuscule "nanoparticles," basically microscopic lumps of iron oxide or other compounds, into tumors to make them magnetic. The patient is put into a magnetic field that reverses direction thousands of times every second. The magnetic nanoparticles are excited by the applied field and begin to get hot, heating and potentially destroying the surrounding cancer tissue. Because healthy tissue is not altered by the magnetic field, it does not heat up and is not damaged.   Dunecat  approves.  Please proceed to humans.  Tired of losing family to this shit.  
-	-	Uh, they've been doing this for years. They just didn't call them nano particles.
0	2	The problem has never been killing large tumor masses, especially those which can be reached via external injection.  Shit, if you can inject the tumor full of iron oxide, why not skip the middle man and inject them with chemo drugs?  The real issue is and has always been specific binding, followed by early detection.  From a protein-binding standpoint, cancer cells look very normal to your immune system.  They (typically) don't have a red flag that says "hey iron particles, over here, bind to me, I'm cancer."  Then early detection is still a problem too.  Most of the poor-prognosis cancers present as non-palpable, diffuse, hard-to-reach bastards which won't show up outside of a contrast CATscan read by a really smart oncologist.    I'm not saying this isn't useful, just that it isn't the breakthrough needed to save your family.  What is needed is the method to specifically bind drugs/nanoparticles/poison to cancer cells.
0	2	I call shenanigans.  Next thing we know, Magneto will show up and fling all of the cancer patients into the ocean.
0	1	Chemo drugs have nasty nasty side effects, these do not.
0	2	This technology isn't anything new, something I'm actually working on at the moment. The reason they use this method is because it actually makes chemotherapy more effective when used in conjunction with magnetic hyperthermia.  You don't have to bind the particles to the cancer cells, they only need to be in the general region, which you can do with some sort of targeting, or in most cases, none is needed at all.
-	-	Sooon, sooooon.
-	-	Chemo drugs have nasty effects because they are given systemically.  I was referring to a localized injection.  This isn't as common because the preferred treatment is usually to excise the mass if the cancer is reachable, non-metastatic, and non-vital to function.  You are speaking as though chemo and this nanoparticle technique are competing treatments.  They are not until the specific binding matter is resolved.  Plus, if anyone figures out how to specifically bind to cancer cells, there will be much cheaper and easier drug payloads to kill the cells than this nano stuff.  Right now this is just a proof-of-concept technique that lacks a key step in the pipeline.
0	1	It's been "soon" for 50 years.
0	1	Are you reading what I am typing?  What is coming soon?  Until you can bind to cancer, this nano stuff is not clinically useful.  But, if you can bind to cancer, there's a hundred easier drugs which you could attach to the binding molecule and use selectively treat the cancer.  This is like claiming you have the cure for world hunger and all you need to make it work is a helicopter to fly the food to every starving person on Earth.  The problem isn't the food; it's getting it where it needs to go.

-	-	For those wondering how they diagnosed the disorder:  &gt;  The [Young Diagnostic Questionnaire for Internet addiction] criteria consisted of the following eight “yes” or “no” questions which were:  &gt; 1. Do you feel absorbed in the Internet (remember previous online activity or the desired next online session)? 2.  Do you feel satisfied with Internet use if you increase your amount of online time?  3. Have you failed to control, reduce, or quit Internet use repeatedly? 4. Do you feel nervous, temperamental, depressed, or sensitive when trying to reduce or quit Internet use?  5. Do you stay online longer than originally intended?  6. Have you taken the risk of losing a significant relationship, job, educational or career opportunity because of the Internet? 7. Have you lied to your family members, therapist, or others to hide the truth of your involvement with the Internet?  8. Do you use the Internet as a way of escaping from problems or of relieving an anxious mood (e.g., feelings of helplessness, guilty, anxiety, or depression)?   &gt; All of the eight questions were translated into Chinese. Young asserted that five or more “yes” responses to the eight questions indicated an internet-dependent user.   &gt; Later on, Beard and Wolf modified the YDQ criteria, and respondents who answered “yes” to questions 1 through 5 and at least to any one of the remaining three questions were classified as suffering from internet addiction, which was used for screening the subjects in the present study

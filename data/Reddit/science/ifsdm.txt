-	-	TBH I had to read that a couple of times myself with a furrowed brow. On Sunday no less.  :)
-	-	This may still be the case over a longer period of time. 
-	-	Also bear in mind that this is really about *automatic* hijacking of attention by an attractive face. . .by other measures, you may still pay plenty of attention to attractive faces, even when someone is paying attention to you.
-	-	Then please do so.
-	-	Do or do not.  There is no try.
1	6	or is it more like, you cease to be interested in any hot girls even the one that likes you?
1	6	Well, it's not exactly surprising that there are multiple evolutionary strategies right?
1	6	the study says that an attractive person will stop seeming attractive, if they show interest in you. I think this is regardless to your romantic situation.
1	6	If I'm in a relationship, and someone more attractive hits on me, knowing I'm in a relationship, I'll tear her throat out.  *shrugs.*  I was surprised to learn it could be any other way. 
-	-	Not sure if trolling...
0	5	Something worth more than this squiggly line $
0	1	Save the 30 bucks, what I said is the correct answer.
1	4	So in other words: "Any port in a storm, amiright?"  Great work, science, didn't know that already.
-	-	The article has nothing to do with the question being asked in the title of this post. The article isn't trying to answer that question. It's asking if the brain stops paying as much attention to other potential mates once a given potential mate shows interest. Fail title.    
-	-	More news from the Patently Obvious Gazette
0	2	Since the article is behind a pay wall, there is no way to determine whether or not the abstract is full of shit or not.
0	1	Awww, now love is scientifically blind.  (at least until you get laid)
-	-	**tl;dr:** If you are interested in 10 hot chicks, then 1 of them starts showing that she is interested in you, you start ignoring the other 9 hot chicks and focus on the 1 hot chick that is interested in you.
0	5	Alcohol / desperation.  
1	8	Too bad that most people don't consider someone attractive based solely on their face.  Also, hot isn't the same thing as attractive.  
1	4	Ah, so that's what they meant by the second sentence in the Abstract. Makes more sense than what I'd said, hahaha. Thanks for the clarification!
1	4	If we tie this to the theory that girls seem to be attracted to guys who are already taken, we should be able to attract the girls by ignoring them. LOGIC!!!
0	2	No, screwing fat chicks can be fun.
0	5	These both seem like strong possibilities but I can't decide which one is more likely because the title is botched and I don't have $30 to read it myself!
-	-	So I read this and thought "Man, I really need to read more books because my reading comprehension must be at an all time low."   I feel better knowing about myself now that I'm not the only one struggling just to get through the title.
-	-	In other news, study establishes inverse correlation between how hungry you are and how recently you ate
-	-	The abstract makes it sound like they were *trying* to find data that supports their hypothesis. I don't like science that sounds like that. Can anyone that actually read the full study give opinions on the quality of this? I'm not paying $31.50.
1	8	Yes, you're correct. time for redemptional karma-kiri.
-	-	Google the title of the article in quotes. It works for a lot of articles, but it takes some digging. Appending ".pdf" in the search criteria winnows that even further.  I'm in college and this is the way I normally do it. It doesn't work for new (&lt;1 year) articles, but that's still a lot.
-	-	Maybe because the string "hot girls" is present in the title?
-	-	Probably for the article content?
-	-	I think what they meant was that there's a thing they call "automatic attention to attractive opposite-sex", whereas you automatically pay attention to someone's face if you find them attractive. This thing shuts down if the person with the attractive face shows reciprocation towards your feelings of being attracted.  That is to say, if you're hot but you're too forward/loving initially, the people who think you're hot won't think you're so hot. At least, that's how I understand it.
0	1	Even better:  Fucking retardation.
1	4	Right. Your version of the title also would have garnered more upvotes.
0	2	For a short period of time. Then come the hookers.
-	-	Works every time
0	1	I have a deep believe that anything can be described simply, you just proved it.  I think universities almost only use big words because they want to sound smarter then the average person, which I think, is bullshit. 
-	-	To Brasky!!!
-	-	*If science isn't presented in a understandable way*  Quantum Mechanics.
1	8	?? How was the title hard to understand? — Granted, it uses some psychology jargon, but it's not particularly difficult to decipher.  tl;dr: Could've been worded better, but I've seen much worse.   (also, it seems it was translated from German.)
0	1	If it sounds weird, it may be that you are not familiar with the terminology of that field.
0	1	I agree. I read that abstract and thought to myself, I have no god damn idea what they are trying to convey.
0	2	NO MORE AMBIGUOUS QUESTIONS!!!!!!
1	8	My husband works in a highly technical field. He honestly believes if you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it yourself.  I also think if you can't talk about something without using aphorisms, or cultural slang you have a lazy mind. 
-	-	The original title is a bit better:  "When the grass on the other side of the fence doesn't matter: Reciprocal romantic interest neutralizes attentional bias towards attractive alternatives"
-	-	I understand why youre a bit annoyed but It's psychological jargon that psychs can't help but become accustomed to. I found it very intuitive to understand. Not big noting myself. Just wanted to help clear this up. They write for their main audience.. Other psych researchers. And in some areas of research we appreciate titles that don't beat around the bush or try to be too fancy.. Just tell us what you found. 
0	1	It's that damned question that's throwing you off. At least that was the case for me. If I only read the part after the colon and ignored the question, I would have understood the title the first time I looked at it. With the question, you think "yeah, this is about how people need to lower their standards" and then the rest makes no sense. I think what the OP was trying to get us to think with that question was "yeah, you can't be checking out all the other hot babes/hunks when you've got one right in front of you who's interested."
0	5	My apologies. I was probably trying too hard to use semi-technical to be accurate.
-	-	Yeah, that's a result of the nih requiring studies that they have funded be available online.   Outside of medicine though, there is no requirement that journal articles be posted online. Try looking for information on just about any topic on [google scholar](http://scholar.google.com/) and at least half the articles will require ~$30 to read.
-	-	&gt;Do you know what their justification is for taking copyright instead of publication rights?  Money.  They want it. 
0	1	There's no justification at all. I think most authors are so excited to get into a journal that they just sign away their rights.
0	1	It doesn't mean a goddamn thing at all. Why is this even being upvoted if even the title is gibberish.
-	-	I didn't find it incoherent.
-	-	&gt;theoretical physicists  More than that.  Astrophysicists also use ADS in a similar way.
-	-	I think SSRN provides a similar function for academics in the social sciences.
-	-	Shurly shome mishtake  [$31.50=£19.60](http://www.google.com/search?q=31.5usd+in+gbp)...
1	8	What's that squiggly you got there next to yer 63?
-	-	There have been many studies about that, and this is why theoretical physicists, computer scientists and mathematicians use [http://arxiv.org/](http://arxiv.org/) to post their articles before sending them off to the journals.  In theoretical physics, I've been told, some established people don't even bother posting to the journals (one reason for that is that the citation counter that they use - think submission karma for scientists -  includes arXiv submussions).
-	-	I've done such a study but to see the results you must buy the pdf for £63.
-	-	Fat chick success... Wait, the study didn't actually say unattractive people keep your attention.
1	4	That is a fascinating anecdote, thanks for sharing.
-	-	[/r/scholar](http://www.reddit.com/r/scholar)
-	-	I wouldn't call academia a cartel; it's just that before the Internet, journals were an established, working means of peer review and knowledge dissemination.   The recent challenge is due to the Internet, in my opinion, and the model is already changing. As with any change, it will take time, but it will get there. 
-	-	haaa. touche. 
0	5	&gt; When you submit an article to the journal, you give up the copyright.  Wow, my respect for scientific journals as a whole just took a nosedive. Do you know what their justification is for taking copyright instead of publication rights? My google-fu has failed to find anything useful on the subject.
0	1	I don't even understand the title. Why should I even bother opening the link?  If science isn't presented in a understandable way, then it's being done incorrectly.  PS: I am not dumb. I am studying mechanical engineering and know that not everything can be explained in simple words. But come on!  EDIT: I *did* actually read it. Saying "why should I even bother opening the link?" was meant as a rhetorical question!
-	-	Most poorly written headline in my history of using reddit. Not to mention, it's basically an advertisement for a $31.50 piece of intangible paper.
0	2	am i getting this right? (you spend your days looking at hot girls on facebook, but when one of these hot girls shows interest in you. you then stop browing hotties on facebook and simply hang out with the girl that likes you?)
-	-	Oh I see, so if you show interest in someone interested in you then they stop automatically checking out other competition. Interesting.
-	-	"Even if you ate, you might still be hungry." I dunno, to me it seems pretty apparent. Maybe I'm in the minority though, in which case sorry for hijacking your post.
-	-	I realize that, but I thought this subreddit was for the findings that aren't just confirming well-established suspicions
-	-	From personal experience, that's what I would have expected. An attractive person is always attractive to me, regardless of my romantic situation. I guess that makes me an anomaly.
1	4	Gotta love that hindsight bias.
1	4	Right, that's the complete opposite haha. 
-	-	That or "you become better at concealing that you are looking at alternatives". A wise strategy if you wish to keep what you have.
-	-	Ahh ich verstehe!
-	-	&gt; Is there a German version of that abstract around somewhere? I'd really like to learn German so I can understand it.
0	1	Basically, if she wants to suck your dick, it doesn't matter if she looks like Janet Reno. Where's my Dipl.-Psych.?
0	1	What the fuck does this say? It sounds like if someone is attracted to you and then you act attracted back they are suddenly no longer interested.  This would explain a lot. 
-	-	but if i only look at attractive girls, how can i be reciprocated by a non-attractive?
-	-	Purchase $31.50.  Ha!
0	1	Shitty articles like this getting 437 upvotes is how I know I'm not the biggest fucking idiot on reddit. Thanks guys
-	-	TL;DR:  If someone less attractive likes us, we tend to settle.
-	-	So, if your potential mate has an attractive face, and she reciprocates, she's suddenly less attractive? (I use she, I mean both).  **edit** Okay I think I get it. Let **A** be the set of all attractive people Let **B** be a subset of that set consisting of potential mates Let **C** be another set which has intersections with **A** and **B** with the added property that they have reciprocated  if **A** is in **B** but not **C** and **C** is not empty then **A** and **B** become unattractive.  See? Totally lucid.
-	-	&gt; agreed to participate in our study for a payment of 1,- € (approximately 1.25 $) and a chocolate bar.  Wow. East Germany is still cheap. I'd have demanded at least a Rostbrätl.

1	4	yes, I know that now.
-	-	"Automatic attention to attractive opposite-sex faces is shut down if a potential mate reciprocates your interest."  Huh. You sure you are doing mech ? I mean, its okay to admit if you are a a MBA or arts student. No judgement.
-	-	Wouldn't the result seem just as "obvious" if it had been "Even if someone shows interest in you, you still look at hot girls (or guys)?"

-	-	The bulk of science is confirming well-established suspicions. Until we do this it's all just tales out of school.
0	1	Is there a German version of that abstract around somewhere? I'd really like to read it... Vielleicht verstehe ich dann etwas mehr!
1	7	We found a winner!
1	4	Welcome to Academicspeak.
0	1	Who the hell actually reads the evidence?  We trust the journalist's, amiright?
-	-	*touches nose and points at you*
-	-	I would totally let myself go, jk.
-	-	They want $31.50 for a PDF of their superfluous study?
-	-	Reading the abstract makes the answer obvious.
-	-	Alcohol
-	-	I think that result would be more likely. I would assume people always want better on average but I guess that is not the case. 
-	-	And that's why I didn't go into Quantum Mechanics.
1	4	I was just kidding, I read the comments and then the abstract. Thank you for your coherent explanation. :P
0	1	In that wording, yes, onehundred *fucking* percent!
0	1	I can do even better.  If someone you want to fuck indicates that they want to fuck you, you stop noticing other hot people.
-	-	Next research project:  Figure out the half life to this effect, because there definitely is one. 
-	-	Actually the abstract says they only used attractive people for the "reciprocated attention". I'm not positive the sane would apply if the person wasn't attractive.  Ie, a hot person who wants you will keep your attention but I don't know about a less attractive person.
-	-	The lesson here is *never try*.
0	5	For retards maybe, I'm way too smart to understand it.
-	-	Quantum Mechanics can be presented very understandable. It might not be intuitive though.
-	-	Simple, concise, plain: pick two.
-	-	Im a guy who likes girls  What im getting from the title is if any girl showes interest in me i turn off my automatic "give the hot girl all my attention" mechanism  
-	-	Why are people upvoting an abstract? Considering this is /r/science, I'd expect people to reserve judgment until seeing the evidence from the study, rather than evidence of evidence.
-	-	So you want what you don't yet have. Is that the point? Honest question, I'm not sure if I understood the abstract.
-	-	if all girls would just be hot, then we'd all get hot girls! derrr!
-	-	Are you John Nash?
-	-	This entire abstract is confusing, does anyone have a copy of the PDF?
1	4	I like this abstract. It demonstrates good creative use of scientific hypothesis formation and testing. And shows how doing so can open up a new phenomenon in a way that allows it to be better understood at the neural level. Anyone can observe a behavioural trend, but rarely is it easy to link behaviour to underlying patterns of processing. Social neuroscientists and evolutionary psychs will have a field day reading this. 
-	-	I understand the title correctly? So looks don't matter if you have interests in common?
-	-	I pictured the forever alone scientist that slowly developed this hypothesis through a steady stream of tears.
-	-	That's why we have alcohol to lower our inhibitions and to copulate with inferior beings.  
-	-	Relax, almost all articles are free after 6months-1year for the general public. Any scientist who needs to see the paper can anyway, since their University will have access.  Edit: and the Reddit mass with pitchforks set in. Please read my comments to below to understand, then downvote away.
0	1	I'll alert the press.
-	-	[deleted]
-	-	I think it's about mate selection where if a potential partner you find attractive responds in kind then it inhibits the attractiveness of any alternative mates.  Basically when you find a suitable partner, presumably to produce offspring, you stop wanting to play the field.  Some evolutionary species survival stuff goin' on there.

-	-	It says right in the headline "Reciprocal romantic interest neutralizes attentional bias towards attractive *alternatives*".
-	-	Huh.   Maybe this explains why hot girls start hitting on you the moment you're in a relationship.   You don't automatically check them out and they notice you're different.
-	-	Booya: [د.ك](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwaiti_dinar)
-	-	It's the former.  "Automatic attentional capture" is reduced.  Once you know a person, it doesn't constitute as *automatic* anymore.    
-	-	Please re-read my statement before the masses get out their pitchforks; I've worked as a scientist publishing studies for a few years and I know what I'm talking about.  Let's take a look at what you're citing:  Effectiveness estimates for center high mounted stop lamps: A six-year study  Purchase $ 41.95 Charles M. Farmer Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 1005 North Glebe Road, Arlington, VA 22201, U.S.A.  in the journal: Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention   1) It's not authored by anyone in a University 2) It's not published in any widely-read, important/high-impact journal.  I said "almost" all. If a laboratory is funded by the NIH, which most are, it is expected that they publish in a journal which makes the work available in PubMed. The journal makes money by having exclusive rights to the work for the first 6mo-1year, then the article is generally free to the public. Again, it depends on the journal. 
-	-	Go pub med it. Read below my response to "shodanx" for some insight.  It's meaningless to show you free articles because there are literally tens or hundreds of thousands (millions?). But, here is just one links. Notice how it says Free PMC article?  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=mackinnon%20roderick
0	1	Basically, it's saying that the little alarm that goes off in your head everytime an attractive person crosses your field of vision will stop going off once you start conversing with a member of the desired sex that you think wants to fuck you, too.  Got it?
-	-	I agree that OP's title is pretty awfully worded (no offense mycrazynephew), but the actual abstract by the scientists is pretty intelligible.
-	-	If you're at college, which a decent portion of reddit probably is, you can get it for free through your library.
-	-	Not the journal cartel, the academic cartel in general. To get a job, you need publications. To get publications, you need to surrender the copyright. Up until very recently, noone has bothered to question this. I understand that the peer review process costs money but selling individual articles for $30 is just outrageous.
-	-	Someone should do a study on the costs and benefits of charging such prices for access to studies.
-	-	It's the journal cartel that prices access to the articles, the authors have no control over it. When you submit an article to the journal, you give up the copyright.  Most universities would have open access to the journal website, but for that they are paying a hefty fee.  To combat this, [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) was created, and is actively used in several fields (mathematics, computer science, physics). It has not spread to other sciences yet; this might have to do with the fact that only recent "help from Microsoft" made arXiv accept .doc/.ooxml submissions (the most standard and widespread format is .tex, i.e. LaTeX, which is auto-compiled to PDF).
-	-	Read them anyway
1	6	Would if I mate while thinking of other hot people.  Does that make me more evolved because I can do both?
0	1	I'm not sure but I was in the supermarket the other day and it was full of ugly fat fucks.  Every aisle was just an array of pasty fat fucks with coupons.
-	-	what about those who aren't in college ? 
-	-	Okay, basically what its saying is this: Normally we devote our attention and interest to attractive faces, BUT when some one is interested in us, it negates that bias toward attractive faces, and thus mating shall occur.
-	-	I read the title/abstract then was about to complain I didn't understand.  Then I realized it was translated from German, and how hard it is to do that, and it made it all better.
1	4	The title isn't very clear, but I think they mean that you're less automatically attentive to attractive faces if you have a mate (/someone that shares a mutual interest with you).   Totally true, when I was happy with my ex-boyfriend I didn't notice how attractive his friend/model was. After we split I definitely realized haha.
1	6	Well, I'm in CS and we praise change every day in our research proposals and marketing material. I think it sad that we don't do the same in the candidate selection criteria. I am only asked about my pet projects once every 10 interviews (and they are interesting).
-	-	filetype:pdf 
0	1	My concern is actually as much for the authors as the general public. Expecting someone to relinquish copyright (any claim of ownership of their work, basically) after a paper or article has been written is generally considered by the majority of the publishing industry as a shitty thing to do.
0	2	&gt;Relax, almost all articles are free after 6months-1year for the general public  Are they bollocks.
-	-	Where are these articles posted after 6-12 months?
-	-	this study is still 41$ http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0001457595000542
-	-	&gt; I think most authors are so excited to get into a journal that they just sign away their rights.  You must have no idea how academia works to say it that way.  In most parts, no publication = no job. You are expected to publish regularly to get a job, and then to keep it, and if you lose your job, it's hard, if not impossible, to get back. Publications are a matter of livelihood for a lot of people; there are plenty of things to worry about, and copyright concerns are waaay back on the list.  That, and the fact that most campus where the field is of relevance have subscriptions to the articles anyway, meaning that all who need to have access to the article will have it.  Given that, fighting for open access is an uphill battle. At that, in some areas posting articles on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org) and/or personal website is the norm today. Mathematics, physics, computer science are examples of fields where you are expected to post on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org); some people go as far as to post *only* there, bypassing journals altogether.
-	-	Also don't forget that we have to pay to publish in the journal as well, even open access journals have page and image charges.
0	2	I know i wouldn't be here reading comments otherwise, even if the title was still non-sense.
0	2	No, that's even worse.
-	-	What?
-	-	Wow, I thought the title was rather clear. Then I read this thread and re:read the title and realised it was quite the opposite of what I originally thought. Then I read even more and changed my opinion yet again. I'm settling on your theory as it's happened to me. I always put it down to 'the fun is in the chase'.
1	7	Thank you.
1	4	We do tend to be more fun in bed, sometimes. 
0	1	If you want to fuck somebody who wants to fuck you, you don't pay as much attention to other pretty people as you did before you found someone who wanted to fuck you.
0	1	Downvotes suck. $31 is fucking outrageous. 
-	-	Not quite.  The point is that people tend to gear their attention towards attractive people.  However, if someone shows romantic interest in you, then this tendency (attention towards attractive people) is diminished.  
-	-	I think it's more like "once you find it, you stop looking as hard at alternatives."
1	8	When you're single, you _automatically_ check out anything hot that crosses your path.    When you have the potential to get into a relationship, this stops being reflexive.      Presumably to drive focus onto the potential mate and ensure the continuation of the species.
-	-	You're not getting it, look at this sentence: Therefore, we hypothesized that an orienting of attention to attractive opposite-sex faces is inhibited as soon as a potential mating partner reciprocates one's romantic feelings.  If A is interested in attractive partners, and sees B, and B likes A, then A is less interested in other Attractive Partners.    If you were building a Romantic Robot wouldn't you build in these type of rules?  Makes sense to me.  A should develop a special relationship with B, by being less distracted from alternatives C, D, and E.   
-	-	It's because the OP didn't make a clear distinction between "potential mates" and "attractive faces". For one, mates and faces are different categories of objects, and for another attractive mates are also potential mates (they may just have *less* potential). Overall it's a fairly incoherent headline.
0	1	It isn't your fault. That title is horribly incoherent.

-	-	This is not a very scientifically revealing discovery.  Scientists have known that advanced visual systems have existed even before 515 million years ago, which is the age of this fossil. While this is pretty neat, it doesn't really bring any new scientific value to paleontology.  For example, it is widely known that trilobites had compound eyes that were as advanced as this specimen even from their first appearance in the fossil record in the early Cambrian. This potentially indicates that complex visual systems like these had origins much before the Cambrian explosion. Also, some trilobite eyes have been preserved in as much detail as this one, with as many as 15,000 lenses! This fossil is not very unique.  Essentially, this fossil is interesting, but paleontologists already have well-preserved fossilized eyes that date to this same age if not older(e.g. trilobite eyes).   Source: I did a lecture on trilobites a couple weeks ago, and one of the things I talked about was their eyes.

-	-	if you think about it as an evolutionary advantage this would make sense. any small improvement in vision would be a distinct adavatage over any predecessor and would  at least comparatively to other evolutionary processes  make it appear fast on an evolutionary scale. or my 2 cents on the matter

-	-	Once you have the trick of multicellularity, it would seem easy to have *x*-many compound eyes.  But resolving that those inputs in a single image could take longer to evolve. Just having something that would detect change in light would be a survival advantage (e.g. it's not helpful when you've moving).  It's interesting to think of image recognition in terms of usage, for survival advantage (not of perfecting an image) - just detecting a particular *colour* might be useful.

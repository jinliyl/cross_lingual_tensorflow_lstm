0	1	I think we can all agree that the mainstream media doesn't give one fuck about what scientists have or have not  "generally discarded."
-	-	&gt;and his controversial, now generally discarded, theory that a "death star" was responsible for major mass extinctions  Discarded, really? Where we can find some info about it? Such theories appear in mainstream press regularly every two years...  http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/5046  http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/gammaray_extinction.html  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3900550/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/theory-links-ancient-extinction-supernova/
-	-	The problem is, such opinion determines the prevailing opinion of redditors about it here.

0	5	Its sad that this, the most dumbass comment in the thread, has the most upvotes, while the intelligent stuff is all downvoted. 
-	-	Physics at this scale is far too non-intuitive to say what makes more or less "sense".
-	-	The problem is that *we* aren't expanding. If that were the case, it would mean that *objects* are moving away from us faster than the speed of light, and this would really upset Einstein. But this isn't the case; *space* is expanding away from us faster than the speed of light. 
-	-	&gt; expanding into an already existing nothing  Except that the extra nothing is apparently showing up in the middle of what's already here.  Hard to "expand into existing nothing" when your nothing is showing up between you and what you're looking at.
-	-	In many theories the dark energy density wasn't constant.  http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-04-antigravity-dark-energy-universe-expansion.html  http://www.physorg.com/news205133042.html  http://www.physorg.com/news161026176.html  Apparently, cosmology is quite adjustable science in the question of Universe expansion.
-	-	"Dark energy" and "dark matter" from what I understand are just the name we gave to parts of the universe we don't know shit about.  And I guess for now as long as we have not good theory explaining these observations we can only attach these properties to names like "dark energy" to have an easy way of referencing them as we search for an actual explanation.  It might not be even energy for all we know, it's just a temporary name we gave to some properties of the universe we didn't understand but vaguely behaved like "matter" and "energy".
1	8	Well, there is a emptiness in the theory that is filled by something. All we can do until the whole world of physics is shattered is think about what could fill in the gaps.
	Its my understanding that  dark energy is merely a hypothesis for something we don't understand, and that we're only at the beginning of having the tools and ideas to begin to better understand it. 
1	4	That's one of the outstanding theories. The problem is that the theoretical value for vacuum pressure is 10^120 times the observed value for dark energy, so we have a huge way to go before we can reasonably call it an explanation.
0	1	Careful now. Before long you'll be calling it god.
-	-	&gt; As the universe expands, it seems that more dark energy appears out of nowhere to sustain the constant dark energy density of the universe.  That sounds like the hallmark of something that doesn't exist and we only think it does because we got our theory wrong.  &lt;runs away before the physicists come in to thrash me&gt;
1	8	**"One of a number of seemingly implausible features of dark energy is that its density is assumed to be constant over time. So, even though the universe expands over time, dark energy does not become diluted, unlike the rest of the contents of the universe. "**  That is, until we learn how wrong we are about dark energy.
1	4	Erm... I guess this is accurate kinda? A better way to view it is that dark energy is just an inherent property of space, so saying that it doesn't become diluted isn't really meaningful. When you frame it that way it's really quite plausible.
1	4	Thanks for the clarification.
0	2	"Dark matter" is a terrible name for it. All that has been observed is pure gravity without any associated matter. But because they called it "dark matter" everyone assumes it must be matter or some sort. And it may be, but all that has been observed is pure gravity. 
0	1	Well then, how am I supposed to finish my science fiction novel now!?  But seriously:  Isn't there a chance that we really have no grasp of either concept, and, in the end, they might turn out to be one in the same (and not at all like what we considered each to be on their own?)   From what I understand, some theories involve 11 or more dimensions; and we're attempting to explain those theories with quite limited brain power?  Unification seems to be such a common goal of physics. But they're talking about unifications in "our" world (i.e., 3 dimensions); whereas "true" unifications could involve a multiverse with infinite dimensions.  Edit: Also, seriously: "Zero"? You're clearly not a scientist. (I could have wikipedia'd your response, which I did, but I didn't find it at all informative.) 
-	-	Ehh, kinda. Newtonian force isn't a useful concept, but "fundamental force" is an understood synonym for "fundamental interaction".
-	-	In AWT such insight has some meaning, because the speed of dispersion of  ripples at the water surface increases with distance exponentially too.   http://www.josesandoval.com/images/waterRipples.jpg  It fits with observed absence of Higgs boson, too (the speed of dispersion in vacuum responsible for particle mass is independent to dimensional scale, so that Higgs boson has no fixed mass).
1	7	There's a very good chance of that!
-	-	"Phantom energy" actually refers to a specific class of dark energy theories, in which the equation of state parameter is less than -1, meaning the energy density actually *increases* as the universe expands (as opposed to the cosmological constant, which has an eos parameter -1 and constant density).
0	2	and mathematicians like priests, but without teh pedophile and just a little of teh gay.
-	-	Im going to make a list of things i don't know, assign them as belonging to the realm of magic and stop bothering trying to figure them out.
-	-	[fairy](http://gaytroll.ytmnd.com/)
0	1	The problem isn't that the lack of a mathematical explanation is giving people false impressions. (If it were, you would not be able to understand the relevant math with just high school calculus no matter how heavily it was annotated, but that's another issue). I'll illustrate the problem here by saying basically what it sounds like you're saying:  "With regular integrals and numbers, the integral from 0 to 4 of x is 8, so it seems reasonable to think that, if the integral from 0 to 1 of 3x^2 were a form of integral and pi a form of number, they could also have a relationship. Also, it seems as if, just going by text-based explanations, both could be related, without being the same thing, through being manifestations of something popping in from another derivative/limit/graph.whatever. Basically, both thumbtacks and wads of gum poking from the carpet backing of calculus into the carpet."  See the problem? It's not that you're just lacking the mathematical details; you're just throwing together random ideas, some of which don't even make sense. If someone went to you with the above paragraph, would you be able to just respond with an explanation of how integrals work? 
-	-	If we could explain dark energy by just saying "oh well there's some mass hanging around", it would be unreasonable to postulate a new field for dark energy too.
0	2	What comments are these specifically? The only ones I see with negative karma are bad ones and Chipney's. And Chipney is getting downvoted because he advocates retarded things in general (although he admittedly has a point here).
1	8	I understand that you're the person here who understands the math. I think the problem here stems from the terminology. With regular matter and energy, e=mc^^2, so it seems reasonable to think that, if farm matter were a form of matter and dark energy a form of energy, they could also have a relationship. Also, it seems as if, just going by text-based explanations, both could be related, without being the same thing, through being manifestations of something popping in from another dimension/universe/layer/whatever. Basically, both thumbtacks and wads of gum poking from the carpet backing of the universe into the carpet.   I think what would help is if somebody took the mathematical explanations and annotated them heavily enough that someone who'd gone up to, say, calculus BC in math could sort of understand the equation-based explanation without having to actually take five mote years of math just to know what the notations in the equations mean.  Even if we still didn't understand the math very well, maybe just seeing how the ideas were formulated mathematically would help bridge the gap between your understanding of this and ours.  
-	-	First off, no, f=ma is not a universal law, it doesn't make sense in relativistic contexts.  Second, galactic clusters *aren't accelerating*. Metric expansion does not move things through space. 
-	-	you should check his comment history. he has like a blackbelt in science or something.   even the guys at AskScience with the colorfull specialty tags are corrected by him.
1	4	im sure he is very smart, but he is mixed up about the expansion of the universe. it is accelerating. this isnt something that can be explained away buy choosing the correct point of view. 
0	2	since i started bitching maybe they got tossed a couple of pity upvotes
-	-	It would have to be bound in some new field, yes.  I don't think it's unreasonable to postulate; after all, dark energy is a new field... maybe. 
-	-	The galaxies are moving away from each other at accelerating rates. If you want to define that has something other than acceleration then you need to invent a whole new physics. 
0	5	So the universe is constantly expanding, and we don't know where the nothing is coming from? Wouldn't it make more sense to think that we're expanding into an already existing nothing rather than postulating that the nothing is expanding along with us with these bizarre properties? 
-	-	I think Dark Energy is gonna be found to be another force. One that we haven't discovered yet but works over great distances. 
-	-	Zero. The Higgs is supposed to give things mass, which is not at all close to what dark energy does.
0	2	Dark matter is pretty uncontestably not a mess. Like, we don't quite know what it *is* yet, but basically everyone agrees that there's just a bunch of matter with no electromagnetic charge flying around galaxies.
-	-	They have already decided calling it "Phantom Energy". (And here I was hoping to suggest "Faire Energy" or "Unicorn Energy"...)
1	4	Magic, got it.
1	6	think of physics like magic, engineers as practitioners, and physicists as wizards and alchemists.
-	-	More like a placeholder for various oddities in measurements vs models, that may have more then one cause once we start to figure it all out.
-	-	Basically yeah. You don't need to sum over the entire universe to find the acceleration of metric expansion, you can just consider a convenient smaller volume.
-	-	Your wording isn't quite right, but it's actually entirely reasonable to assume that dark energy is just an inherent property of space. That's one of the most commonly held explanations, in fact.
-	-	physicists dont really talk about forces anymore. everything is particles. 
1	4	yes but then you have to call gravity magic too. 
1	8	Theres lots of great comments. go check out the -2 ones to learn something. To answer your question: Because in this universe things dont accelerate unless there is a force acting on them. F=MA. 
-	-	If you're going off what we know about the universe... well, we don't have evidence of anything outside the universe we could be expanding into, so it doesn't really make more sense to postulate it.
-	-	Space and matter do influence each other, sure. The point is that space itself is expanding; the galaxies aren't moving *through space*. If you go far enough away, the apparent recession velocity can be faster than light speed, but that's okay because it's an *apparent* velocity rather than actual movement through space.
1	4	Yes, that's the point. The extra space is being *created*, rather than the universe expanding into already existing extra space.
-	-	What Amarkov said, except that also it's not just the things are moving apart. There really is more space in between.  You can tell because we're getting light from things that's younger than it would take to get here.  With a car analogy: Say you have a car that can only go 100 kph. It starts out and after 10 hours it's 2000 kilometers away. There's not just extra space between you and the car. There must be road there that wasn't there when the car started out, or the car would only be at most 1000 kilometers away after 10 hours.  Same thing with space. It's not just "there's more room because things are moving away."  It's that "there's really actually more room between us than there was between those same points a while ago."  Even if the stars were sitting still relative to each other, they'd still be moving apart because more space is coming into existence.
-	-	A better equivalent is the luminiferous aether, through which light was said to travel. I believe dark energy research is valuable, and that it will eventually lead to some interesting results, but for now the whole dark energy thing is little more than a framework standing in place of a real model with real experimentally confirmed results.
-	-	i guess one could say that.
-	-	...no. Something that served as a unification of dark energy and the Higgs field would be so radically different from either that it would make no sense to use those names for it.  But again, they're *fundamentally different concepts*. Asking if there might be a unification of the two is like asking if there might be a unification of electromagnetic charge and velocity.  And on a general note, you seem to be imagining science as a field where oogly boogly is a major component, and it isn't. When people deal with the compactified dimensions in string theory, they don't go "WHOA HOW CAN MY LIMITED HUMAN MIND COMPREHEND THIS", they just go "oh well these equations I have here describe 11 dimensions so okay".
1	4	I think Amarkov's responses are fine, and I understand why physicists who understand the math get frustrated with people who just know the text-based popularization version, but I think the down ratings are a bit much. DrPon isn't saying that perpetual motion machines exist, or that aliens have wiretapped everyone's fillings. This is really just a question about, "Where are the limits between what we really know and what we kind of sort of know?" I think those are reasonable sorts of questions. We may not really know whether stars exist, or whether we exist, on a deep philosophical sense, but it sure feels as if we exist and we can look at stars. We don't know for sure if we've ever interacted with dark matter or dark energy.  I think it's entirely reasonable to be more skeptical about statements about things that are far from everyday experience. 
0	1	That makes very little sense. We've observed gravity, and we know gravity is caused by the presence of matter, so we have therefore observed matter. This is like arguing that we haven't *actually* observed stars, because we've only observed photons which we think are emitted by them.
-	-	[really good talk by Lawrence Krauss that touches on the issue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ImvlS8PLIo) Its an hour long.
0	2	can we just start calling it magic?
-	-	The expansion of the universe is accelerating. That doesn't mean the same thing as saying that any particular mass *in* the universe is accelerating.
-	-	It's an acceleration in the same sense that the recession velocity is a velocity. Yes, it's a second time derivative of position, but the value you get for it varies based on both your position in space and your velocity. How are you going to meaningfully associate a force with an "acceleration" that varies depending on where you stand?
-	-	What force *doesn't* vary depending on where you stand? 
0	2	I think you need to read Popper again; you've created a very bad definition of your notion of "unreasonable". 
-	-	If you can fully explain observed phenomena with things that are known to exist, it is unreasonable to postulate that maybe they're really caused by things which are not known to exist. We can fully explain the sun's light with nuclear fusion, so it would be unreasonable for me to say "well maybe there's not really nuclear fusion and stars just have quintessence which spontaneously generates photons". I don't know what part of Popper's philosophy you think invalidates this?
-	-	all we see is matter accelerating away from other matter. theres no evidence for anything at all other than acceleration of matter. 
-	-	Sounds like Fred Hoyle's old theory about matter pulling other matter into existence.
0	1	Something has to keep pumping that into our universe then.  Zomg interdimensional aliens dumping toxic waste 1!1!oneone!
-	-	why should we expect dark energy to work like normal matter does?
-	-	Dark energy is the "ether" of our times. It doesn't exist. It just fills the holes in our comprehension of the universe. 
-	-	How can you calculate the density of an infinite universe? Do they restrict there calculations to only the known universe?
0	2	would it be stupid to assume that dark energy is space itself?
-	-	What are the chances that dark matter and the Higgs Boson will turn out to be the same "force"?
1	8	Maybe we should just start calling it the dark ether.  On a side note, it does make me wonder when some Einstein-caliber genius will finally come along and shame all of this "dark energy/matter" mess into its grave.
1	8	At the end of the universe, some many billions of years away from us now, people will still exist, although altered. Lacking heat, entropy, substance, these cold ones envy our past. Our substance. Our movement. Thus, using dark and eldritch machines unlike any we can define, they send themselves hurtling backwards through time, to the present day. Now they sit, just out of sight. Watching us.   That is what 'dark energy' is.
-	-	Maybe it's just gravity leaking from another universe?
1	7	"our dark energy, who are in heaven ..."
-	-	So basically its a modern equivalent to [phlogiston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory)?
-	-	Isn't the extra nothing just more space being created through the expansion of the universe? Things are becoming further apart, so naturally wouldn't there be more nothing?
1	4	Oh, I see. Thank you for explaining that.
-	-	Well more sense based on what we already know about the universe... but you're right, it's not like we have a vast amount of knowledge either way. 
0	2	I think that's wrong. I think far away galaxies do move away faster than lightspeed, or else the known matter would all be in a circle of max. 15 billion lightyears. Space-time is being warped by galactic masses and as such space and matter cannot be regarded as separate entities that don't influence each other.
0	1	Dark matter is not mysterious. It is matter which does not interact electromagnetically. We don't have confirmation of what specifically it is yet, but that doesn't mean ooh maybe it's not matter after all!  Similarly, dark energy is not as mysterious as you imagine. It can't "not even be energy", if you work out the math then there's an energy term associated with accelerating metric expansion. It's very possible that dark energy is a *consequence* of something more interesting than "well it's just there because because", but that doesn't mean we completely don't understand what's going on.
0	1	Actually, I was kinda hoping a physicist would come in and explain why I'm wrong, and that would have been the best comment in the thread.
0	2	Are you confusing dark matter and dark energy? The two are pretty much opposite in their effects.
1	4	Well, the interesting thing here isn't so much that dark energy is constant as that it doesn't "spread out" with metric expansion. Which is true of all dark energy models (admittedly, there is quite a bit of variety in them).
-	-	This sounds to me like it is a property of spacetime itself. Maybe it gives us a hint of what lies beneath. Maybe all this is just a bubble in a bigger system with constant temperature.
-	-	I was of the impression that dark energy was pretty much the same as vacuum pressure - the pressure formed by virtual particles popping in and out of existence all the time, and responsible for the Casimir effect. Is this not the case at all, or is this one of the ideas that just hasn't been demonstrated as fully as I thought?
1	8	dark energy grows in strength as the universe expands. Im sorry that seems "weird" to you. However, the universe doesnt really care what you find weird or not. 
1	4	dark energy is a really fascinating  phenomenum.  The universe started with a big bang, and it was always assumed the galaxies would slow down their rate of expansion as time went on due to gravity pulling on them. Instead we find they are flying apart at faster and faster rates. Decidedly NOT like a typical explosion. What is pushing them faster and faster apart? I dont know, but all the good comments on this are buried at -2. enjoy your karma. 
-	-	of course f=ma is a universal law. If a mass  is accelerating then by definition a force must be acting on it. Masses dont accelerate by magic in this universe. The masses in this case would be the galaxies. 
-	-	Actually, gravity is also caused by the presence of energy (thank you Einstein).  So, dark matter *could* be a huge amount of energy, but the problem with that is it would have to be a form of energy that is weakly interacting... 
0	1	Nah, not the case at all.   But when someone says that there's a 0% chance of something happening, I have to call bullshit on their scientific literacy.   You (and I, and everyone) make assumptions every day about how the world works. Please don't call our questions or assumptions (or "hypothesis") "oogly boogly".   I mean, if I wanted real, accurate answered to these questions, I certainly wouldn't be asking reddit -  I'd be asking someone who is trained in the field (and please don't say, "Well, I have a PhD in quantum blah blah").

-	-	I'm waiting for the patch where they nerf the extra dimensions.
0	2	Thanks for following up a dumbass comment with a smartass comment.
-	-	Erm... no, F=ma is not some sort of universal law. Nor can you apply it to metric expansion (what in the *world* would you use for mass?)
-	-	But you can't just have "pure energy" floating around; energy exists only as the energy *of* something. It could be the energy of some yet to be discovered field, which for some reason clumps around galaxies, but that's not really a reasonable thing to postulate.
0	2	It's a 0% chance because it *doesn't make sense*. In order to ask the question "is it possible that the Higgs field and dark energy will be unified" as though it is meaningful, you have to not understand what either of them is. Not knowing things isn't some sort of horrible sin, but you can't pretend that your uninformed opinion is equivalent to anyone else's informed opinion.

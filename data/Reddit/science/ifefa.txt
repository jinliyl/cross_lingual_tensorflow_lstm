-	-	In brief: I do consider Mr. Hogan's findings real, because they're fitting the AWT predictions well. I even do consider the findings of Integral satellite real, because they're fitting the AWT predictions well.   I just do believe, these two findings are actually orthogonal, their results don't exclude each other because of double negation. Because just the CMBR noise is the reason, why the gamma bursts are getting polarized and subsequently dispersed in the way, they don't exhibit any macroscopic polarization at the very end. The physicists were just fooled with the fact, whole that burst arrived at Earth in the single moment, because all its photons are attracting mutually - so that gamma burst doesn't appear dispersed. But in fact it was dispersed and shaken so well, it even did lost its temporal polarization - got it?   With formal math it's virtually impossible to reveal or follow these subtleties in 3D - you just have an illustrative insight into reality. You should compose six-dimensional model of gamma ray spreading through dispersive environment to linearise the situation. In such hyperdimensional space the vortex ring would spread like the flat soliton with  reference frame defined. The additional two dimensions are actually curled, i.e. compactified inside the vortex ring, which is forming the gamma ray burst during its travel through vast cosmic space. The travelling vortex ring is forming so-called the T-duality, which is describing the closed strings of string theory.  From macroscopic perspective we are observing so-called the autofocusation of EM wave with vacuum. The same phenomena can be observed in material environments with much weaker waves at much shorter distances, inside of so-called the metamaterials in particular. The light is dispersed with metamaterial in such strange way, it appears focussed, although it's moving in much slower way, than inside of homogeneous material (i.e. its actually strongly dispersed). The common denominator of such behaviour in both vacuum, both metamaterials is the foamy structure of environment, which is both focussing, both dispersing the transverse waves due the presence of density fluctuations of both positive, both negative curvature. So that the behaviour of gamma rays in vacuum can even learn us about solid state physics too - aether models are interdisciplinary.
0	1	&gt; In a nutshell, GEO600 -- a mindbogglingly sensitive piece of kit -- started to detect what particle physicist Craig Hogan interpreted as quantum "fuzziness." This fuzziness, or blurriness on the smallest possible scales, could be interpreted as evidence for the "holographic universe" hypothesis.  &gt; However, as announced this week, a space-borne European satellite that should be able to measure these small scales too, doesn't appear to be registering any quantum fuzziness. In fact, it has yet to detect anything quantum, indicating that spacetime's "graininess" is composed of quanta that a lot smaller than predicted  God, I love science.  "Hey, look at these results! The universe is fucking weird and we may have to rethink all our theories about its underpinnings!"  "No, look at my results! Your results are completely bogus! The universe is fucking weird and we may have to rethink all our theories about its underpinnings in *exactly the opposite direction*!
0	5	Not exactly.  It's more like:    - "Hey, guys, you know, this noise at the edge of detection _could_ be interpreted to support my pet theory of the universe!"   - "Nah, there is no noise at that frequency if you use this other instrument with higher sensitivity. Sorry."
0	1	What is this shit?  Who is upvoting you?  How is any testable hypothesis that fits known facts and provides new questions to test "thoroughly gonzo?"  How has it been thoroughly debunked?  Did you even read this simplified article about it, in which they clearly state that these results are by no means definitive?  I assure you that your universe will remain incomprehensible and baffling at all levels if you go around thinking in black and white about things you have absolutely no idea about.

1	4	I have been thinking about our inherent aversion to phenomena whose scales are much different than the phenomena that we can directly observe.  My last physics class was 25 years ago, so maybe I'm ignorant of some theoretical basis for the idea of an absolute lower limit, but from a philosophical perspective why should we have any expectation that we are getting close to the smallest scale of physical phenomena?    Going in the opposite direction: we already know that the universe is absurdly huge from our perspective.  As I wrestled with the implications of the theory that new copies of the universe are quantum-splitting from each other at a furious pace, producing a tremendous number of new huge universes, I got overwhelmed thinking about where all this stuff could be coming from.  It just seemed like "too much" stuff.  But then I thought, "So what?  The universe is already known to be mind-bogglingly huge.  What if it is (mind-boggling X mind-boggling) huge?"  Our poor minds are very very boggled, but the real universe is not concerned about that.  So the results of this study make me wonder the same kind of thing, but in the direction of smallness.  Maybe someday we'll laugh at ourselves for being taken in by this window of small scales in which everything seemed to be very quiet and uniform.  Well, most of that was caffeine talking.  Thanks for reading.

1	6	The universe could be a fractal with an infinite smallness?
-	-	Will this fix my printer?
-	-	No, because it's more accurate to say:  "Well, didn't see any quantum fuzziness at scale X, Y or Z. Therefore, if it exists then it must be even smaller."
0	2	In AWT the universe is composed of density fluctuations of inhomogeneous material environment, so called the aether. But these density fluctuations are nothing, then just fractal curvatures of space-time. Because even the AWT has no better explanation for matter, then the space-time curvature. Aether is just a concept of particle gas, which enables us to predict at least something from the complex behavior of such space-time curvatures.  In this way, we are formed with space curvatures within space curvatures, which corresponds the illusion of the illusion. It's simply some probability field of random events. You can try to interpret it like space-time or like material or energy field, but you will always get stuck in some kind of circular reasoning again. We simply don't know, what this shit is all about - it's simply randomness in all its glory. But it's not nothing, because nothing has no other attributes, than just its nullity - and the Universe is apparently pretty rich! This randomness is surprisingly easy to model with nested fluctuations of particle gas, but I consider this behaviour as an anthropocentric artefact of reality. The most distant universe just mirrors the behaviour of most intrinsic reality right before our eyes. It's the common behavior of every particle environment: for example the random spreading of ripples at the water surface at the larger distance imitates the behaviour of the Brownian noise at the short distances. The Universe is just substantially larger analogy of such mirroring.  But we shouldn't be surprised with virtualness of our reality very much. For example, recently I read the article about evolution of cooking recipes, which are evolving in time spontaneously like living organisms. But not in real environment, but in virtual environment of cooking books. The same aspects of spontaneous uncontrolled evolution we can observe in many areas of human activity, where many conditions and requirements compete for their fitness like random mutations. We people have no good control over such evolution, because it's influenced with many factors from outside (fluctuations of financial markets, for example) - so that the human society serves as a rather passive virtual environment of this evolution, despite it's willing to admit or not.

-	-	Well lets consider the black holes. According to latest theories all information is retained at the black hole surface. Now if you venture inside the event horizon you could spend considerable time (local time) before you are spaghettified. Moreover, passing the event horizon from your perspective would be actually, well uneventful. Once inside, given time you could build a civilization that ponders a question: is it all just a hologram? Mind you that basic laws of nature that are valid outside the black hole are still in effect (otherwise you wouldn't even exist), yet all information is contained on the surface of event horizon ( I believe it is a surface we are talking about).  Now, is it a hologram or not?
-	-	I remember seeing a comment back then that they don't mean a virtual world with "hologram".
1	6	Interesting. One of my first science-for-the-layman books was *Holographic Universe* by Michael Talbot. Still a great book, IMHO.
0	1	ENHANCE!
-	-	Is it just me or are popsci articles actively trying to elicit emotional responses like "omg nothing is real, we live in the matrix" or "phew, the universe is real after all"?  Whether or not the universe behaves (or can be modeled) as though it was a projection from a lower dimensional space/manifold is completely orthogonal to the question of whether the universe is "real", and meaningless in real life (except for the possibility that the deeper understanding of physics might bring us new technologies).  It's all just mathematical models attempting to describe what we are observing.
0	1	Zoom!  Enhance!
1	4	nice ranting there.
-	-	As I just explained bellow, from AWT follows, the holographic noise is actually formed with gravitational waves and it corresponds the CMBR noise at the same moment. This finding is actually supported even with general relativity - the silly physicists are just refuting to admit it. Why?  It's because the relativists actually do not work with exact form of Einstein's field equations at all. Relativists are using a simplified form of Einstein field equations to calculate various aspects of the gravitational field, including the gravitational waves, which are based on so-called the Einstein's pseudo-tensor. This simplified form is called the linearised field equations. They're doing this, because Einstein's field equations are highly non-linear (implicit actually) and impossible to solve analytically (it's not so difficult to understand it - and I can explain it sometimes later). So, the mathematicians are using the simplified linearised form, because they're assuming, that they can do so ("*..hey - nothing is actually wrong on linearisation of physical models, does it?*"). However Hermann Weyl proved in 1944 already, that linearisation of the field equations implies the existence of a Einstein's pseudo-tensor that, except for the trivial case of being precisely zero, does not otherwise exist. How we could understand this result with our limited redditing brains?  As Eddington pointed out already before many years, gravitational waves do not have a unique speed of propagation, because the speed of the alleged waves is coordinate dependent. A different set of coordinates yields a different speed of propagation and such waves would propagate like the noise. It can be even understood intuitively, because the gravitational wave are just the density gradients of space-time. And just this gradient - or curvature - can serve as a reference frame in general relativity. In flat space-time you have nothing to handle as a fixed point of space, so to say - such space-time is simply empty. So you're trying to define the gravitational wave position with the reference frame, which is formed with this position itself. In formal math such situation is called a singular condition, in predicate logic it's what the circular reasoning is called, i.e. the tautology. Such tautology is easy to follow conceptually, but it's pretty difficult task inside of  complex tangle of formal equations. No wonder, the formally thinking people have difficulties to realize it. Until their equations produce at least something, they're happy with it, because they need to write publications..  Briefly speaking, the gravitational waves are artefact resulting for simplification of general relativity models for the sake of their resolvability with high school math. Such artefacts aren't rare in contemporary theoretical physics at all - for example the Higgs boson is an artefact of the same category. Physicists have the nonexistence of luminal gravitational waves explained already at both qualitative, both quantitative level - they're just not willing to accept it and we are paying them their research, while the cold fusion or superconductivity research is ignored and delayed many years. This ignorance costs more money, than just the price of gravitational detectors and salaries of physicists involved.
1	4	The AWT models space-time with water surface, the light waves with surface ripples and the gravitational waves with underwater sound waves. It's evident, these waves are spreading much faster, then the surface ripples, so they manifest with tiny chaotic noise at the water surface. In AWT the analogy of underwater waves is well known CMBR noise, which is observed routinely during last fifty years (and which actually everyone of us can detect with his analogue TV set).  The holographic theory considers, our world is a five-dimensional projection from surface of black hole, where we are living in. Such projection can work only when the projective waves are highly superluminal, or it couldn't create the photons with such projection. This aspect have both holographic, both AWT theory in common - I'm just not quite sure, if holographists are realizing it and accepting the existence of tachyons in their theory.  Anyway, despite you're believing in tachyons or not, the underwater nuclear bomb explosion enables us imagine, what we would see during passage of such superluminal waves through our local area of space-time with using of water surface model. We should expect the sudden increase of the background noise from all directions, which correspond the passage of underwater shock wave along water surface. Analogously, Mr. Hogan deduced, the passage of holographic wave shouldn't manifest itself like some periodic wave, but like the less or more sudden change of background noise intensity. And he even believed, he succeeded in observation of such event at the GEO600 detector before some years.  But the holographic theory still differs from AWT, as Mr. Hogan doesn't consider the CMBR as a holographic noise, which he is actually trying to detect. Because lower frequencies are occupied with alleged gravitational waves of classical general relativity, he actually seeks for his "holographic noise" at somewhat higher frequencies, just to avoid the interference with CMBR background.  In such way, these crazy physicists are trying to avoid just the phenomena, which they're supposed to detect. Such situation is not quite exceptional in mainstream physics. Anyway, we can observe some convergence to AWT model here, because the holographic noise is searched at substantially higher frequencies, than the "classical" gravitational waves of general relativity.
1	6	The article above linked is about zero result of polarization during gamma ray burst. It actually doesn't disprove holographic model from single reason: the quantum CMBR noise is real, it's not an illusion. IMO this zero result follows from another artefact, which is just a consequence of mirroring our classical reality into most distant areas of universe.  As you probably know, the contemporary mainstream physics is driven with pair of mutually dual theories, with quantum mechanics (QM) and general relativity (GR). The GR considers conservation of macroscopic quantities of light spreading, like the speed of light. The QM considers the conservation (quantization) of microscopic qualities of light, for example the spin of photon.  Because these two theories mutually complement each other, the physicists are developing new metatheories, based on these two theories. Currently the most popular are string theory (ST) and loop quantum gravity theory (LQG), which are both based on different postulate set of QM an GR. The ST is more QM oriented and it considers constant speed of light, extra dimensions and it considers the particles as a low-dimensional strings and membranes, i.e. it's oriented to the description of particles. The LQG is a field theory oriented to GR instead. It doesn't care very much about particles and extradimensions, instead of it it considers the vacuum as a stringy mesh of loops, i.e. spin mesh. With respect to AWT, these two theories complement each other in similar way like the GR and QM itself - just in wider extent by principle of AdS/CFT correspondence.  When the photons of different wavelength are spreading through quantum foam forming the vacuum, these two theories predict different violation of GR and QM. The ST considers the constant speed of light, so it cannot predict the variable speed of light for different wavelengths. Instead of this it can predict, the light will change its polarization while traveling at large cosmological distances. The LQG doesn't care about polarization light too much, but it predicts, the light of different wavelengths will travel through quantum foam with different speed: the shortwavelenght light will follow surfaces of spin foam, so it will travel slower in similar way, like the blue light travels slower through dispersive environment. Red light penetrates such environment faster, because it's not dispersed with it too much (from the same reason the fog lights are yellow and morning sky is red).  The prediction of both theories work well, when the distance for light remains low and/or the energy density of light remains low. For example, we are observing the polarization or Doppler's anisotropy of microwave radiation at the distant areas of Universe. In the same way, we can observe the polarization of gamma radiation near black holes (like the Cygnus X1) or we can observe the delay between long wavelength and shortwavelenght portions of near gamma ray bursts, like the MKN 501. For these situations the LGQ/ST work reasonably well.  The problem arises, when we are observing the light at both vast cosmic distances, both high energy density (gamma radiation). The proponents of both ST or LQG theories are expecting, in such situations their corrections will become quite apparent. But the exactly the opposite is true: in such situations the corrections predicted with both theories compensate mutually and we can observe anything again. For example in distant GRB 090510 whole burst arrived at Earth at the single moment. And at the case of distant GRB 041219A no polarization was observed.  AWT (dense aether theory) explains, what happens there with using of analogy with fluid mechanics. The GR says, the light has no mass, it only transfers momentum. The reason is, for photons the reference frame in space-time is not defined in GR, because for such photons the time effectively stops. But in AWT the gravity field of objects spreads much faster, than the speed of light. Even photons have gravity field around them, especially these shortwavelength ones. Therefore a bunch of gamma ray photons doesn't propagate through vacuum independently, they're attracting and revolving mutually like asteroids inside of giant vortex ring. The heavier photons are collected at center of resulting cluster, whereas these longwavelength ones are revolving them. In this way, the longwavelength photons are traveling along longer path (thus fulfilling the LQG prediction), but the whole cluster arives at Earth in single moment (thus fulfilling the expectations of ST). The mutual revolution of photons inside of gamma burst cluster destroys their polarization too.  The formation of vortex rings from photons is not new feature, the same effect we can observe during spreading of light through boson condensates. We can say, the vacuum density fluctuations are behaving with respect to gamma rays like the atoms inside of boson condensates with respect to visible light. The vortex rings of light, which are formed here are illustrating, how the photons would appear at quantum scale. We could say, the vortex rings of gamma ray bursts are forming normal photons inside of giant hyper-universe.

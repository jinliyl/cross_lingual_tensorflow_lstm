0	1	And now we're back to a soy problem? I kid... I kid...
-	-	Not quite:       1 tsp of soy sauce = [335mg of sodium](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4391/2)      1 tsp of Brigg's Liquid Amino = [320mg of sodium](http://www.bragg.com/products/laFAQ.html#la_faq2e)         The difference if negligible.     edit: Bragg's, not Brigg's.
-	-	Same here. Last time I checked, it takes a LOT of legumes to chew to make up for a piece of fish. Like, a whole plateful of beans. 
-	-	So toss a bag of pre-marinated tofu in it too, not that big a deal. You really don't need much protein to live if you aren't an athlete or something
-	-	Come off your high horse, I bet when you read posts about somebody mistreating a dog like Michael Vick or that recent guy who asked for advice about his neighbor abandoning pets, you don't get all morally relativistic.
-	-	That's a lot of protein (150 grams for a 150-pound person). I think 1 gram per kilogram (about 68 grams for a 150-pound person) would be a more standard recommendation. It would take some hunting, but I seem to recall a study a few years ago that said you can't even digest and absorb more than about 20 grams of protein per meal.
-	-	I don't know about most beans, but I mostly do not eat beans from a can.  But I do use a pressure cooker, which speeds up the cooking, and actually makes them come out better.  I don't eat much canned food at all.  But you're not really making fair comparisons when you compare plain beans to marinated and prepared meats.  You can slap a burger, chop, or steak on a grill and have it done in 10 minutes or so with no marinating if you want; also, you can chop onions, etc to add to beans, and make a sauce if you desire.  Whether you like meat or not, it's pretty hard to say it's harder to cook with a straight face.  By the way, it sounded like you misunderstood what I meant by complete proteins; I mean all the essential amino acids, which I don't think is something everyone simply knows.  Animal products have all the amino acids, but most vegetable products are missing some, so you need to eat certain combinations, or at least that's what I learned back in the dark ages when I tried it - before the days of Whole Foods, Amy's Kitchen, etc.  In fact, if I hadn't lived in Berkeley, I doubt that I would have been able to find many of the things I ate.  We did have Wholly Foods back then, but no Whole Foods. :)
1	6	Oh?  So what's the recommendation this week?
-	-	Look into glycemic index and glycemic load
-	-	I actually prefer the flavor of Bragg's to soy sauce in non-Asian style dishes, though I must confess that I dilute the Bragg's with water (1:1) and pour it into a [spray bottle](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?sku=11318517&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=shopping).
-	-	False. Look at what Bragg's considers to be a "serving size."
-	-	So, they picked 7 studies that showed a benefit of consuming whole grains, did a meta-analysis and showed less cardio disease in people who consumed 2.5 servings of whole grains **per day** when compared to those who ate less than 2 **per week**.     I question the quality of these results. First, it's a meta-analysis of hand-picked studies. Second, as I stated above, whole-grain intake is associated with a healthier lifestyle in general. That, in order to see these kinds of results, they had to compare a group who consumed **8 times** as many whole grains seems questionable to me, especially in light of the fact that that the  Iowa Women's Health Study referenced in the same article showed no decreased mortality from cardiac disease associated with whole grain consumption.
-	-	Beans take longer than a pork chop, if you don't eat canned stuff.  You can get canned meat, too, if you like that sort of thing.  Also, as a vegetarian, you need to make sure you get complete proteins, don't you?  And certain other nutrients that are hard to get if you don't eat meat.  I've been a vegetarian, and found that it was definitely more work.  I like to cook, so I didn't really mind, but when I had a job that required a lot of time, I gave up on it.  Maybe now it's easier to find vegetarian fast food for working people, though.
-	-	I'm a vegetarian.  All my local grocery stores sell *nothing* but soy-based meat substitutes.  No seitan.  If I want seitan, I have to hunt down an independant veg-friendly grocer, or I have to DIY it.  Which is fine, seitan tastes awesome and home-made is much better.  But, as I said upthread, it's much more work than the old pre-veg days when I could just throw a cut of meat onto the George Forman grill and have something awesome-tasting with almost zero work.  &gt; Debatable to say the least  TFA basically says "The risks are overstated, but you shouldn't eat too much soy".  Which is my point.  I'm not arguing abandoning soy altogether, but moderation is a good idea.  And in my area, grocery stores are 100% using soy for protein in their meat substitutes.  No boca burgers, no qorn, no seitan.
0	1	I hate to say it, but you're going to find it impossible to get enough protein on a vegan diet if you do manual labor. You physically can not eat 1 gram of protein for every 1 lb of your own weight per day if the protein is coming from lentils, believe me I've tried.   But yeah, if your not mowing lawns or building houses, a vegan diet isn't hard. The food you mentioned sounds great btw. I'm hungry now!
1	6	Wow.  We eat almost opposite diets.  I eat a primal diet that's high fat consisting of lots of high quality meats.  I eat as close to zero grains as I can (but I do like them so I eat some).  I stay away from anything with sugar in it other than things like fruit (I dig on berries mostly and stay away from fruit juices which have high sugar ratios).  I also have no problem eating dairy, cheese etc. but I stick with the high fat or high protein stuff.  I eat plenty of healthy fats like avocado, coconut oils, butter etc.  I do eat a limited amount of nuts but I don't go crazy.  I stay away from hydrogenated oils and oils with high omega 6's that are pro inflammatory.  In general I stay away from processed anything or fast food of any kind.  I don't generally eat frozen food (sometimes frozen berries never something like a lean cuisine).  I do drink wine, mostly red high in resveratrol (and flavor).    Basically pretty much what Mark Sisson (marksdailyapple.com) recommends.    
-	-	How would the protein content be in such a meal?
0	5	Grains.  I love how I've been downvoted, obviously by my fellow vegetarians who are grumpy about being reminded how much easier it is to be a meat eater.  I didn't give up meat because I thought it would be fun and easy.  I gave it up because it was right, and probably healthy.  Anyhow, the big thing about protein sources is that the various weird and tasty grains that meat eaters ignore like beans and lentils and quinoa all contain partial proteins.  Proteins are tricky because they need a Voltron-like combination of a "complete" protein to actually work.  Quinoa is a rice-like grain that is unique in the grain world for providing such a complete protein - try it as a substitute for rice in your next stir-fry or whatever.  Otherwise, in general mix one of the traditional grains (bread, rice, whatever) with one of the heartier grains (beans, lentils, chickpeas) is the rule of thumb I've been taught.  Felafel is actually good because it contains both.  There's also seitan, which is wheat gluten - obviously not an option for celiacs.  It's a wonderful meat substitute in both taste and protein content.  Sadly, in this savage wasteland of Ontario it's pretty hard to find in a pre-packaged form.
-	-	Legumes of all types (lentils, black eyed peas, black beans, lima beans, peas, fava beans, kidney beans, etc.)  Nuts of all types  Seeds of all types (pumpkin, sunflower, sesame, flax, etc.) 
-	-	Beans.
-	-	The ultimate vegan diet. Go out into space, fuse carbon from ambient hydrogen, forge it into rings and construct amino acids and sugars, then enjoy your meal.
1	4	Yay, so we've replaced our fat problem with a sodium problem.  Brilliant!
0	5	I'm confused as to what you're referring to there, you're seeing things in my posts that don't exist. Where in my posts have I associated myself with the paleotards? Militant paleos are just as bad as militant vegans in my eyes and whilst I share some dietary principles with them, I generally think that 90% of the people who actually identify themselves as 'paleo' are fucking morons. If anything you've demonstrated the fact that reality does not match your distorted perceptions.  Maybe I should clarify my position. I've got nothing against the china study itself, outside of the fact it's only an epidemiological study and as such can't be used for anything other than generating hypotheses. I just believe that Campbells interpretation of the data is flat out wrong. That the data just does not support his conclusions.  
-	-	High Protein Diet is very bad for the Heart. Ask a Bodybuilder with experience. They have been experimenting with this for a long time.
0	2	Someone needs to tell me which delivery food to eat. Cooking is for boring people.
1	4	That's cool. Cannabis has been doing this for years without a diet change.
1	4	Wow.  This is really significant.  Combine it with the studies suggesting lower carb intake reducing heart disease and diabetes and the personal health reasons for avoiding meat a la vegetarianism get that much less convincing.
1	4	Steak is good for you.
0	5	I'm Irish. I *live* on beer and potatoes. This is the worst news ever. :(
-	-	Relevant 2011 review on caloric restriction, cancer, and chemotherapy http://www.nature.com/onc/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/onc201191a.html tl;dr: Chemotherapy works on dividing cells.  Caloric restriction slows healthy cell division, but not cancer cell division.  Thus, Chemotherapy becomes more selective for cancer cells during caloric restriction.
0	2	Can we just give up on the low-carb thing already? This is getting ridiculous. 
-	-	Here's some further reading from Harvard School of Public Health:  http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/health-gains-from-whole-grains/  Note: "How Do Whole Grains Do This?"
-	-	So it comes to this does it, Cancer or French Fries? God has a dark sense of humor.
-	-	Vegetables and fruits are carbohydrates. Bacon is protein.  Has anyone read The China Study?
-	-	And we are all made of stars.  QED eating white dwarfs cures cancer (watch out wee man)
-	-	This was tested in young-adult male mice. It wasn't tested in females because they respond differently to the diet due to the fact that they have higher estrogen than male mice (Figure 1A shows that they actually hardly show any decrease in blood glucose levels at all).   There is indeed slowing of tumor growth. The tumors reach the same size about 2 -3 days later than on a more normal diet - this on a total timescale of 20 days.   The diet prevents cancer initiation only in a certain mouse model where the mice spontaneously develop cancers. I don't think the survival curves look much different, and overall survival doesn't differ much - apparently the mice on the special diet have a habit of dying of something other than cancer. (They should have drawn the survival curve different, perhaps, to only reflect cancer incidence and not overall survival as they do now). Oh, and only 10 mice on each diet, so a total of 20. 
0	1	God bless AACR and their free-to-download journals.  In unrelated news, fuck you very much, EBSCOHost.
-	-	Show my your thesis and proof of your doctorate.
-	-	&gt;increasing protein rather than fat levels because of the reported tumor-promoting effects of high fat and the immune-stimulating effects of high protein  AND low fat diet.  Sorry bacon.
-	-	The alternative people include almost everybody except you.  Rather a large box to draw around a group for attributing an opinion.  I have a feeling "the alternative people" have more than just one opinion.
-	-	It doesn't but the alternative people have suggested low-protein diets for cancer care based on their "I have this gut-feeling" intuition.
-	-	Which is one of the reasons why a lot of companies are switching their research to China.   Not such a big problem there.
0	2	I work in cancer biology as a doctorate student.  Mouse models are pretty horrible but I'm not arguing they don't serve a purpose. Whopping conclusions shouldn't be drawn from them.  For instance, thermal ablation using gold nanoshells does not cure cancer. It cures cancer in mice that have a tumor 1 cm from the surface of their skin. Yet this headline about the miracle of nanoparticles is ubiquitous in cancer research.  No evidence exists that this can be used in humans with any such degree of sucess. These studies shed some light on possible actions for future therapy. They do not, however, reveal things such as " A Low Carbohydrate, High Protein Diet Slows Tumor Growth and Prevents Cancer Initiation".  They might suggest that this is a possibility, but certainly a murine tumor model does not show that in humans a low carb diet slows tumor growth. It doesn't even come close to that.  Diet studies are particularly flawed in murine models, given that the diet of mice and humans aren't remotely similar.  It's stupid to make headlines on reddit that are so misleading.  Feel free to have a different opinion.
-	-	Grams of carbohydrate per day.
-	-	Grams carbohydrates per day.   EDIT: Fixed
-	-	I will never, ever trust anything from vegans or vegetarians for the simple fact that their beliefs are ideologically based. Their interests lay in promoting a life style. It's like learning about evolution from a church. 
-	-	&gt;I think you're not seeing the larger point made in this article, that wholegrains can be beneficial to health in varying ways.   Well, *perhaps* - when they replace refined grains. My issue is I'm not seeing any studies on the benefits/detriments of forgoing grains altogether that would prove/disprove that "whole grains" are responsible for the differences seen in all these epidemiological observations.  &gt;These studies come from good sources and I don't see the reason for them to cherry pick data as you imply. The sample size on them was over 27,000.    They are still food frequency questionnaire epidemiological studies. They cannot and should not be used to determine a causal relationship between consumption of various nutrients and disease; they should be used only as the basis for later clinical studies.    &gt;you are not providing any counter evidence   Fair enough...     http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7816745   http://www.jacn.org/content/20/1/50.short   http://cerealchemistry.aaccnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/CCHEM-87-2-0167?journalCode=cchem   
0	2	NUTS TASTE NOTHING LIKE CHEESE, BLASPHEMER.
-	-	Aren't lentils, quinoa and legumes starchy?  I know sweet potatos are starchy.  How does this remain low carb?
-	-	this just means that you spent a lot of time cooking pre-vegan. The dude's saying that you can throw a steak on a grill and eat it. The end.  Clearly your preparation takes more time than that. It's not a shot at being a vegan, it's just obviously true.
-	-	Kinda hate when some vegs saturate their comments with the snobby patronizing moral high ground...don't you? :)
0	5	Sorry, can't.  After the HPV vaccine gave me late-onset autism, my parents cured it and made me immune to cancer with a homeopathic arsenic and honey mixture.  You know how it is.
-	-	But a grilled steak isn't anything like a complete diet.  In my experience with both diets (former vegan, current high protein meat eater), to get the balance of protein/carb/fat and the other nutrients you need, either diet will take about the same meal prep time.  If the prep time is the number one factor in your diet, then you're probably not trying to address any specific health or fitness goals, which is completely fine, but not what everyone is going for.
-	-	Or you just toss a few scoops of rice / pea protein powder into a blender with some berries and peanut butter and water and have a protein shake with as much protein as you want in 2-3 minutes.
1	4	Yes, thanks for RTFA, Dr. Warburg is mentioned in the very first sentence of the paper.
-	-	Could you please elaborate on your experience?  I've started to avoid sugars long ago, and my body seems to "ask for" carbs less and less, but I'm a bit scared that by eliminating, or greatly reducing, everything that has carbs, may have some ill effect on my health. 
-	-	You can cure AIDS in a petri dish too - doesn't mean it works that way in the human body.  Cancer is a catch-all term for a huge variety of illnesses, many of which have *nothing* to do with your dietary choices.
-	-	&gt; I "knew" that for a long time.  You mean you're going to take the headline and use it as justification for your life choices?
-	-	[deleted]
-	-	So no fruits? I'm not trolling just curious as I am considering avoiding carbs as well.
0	1	No. Fat is good for you. Low fat is bullshit.
-	-	&gt; However, we kept fat levels in the range of a Western diet (23%) rather than the 50% used in the Atkins diet because of the tumor-promoting effects of high fat (13, 14), and raised the level of protein instead  Amounts of fat were consistent in both the groups' diets (not a high fat diet), modeled after the amount of fat in a typical Western diet.  Here are the macronutrient breakdowns:   &gt;                      CHO    Protein   Fat   &gt;     TestDiet 5058    55.2   23.2      21.6   &gt;     8%  CHO          8.0    69.4      22.6     (slowest tumor growth, and weight loss) &gt;     15% CHO          15.6   58.2      26.2     (slow tumor growth,    no weight loss) &gt;     10% CHO          10.6   63.5      25.9     (slower tumor growth,  less weight loss)   Skipping down to the discussion...  &gt; Given the antitumor effects of ketones and ketosis (29), we measured plasma β-hydroxybutyrate and found that tumor-bearing mice on our 10% diet as well as NOP mice on our 15% CHO diet for many months had β-hydroxybutyrate levels similar to mice fed with Western diet (&lt;5 mg/dL; Supplementary Fig. S1), and substantially less than those reported for mice on NCKDs (∼15 mg/dL; refs. 27, 30). **This is consistent with very recent studies showing that ketosis requires high dietary fat (31) and suggests that ketosis does not contribute to the slower tumor growth we observe with our low CHO diets.**  
-	-	Don't forget that the study also avoided fat and used plant-based proteins.
-	-	DO NOT APOLOGISE FOR BACON.  BACON OWES NOTHING ANY APOLOGIES.   ALL HAIL THE BACON.
-	-	No idea.  I've never had their products.  THey're just a name that comes up often when I talk to veggies south of the border.
1	7	Units are important.
-	-	I mean a grilled steak with a side of steamed vegetables in microwave bag is pretty decent, and takes about 10 minutes
-	-	This is the problem right there. Health guides commonly say that a vegetarian diet requires more knowledge to get the right balance of proteins and starches. You don't even need to be an athlete—if you're just a gym goer trying to put on weight (e.g. &gt;1 g of proten per pound of body weight), or if you have a growing child, then knowing these details become critical.  It's undeniably a hurdle for converts to get through. If you grew up vegetarian or live with vegetarians, you can pick up this knowledge through osmosis. For everyone else, the right thing for advocates to do is to lower those hurdles, not insist that a vegetarian diet is just as easy to accomplish, when even FDA pamphlets say it isn't.
-	-	Low GI index is not the same as low carb.
-	-	I have a rice cooker and use this approach often but feel like you'd need a lot more for a permanent vegetarian diet. That being said I'm not looking to become a vegetarian
0	2	If you eat any major food group in excess you get fat or ill in some way. 
1	4	Right, because only fad diet salesmen make such absurd claims.  You have decided to pretend "the entire scientific community" is "militant vegan/veg circles" and that "paleo scammers" is "the entire scientific community".  But reality does not match your distorted perception.
-	-	1 bagel = 1 carb.
1	6	&gt; All my local grocery stores sell nothing but soy-based meat substitutes.  You may be in a different position locally (where do you live) but that's different than saying that the industry has standardized on something that it has not. Wheat gluten is actually the more popular protein source it's just tofu gets the press since it has a funny name.
1	4	This looks interesting, thank you for sharing!
-	-	Almost all animals except primates produce vitamin C.
-	-	lol that rebuttal was written by a person with no scientific of statistical qualifications and used only the popularised book "The China Study" and not the original study in which over 350 variables were assessed. 
1	7	That's an excellent start, thank you.   
-	-	Actually no, it is considered one of the biggest real world studies of dietary effects on disease ever done.
1	4	I'd be interested in reading a respected rebuttal. 
-	-	I don't know if you'd mind answering a question, but I've been trying to do the low carb, high protein diet for a while and am generally happy as I've felt pretty good and generally been less hungry. I would *love* to be eating less meat because it's gotten a little bland. I find soy absolutely disgusting (except in the form of edamame), so where the hell do you get other high protein vegetables? Is there a reference list or something?
-	-	&gt; Vegetarian cooking is a lot more work than making meat where you can just toss a pork chop into a pan.  Not really. "Cut open bag of chopped veggies, toss in pan with soysauce" instant stirfry.
-	-	I heartily concur and extra points for Alexander Woollcott.
-	-	Well, so is r/keto.
-	-	no to mention the fact that most veggies have so much fiber that any carb value is totally offset.  Fruits also have a great deal of fiber and are often rich in essential nutrients.  You're only going to get in to trouble with fruit if you're consuming only the juice and not the roughage. 
1	4	I like your optimism. 
-	-	I believe that the route molecule &gt; molecule interactions &gt; cell culture studies &gt; animal model &gt; human tests can bring us new treatment options for human diseases. Feel free to have a different opinion.
-	-	what's a carb/day?
1	4	Thanks :-)  Oh, the 20 mice in the last experiment were female.  The tumor growth experiment was done with two diets:   * 15% high amylose CHO, 58% protein, 26% fat (15% CHO) diet    for 5 mice (plus 5 control mice on a 5058 diet).  * 10% CHO  was also 5 mice (plus 5 controls on 5058 diet).  * Then another experiment with 15% CHO diet plus chemotherapy in total about 17 mice (17 mice on the 15% CHO diet, of which 9 received  a kind of chemotherapy).   I *do* think this article is interesting. And who knows in the future a cancer patient will receive a diet to support the effect of the chemotherapy. But I think there's still a lot to discuss and to investigate here. 
1	4	They are lucky they got use 20.. animal testing is rather hard to do depending on the government..
-	-	There could be cancer cell lines which react differently to proteins but in light of this study you can't help but to smile at the faith people.
0	1	shut your mouf.  your analogy with hybrid cars tells me how stupid you are.  
-	-	I, for one, am impressed that they got the mice to fill out the questionnaires.
-	-	Re. soy, I believe too much of anything is a bad thing, and as a vegan do not overdo soy intake (probably only marginally more than non-vegans, if more at all, as I don't eat all the processed snacks etc that have soy as an ingredient).  That said, the idea that soy is inherently bad is discussed in detail [here](http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/soy_harm) with many references to peer-reviewed, published studies and the conclusion is that it is not harmful and in some cases offers health benefits (especially as an alternative to animal proteins, risks overall are reduced)
-	-	Lost me mate. What's indirectly linked?
0	1	have u tried it asshole?  
-	-	There were concerns that people might have allergic reactions to the fungus it's made from.  They sell it in our local grocery store now, but I haven't tried it yet.  
1	4	I have an awesome large fancy pressure cooker that I've been using for nearly 20 years, and I have to say that cooking beans in it is tricky, since they foam up so much and tend to clog the valve, resulting in spraying down the kitchen if you don't have the temperature and amount of bean/water just right.  However, I limit our intake of canned beans due to BPA etc.  TIP: salt beans AFTER cooking, as salting them before makes them a little tough.
-	-	I live in Canada.  Never even *seen* Quorn.
0	2	Yes, yes.  You think you can completely cure cancer with the right foods, composing "natural health" but I am the foolish one.  I also foolishly don't believe in fairies in leprechauns.  My bad. 
-	-	Although you're correct, it does require specialized equipment. I get along fine boiling a giant pot and freezing huge amounts of beans 30-60s minutes later.
-	-	Isn't it more that a high carb diet *encourages* tumor growth?
-	-	[No Fusarium  protein being sold in big packets?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorn)
-	-	I think this conversation is so typical though. One of you says it's hard compared to cooking meat; the other says it isn't. You're just talking past each other.  To be frank it's taking you a 6 line paragraph to explain just one (pretty critical) aspect (what to do with beans) of getting enough protein through a vegetarian diet. That's the true cognitive overhead right there.
-	-	insane vegetarians have taken over the comment downvote-storm in here
0	2	&gt;You know they invented this process called canning  &gt;not very hard to sit down once a week, or every 10 days, and make a shitload of beans  You can say the same for meat.   &gt;You need to freeze meat or else it goes bad  You can  dry it or can it.
-	-	Buy a rice cooker. Get one of the ones which has a steamer on top to cook the vegetables at the same time you cook the rice.  It's literally set and forget - the cooker can sense when the food is done, and just turns off. I think it's even easier than microwaving.
-	-	&gt;if you aren't an athlete or something  But, you *should* be an athlete or something.  That's what all the longevity health studies show - exercise matters more than almost anything else.
-	-	It's for people who work out. I'm 5'8 135. The recommendation is 140–160g of protein per day, in order to build muscle mass. Yes, it's a lot higher than the federal RDA.  The max protein/meal is still under debate. A really common thing for lifters to do is to have 5-6 meals per day.
-	-	The Iowa study specifically excluded cardiovascular associations. I think you're not seeing the larger point made in this article, that wholegrains can be beneficial to health in varying ways.   Of course you are free to question the results but you are not providing any counter evidence, just your own opinion. These studies come from good sources and I don't see the reason for them to cherry pick data as you imply. The sample size on them was over 27,000.   However, for your own interest here is a large scale study of the benefits of wholegrains on CVD:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11000647 
-	-	you don't have to eat oats and sugars. 
-	-	Resorting to the old "Dietary advice changes sometimes, therefore we should disregard scientific approaches to nutrition" fallacy, are we?  There has *never* been any serious scientific evidence for the necessity of protein combining.  It was just an idea that sounded nice based on the assumption that humans needed protein sources comparable to animal proteins in order to survive.  Later it was discovered that we don't, and the entire premise upon which this hypothesis had been based was completely bogus.
0	2	&gt;Whether you like meat or not, it's pretty hard to say it's harder to cook with a straight face.  It is. Who actually cooks raw beans anymore? Nobody who isn't involved in some sort of project (like church or PTA or something) and they'll invest the time. I was responding to someone who was saying that it takes longer to cook veggies than meat, which is inaccurate. I can cook seitan on high heat and have it done in 5-7 minutes if I stay on top of it (which is about what you'd have to do to get the meat to cook within the ten minutes). Coming from the most common use-case for each product (canned for beans, raw for meat) it actually is noticeably faster to cook beans than a pork chop. There's no way you're getting that porkchop done in 10 minutes, but that's more than enough time to either nuke or simmer the canned beans.   [For example](http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2009/10/simple-pan-fried-pork-chops/): Prep Time: 10 Minutes  |  Cook Time: 5 Minutes  Personally, I think her times are a bit screwy (5 minutes less on prep, possibly five more on the actual cook) but the amount is about what I'd expect.  &gt;think is something everyone simply knows.  Vegetarians do. This is one of my pet peeves. It's not against omnis though, since it's probably just a fundamental flaw in our society that just finds a representation here, but there's the assumption that if one doesn't know about it then someone who has every reason _to_ know about it, probably still doesn't know. /rant  &gt;Animal products have all the amino acids, but most vegetable products are missing some  Slightly incorrect. You're about 80-90% on but it's an important 10% where you're off. "complete protein" is dietary shorthand for basically "if you eat this protein-possessing-food and your protein consumption equals the RDA, then you don't have to worry about the individual aminos since it's all in proportion with what your body needs to take in." In other words it's just a way of saying that you can go solely off of the grams of protein on the side of the box without having to research the food to make sure you're feeding yourself adequately.  One thing you might notice about that is that it says absolutely nothing about whether it has any of the amino acids. And if you look at the evidence most plants, especially those thought of as protein sources, actually do come pretty close to the  definition of "complete protein" but their proportions are off, so they can't claim the label. Gluten comes pretty close but Quinoa was actually proposed as being a food source for long-term space missions simply because it is so incredibly close to being a complete protein (I'll try to find the source for you after I post, if I can still find it). Soy is the only complete protein, but a protein being incomplete just means you have to complement it with something. Like beans/legumes are naturally complemented by Bread/pasta/rice (which is why wheat/rice and beans are both included in that enchilada I was referring to).  Long and short of it is: it's _kind of_ important if a food is a "complete protein" but it's not a big deal if it isn't, just need a rough understanding of what to pair it with (most veggies don't even worry _that_ much about it).  **EDIT::**  [This](http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1996/v3-632.html#Table_6) isn't the pdf I was thinking of when I wrote that but it does contain the information. For the proportions required for "complete protein" [see wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_protein). From the article:  &gt;&gt;The protein values increase and the relative proportions of amino acids meet or exceed the requirements of humans, except for cysteine and methionine.  Same article has (in kind of a weird basing) Cysteine at 14 miligrams and Methionine at 14 mili as well. I say weird because it gives grams per 100 grams which is basically in tens of miligrams (which is why I multiplied by ten to get them into a more usual denomination). At any rate that puts Methionine+Cystine at 28mg, but the Wikipedia says 25mg is the recommended amount. Seems like someone's math is a little off, not quite sure whose (hint: probably the page anybody can edit). At any rate it appears that there are only two limiting acids and we're down to the point where we have two (somewhat) reliable sources that are erroring on saying it has too much of the acids.  **EDIT #2::**  I think I figured out why the math didn't work out, they're probably going to have to grow them hydroponically but I was pulling from field growth. Hydroponically the Methionine+Cystine at 18mg which is 7mg below the requirement to be called a "complete protein".  **EDIT #3::**  Taking another look at the table it looks like they're saying Methionine+Cystine is too low even for field grown so maybe the wikipedia page is way off or something.
-	-	The common recommendation for people who want to maintain a high protein diet (body builders as the prime example) is 1 gram of protein/pound of *lean* body weight, so fat doesn't count.    Edit: and the "you can't absorb more than *x* grams of protein" is as far as I know a misunderstanding that belongs over in [/r/broscience](http://www.reddit.com/r/broscience). The study that is most commonly cited when saying this looks at protein synthesis, so even if it might be that you can only use 30 grams of protein/meal to build new muscle, but that doesn't mean the remaining protein can't be used for other things, like creating glucogen to fuel the cells.
0	1	that doesn't even make sense.  I didn't tell you that being a vegan is wrong. I told you to stop projecting your beliefs on others.  "Come off your high horse" would be something you would say to someone who thought they were more righetous than you, which is the position you're playing in this disccusion, not I. 
-	-	all the vegetarians downvote you for being against their religion
-	-	Don't forget about the french "paradox". Or the spanish and Cretan "paradoxes". I know we're not dogs, but look at what happens to meat-eaters like dogs if you feed them with vegetables and cookies, instead of fresh meat. They get fat, they lack energy and they get "our" diseases that you will hardly ever find in wild animals. Bottom line: there are quite many essential fats and proteins, but there are no essential carbohydrates whatsoever.
0	5	When I see "diet" or "light" foods that contain less fat but compensate for loss of flavour by adding extra sugar, I shed a tear.   
0	2	Some fat is good for you, but that only means that no fat is bullshit, low fat is not bullshit unless your bodyfat is low enough that you need more to be healthy..
-	-	The sugar in fruit is mostly fructose, and this article is concerned with glucose.
1	4	It depends on the fruit. Modern fruit has been bred to be "tree candy." Although it's not nearly as sweet as real candy, it's still pretty sweet. However, it does have fiber in it which lowers it's GI. 
-	-	disregard hippies, acquire animal proteins  brb, deadlifts
-	-	Nah, I don't need to justify this particular choice.  I need motivation from time to time, but a quick reminder of the results of my diet give me all the motivation I need.
-	-	yup! and not exactly news either - this is exactly what the China Study found years ago.   And of course Dr Esselstyn's work found the same for heart disease](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5215695644951404318). 
-	-	Problem with plant sourced protein is that the vegetarian-food industry has standardized on soy, which has its own problems thanks to its abundance of phytoestrogens.  I mean, you can DIY a lot of awesome protein-rich vegetarian foods, but sometimes there just isn't the time, y'know?  Vegetarian cooking is a lot more work than making meat where you can just toss a pork chop into a pan.
-	-	...for mice
1	6	It's amusing when scientists discover the exact opposite results to the "natural remedy" peoples' suggestions. People promoting diet as the cure for cancer have been claiming that a vegetarian low protein diet stops or reverses cancer growth. Right...
0	1	fuking bullshit.  the reason the person got cancer in the first place is due to bad diet.  a high protein diet slows(but doesn't stop it now does it?)  see how fuking insane this title is.  slow, but dont stop the tumor growth.   here's a fuking idea, how about we stop and cure the tumor.    every single fucking nation in this fuking world that eats meat and drinks milk have the highest rates of bone disease and disorder at elderly age.  and i submit to you that any nation in this world that eats starches and vegetables as primary source of food intake have the lowest rate of bone disease at elderly age.  gee whize, why do u think that is???  eating meat is DEADLY, it's highly acidic and strips the body of calcium.  so fuk off meat, fuck off you bacon eating redditards, and fuck this fake fail journal article.    and another thing, all you fake fuking go green trendy hipsters out there, if you REALLY want to decrease pollution, then stop eating meat.  
-	-	Do people still think carbohydrate is directly linked to fat? Fat is linked to fat, carbohydrate is linked to energy; if unused you get fat, the end. Everything in moderation; the west eats too much carb as it stands, but it's not as bad for your health as say salt or saturated fat which westerners also eat too much of. I think theres a vast misunderstaning as to what carbohydrate is and what it does to people. I also don't get why people were so eager to stop eating carbohydrate and not fat.
0	2	That study is flawed in many respects.   * Their definition and how they measured "low carb" would mean someone eating 150-200g carbohydrate/day was eating a low carb diet.   * They used food frequency questionnaires. Very crude method of gauging what people ate. Do you even remember what you ate one week ago?   * The authors only examined food intake once: at the start of the 20-plus-year study. If a person changed his diet at any point during the two-decade study it would not be reflected in the analysis.   * The risk ratios (hazard ratios) are MINISCULE. TINY. IF there is any effect at all, it is BARELY MEASURABLE, even if you have very good, very precise data. Which we don't. Most epidemiologists (legitimate ones, anyway) ordinarily don't consider an RR of less than 3.0 worth looking into. And even then, it's still a tenuous, weak, relationship at best. The RRs in this study were all like 1.25 or 0.95. In real world terms, basically nothing.   EDIT: Fixed units.
-	-	Although the sugar in fruit is fructose and some people claim fructose is bad, it seems like the fiber helps buffer some of the harm of sugar.  Also fruits are so full of other vitamins that it seems worth the trade off.  Further an apple is 100 calories.  It's really not that much carbohydrates.
-	-	Up vote to the comment, down vote the post. Lay person's need commenters like you to temper their reaction to science research.
1	4	Thanks, I wish I could give you more than one upvote.  While the science is interesting it's very preliminary - extrapolating a sweeping conclusion based 20 male mice is pretty damned silly.
1	4	I stand corrected. Though I might suggest that, since it has a very salty taste, you could use less of it and achieve the same amount of flavour.  But perhaps that's more appropriate for /r/fitness.
-	-	Huh...I guess I don't read enough alternative news to keep up on this stuff. 
-	-	How much faith do you have in that belief?
-	-	That's what you claim (I don't agree or disagree), but that's not what the paper is about.  Also, the response was to someone who said it's hard to eat low carb vegetarian.  (not low GI)
-	-	True. I still eat meat. But you also can't deny that beans are cheaper and better for the environment.
-	-	I see nobody has mentioned Quorn, the substitute I'VE standardized on. I once heard it's not as widely available in the U.S. because the FDA has some problems with it, or something. Is that true?
-	-	This was my first reaction, but digestion of nutrients other than carbohydrates often end up feeding the glycolysis pathway anyways, which is why a study like this is necessary.
1	6	Use the low-carb noodles and you absolutely can go there. Even with regular noodles, the GI is still pretty low. Amazing what can be considered healthy...
-	-	Works great for tough meats, too.
-	-	This study was done by avoiding meat..
-	-	You can have a low-carb vegetarian diet. I did that for a couple years.
-	-	the study uses plant-based proteins, when adding animal derived proteins, cancer grew. its not news though - this was found by Campbell in the 80s already.
-	-	&gt;Beans take longer than a pork chop, if you don't eat canned stuff. You can get canned meat, too, if you like that sort of thing.  Most beans eaten today, especially in a hurry, are from a can. But my point was more that if anything meat takes longer. Which porkchop do, you have to marinate and then grill, versus just boiling them in some water while you go do something else.  &gt;Also, as a vegetarian, you need to make sure you get complete proteins, don't you?  Only in so far as being a vegetarian implus cognition and thus sentience and thus humanity. Everyone needs to watch nutrients. It's actually very easy to get all the protein you need (you only need like 52 grams a _day_ of the stuff).   &gt;And certain other nutrients that are hard to get if you don't eat meat.  Such as...  &gt;I've been a vegetarian, and found that it was definitely more work.  Then, in the words of the internet, you're doing it wrong. It's more work in the sense that you can't go out to eat as often, but in the larger cities where the infrastructure is already in place for veggie diets, it takes exactly the same amount of work, in or out. You can order vegan pizza from pizza hut. That's if you're vegan. If you're only avoiding meats, you can have pizza, pasta, half of frozen foods, etc. The only thing is that your selection does get narrowed quite a bit if you don't live in a larger city.  &gt;Maybe now it's easier to find vegetarian fast food for working people, though.  Fast food, no, but convenience food, there is. Whole Foods carry virtually every product Amy's Kitchen puts out. If you don't know that's basically a line of food where 90% of it is vegetarian with the occasional vegan or omni dish. I can pick up a bean burrito for $2-3 bucks and a "Amy's whole meal" of black bean enchilada, refried pinto beans and spanish rice. With the beans, rice, and wheat (from the tortilla shell) I think that puts you at like 25-30 grams in a single meal. I'm kind of a larger guy so that's why I eat the whole meal and a burrito, but even together you're getting a full microwavable meal for around $5-6 which is fairly comparable to omni diets.   That said there are fast-casual restaurants like Atlanta Bread co and various "Middle eastern" fast food joints where you can get a meal in about 10 minutes for about $6-7. That's a little more expensive than your average omni meal but you have to also take into consideration that you're not doing it for financial reasons and so it just needs to be in the neighborhood.
0	1	Plus vegetarians are so snooty.
-	-	“All the things I really like to do are either illegal, immoral, or fattening”
-	-	Is it clear that starch would have the effect as sugar? It looks as if the researchers here didn't really try to distinguish between soda carbs and fry carbs. Maybe starch will still turn out to be OK.  Also: it doesn't look as if the researchers distinguished between different types of sugars. Maybe some sugars will turn out to be safer than others. 
-	-	I'm not even vegetarian and I gotta correct you. You need to stop shopping at 7-11, large grocery stores have some very interesting things called "beans" in a wide selection of strains. *Entire societies* largely survive on those for their dietary protein.
-	-	It sounds like you're talking about time rather than work per se.  Cooking beans takes a long time, but it doesn't take a lot of work.  I soak dry beans overnight, then cook them while I'm doing something else (usually paying bills or some other little project I can do in the kitchen).  That way I'm not leaving the stove unattended.  I check on them when I happen to think of it.  In terms of actual work, probably no more than your pork chop example, but more time.
-	-	Quinoa FTW!
-	-	&gt;All my local grocery stores sell nothing but soy-based meat substitutes  What? they don't sell any lentils, chickpeas, quinoa, barley, nuts, seeds etc? 
-	-	&gt; but you're going to find it impossible to get enough protein on a vegan diet if you do manual labor.   Tell that to [Carl Lewis](http://www.earthsave.org/lifestyle/carllewis.htm).
-	-	So... I run marathons and I'm vegan. 
-	-	He specifically asked about a respected rebuttal.  A link to some random blog by a person with no qualifications does not meet the "respected" portion of the request.  Pointing that out is not an ad hominem.
1	4	Opposite.  I love cooking.  I just happen to have a job, 2 rambunctious toddlers, a wife who works crazy long hours, and hobbies *other than* cooking.
-	-	I see what you're trying to say, but that type of analogy reflects the problem with a lot of current thinking which basically demonizes carbohydrate intake. There's no evidence for wholegrains being a problem, and a lot of positive evidence in their favour. It's just a lazy fad a few people are making money off. 
-	-	I downvoted you for this in case you're wondering  &gt;I gave it up because it was right  Arrogance of this level disgusts me. Because "I thought it was right" or "because it was the right thing for me" fine statements. "Not eating meat is **right**" is ridiculous.
0	2	Downvoted for complaining about 2 downvotes.
-	-	&gt; Proteins are tricky because they need a Voltron-like combination of a "complete" protein to actually work.  Meh, that's overstating the case a lot.  Remember that the body stores the essential amino acids.  The real question is over what time period do you need to ensure completeness?   It's around about 7 days; as that's roughly how large the bodies stores of the essentials amino acids are.  So as long as you don't eat the same thing every day, you're fine.  A lot of the ideas about how difficult it must be to be vegetarian are based on comparison with the protein levels in meat, and assuming that this is the required level (which is false, most people eat far more protein than needed).  And also ignores that we're built as survivors through starvation periods - there's a lot of machinery in the body to mitigate short term nutritional defincies - so a few days between beans is not going to hurt.  
0	1	&gt; Proteins are tricky because they need a Voltron-like combination of a "complete" protein to actually work.  Hint: It's uninformed crap like this that's getting you downvoted (I mean, aside from your apparently complete ignorance of quick-to-prepare vegetarian foods like canned beans).  Protein combining is an outdated, incorrect notion.
-	-	...now that's something to ponder. Can you build and launch an interstellar spacecraft without animal products?
0	1	...and my AXE!
-	-	Not so good. I try to get 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight into my system everyday. There is hardly any protein in most vegetables.
-	-	And here's another study showing whole-grain carbohydrates offering protection against colorectal cancer:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17490973?dopt=Citation
-	-	The study I linked in my original comment does show a protective effect from whole grains. It's the same one this article cites.   Regarding studies of whole grains vs none at all, from the article:  " A recent meta-analysis of seven major studies showed that cardiovascular disease (heart attack, stroke, or the need for a procedure to bypass or open a clogged artery) was 21 percent less likely in people who ate 2.5 or more servings of whole-grain foods a day compared with those who ate less than 2"  This also suggests the benefit of wholegrains on cardiovascular health.   For further reading I suggest you see the work of Dr Tom Hamilton.   http://drtomhalton.blogspot.com/
-	-	Solution? Eat meat, vegetables, and fruits. Avoid grains, or eat in small amounts.  Like omnivores 11,000 years ago.
0	1	Yeah, sorry. I'm a bad person. I'd rather kill a living thing than sacrifice my humanity. Yes, eating meat is human. Yes, it's natural, healthy, and perfectly fine. I take issue with CAFO, and the strong environmental issues, but I'm not going to drink 200 grams a day worth of pea protein powder. Down vote away for having an opinion other than yours. I understand, I did the same thing when I was a vegetarian for ten years. I also saw the health effects first hand on myself and fellow vegetarian friends. Ya'll are deluding yourselves if you think a well planned vegetarian diet is any healthier than a well planned omnivorous diet. 
0	2	it's called natural health, and you can't patent it fool.  I will be a millionaire.  just you wait.  
-	-	in my experience, few vegetarians become vegetarians for health reasons. if it's for health reasons you just cut down on red meat and allow yourself that chicken caesar every now and then or something. you dont become "vegetarian"  for the most part it's done out of principle, and just making the best of it with the vegetarian options.  i think this notion of vegetarian zealot downvote brigades is completely contrived. it's just a loudmouth here and there.
-	-	So use Bragg's Liquid Soy Seasoning instead. No Sodium problem.  edit: Bragg's, not Brigg's.
-	-	Does high protein and moderate fat correlate with improved levels of β-hydroxybutyrate? I'm trying to do a low-carb diet to improve my depression and from what I understand, [β-hydroxybutyrate is a precursor of BHB](http://www.moodfoods.com/dieting/fasting.pdf) (an isomer of GHB).
-	-	If you look at the voting in this thread, you'll see it's quite the opposite. Vegetarians downvote anything, including science, that clashes with their beliefs. 
-	-	That's my point.  THere are plenty of cuts of meat where, to prepare the main course of your meal, this is the process:  1) Apply fire.  That's it.  That's the whole preparation. No rinsing marinading, dicing, spicing, sauteeing, tossing, etc.  You literally take it out of the paper, burn it gently, and then you have something of high enough quality you could even serve it to guests.  I'm a vegetarian for a variety of reasons, but ease-of-preparation sure as hell isn't one of them.
1	7	Luckily there's rice and pea protein powder that makes it easy to get plenty of protein..
1	4	LOL.
-	-	Yes, but for the purposes of suppressing metabolic syndrome, a low GI diet is good whether it be full of carbs or not. It's the bouncing around of your blood sugar that is harmful to your body.
-	-	Wasn't implying that but low gl carbs are likely better for you. Also think about fiber content - "net carbohydrates"
-	-	I cooked a steak last night for 8 minutes and fed 10 people quite well.  I don't see how anyone could argue your point that meat is ridiculously easier to cook.    I also don't understand how people can be so dismissive of phytoestrogens.  If hormones are so disquieting in beef why is it that 1 million times the amount of hormone in a soy bean isn't?  
-	-	The same way table salt is made from chlorine gas. 
-	-	The China Study is sketchy in both it's motivation and method.
0	1	Which doesn't mean a fucking thing. Ridiculous ad hominems like you've just presented don't actually address the arguments she put forward. It's a classic logical fallacy to attack the person and their credentials and not the substance of the argument itself. 
-	-	Actually she did analysis the raw data.  I suggest you actually read her rebuttal instead of making assumptions.  
-	-	Even herbivores? Seems unnecessary.
-	-	But understand that's not whole grains vs. no grains, that's whole grains vs. not whole grains.  Not whole grains in this case most likely means refined grains.  For an analogy, let's say that 95% of the population smoked cigarettes and that unfiltered cigarettes were the norm.  In this world, smoking a 5 or more filtered cigarettes a day would be correlated with lower cancer risk.  This would not necessarily make smoking filtered cigarettes the healthiest way to live your life.  (I'm not saying this is the case with whole grains, just that it is entirely possible for an action that isn't entirely optimal to be associated with health benefits in certain kinds of studies)

I therefore question it's veracity.   http://www.jacn.org/content/20/1/50.short  All this study does is look at weight loss and dietary compliance.   http://cerealchemistry.aaccnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/CCHEM-87-2-0167?journalCode=cchem  This one requires a log-in. But it intro seems to argue in favour of the benefits of wholegrains "Nevertheless, it is difficult to argue against the evidence, particularly for the benefit of whole grains in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases."    
-	-	&gt;It is in fact a widely considered as the definitive rebuttal to Campbell by a large number of 'respected' people.  Like who?  &gt;if I reproduce the rebuttal is the argument then legitimate?  If it then becomes respected instead of an assumed joke, sure.
-	-	I covered those, just not in name.  &gt; I mean, you can DIY a lot of awesome protein-rich vegetarian foods, but sometimes there just isn't the time, y'know  Beans require soaking, rinsing, etc. depending on the type, and even afterwards you don't exactly have a ready-to-eat main course.  Compare vs. a chicken breast (or vegetarian counterpart) that you can just throw into an electric grill and forget about until it's ready.
-	-	What about a high protein, high carbohydrate diet?
-	-	&gt;Which is pretty much true outside of vegan/veg circles  No, it isn't "pretty much true" at all.  I just did an informal poll, and asked the 5 nutritional biochemists who are here today if they think the china study is "horse shit" or not.  5 out of 5 said no.  None of them are vegans, and our company does not produce vegan products.  So I think they fall outside of "vegan/veg circles".
-	-	fructose is pretty easily converted into glucose and sucrose by the body.
-	-	Dietary fiber is starch, and pretty essential, along with certain vitamins (primarily vitamin C) that don't come in meat. Our digestive system is better compared to that of boars and bears than dogs and cats, as we are omnivores, and they are carnivores.

1	4	what's so special about taking protein supplements at a construction site? if it's portability there are portable options too. if people will make fun of you or it's some other social thing... well, that's more of a personal preference than an "it's impossible" situation.

-	-	It ain't hard to find pre-cooked beans.   It sounds more like your issue is you don't like to cook and prefer prepackaged stuff, which is going to be *especially* hard if you're vegetarian and don't have the eating patterns the food industry caters to.
-	-	You know they invented this process called canning. They sell canned beans now, pre-soaked and rinsed. And it's also not very hard to sit down once a week, or every 10 days, and make a shitload of beans. Soaking them requires all of pouring water and beans into a pot and letting it sit. Rinsing requires all of washing them for about 1-2 minutes the next day. Cook em up with some of your favorite veggies and spices and put them in the fridge, healthier and cheaper than meat. A lot cheaper, especially if you buy in bulk. Dried beans also don't go bad very easily when stored properly, and don't require any energy. You need to freeze meat or else it goes bad. Lots of things you seem to not want to look at. 
-	-	A good quality pressure cooker make a huge difference with cooking beans. You can whip up a batch from dry beans in about 30 minutes total.  Once the pressure cooker is up to temperature, it only takes about 20-22 minutes to cook the beans.  Just avoid the old fashion cheap pressure cookers with the wobbly pressure release tops.  They tend to explode if you heat them up too much.
0	2	I thought it was satire.  It is certainly funny whether or not it is intended to be.
0	1	haha, yeah, I noticed that too.  It could be a 20 year meta study that shakes the foundation of science and nutrition itself and these frothed mouthed zealots would call bullshit.  
-	-	Can we please stop this bigoted bullying against vegetarians? It's really embarrassing to keep reading unprovoked attacks by meat eaters.
-	-	Whole-grain is the key. 
-	-	&gt;Vegetarian cooking is a lot more work than making meat where you can just toss a pork chop into a pan.  thats your perception - you can use lentils instead of mince meat, nuts instead of cheese, barley or brown rice instead of pasta and you are gettin plant based proteins at no additional effort in standard recipes.   I am vegan and eat legumes, quinoa, barley, beans, seeds, nuts, greens, fruit, tubers etc and can honestly say that it takes no more effort to shop or prepare food than pre-vegan days. it takes about 1-2months to adapt, but then its life as usual. E.g. last night: couscous, marinated tofu, spinach &amp; avo - took about 5mins to prepare. todays lunch was leftover butternut, sweetpotato &amp; cashew soup. Tonights dinner is chickpeas, spinach, peppers, tomato &amp; quinoa - will take less than 10mins to prepare.   For some of my [favourite foodi blogs](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/hkrxo/possibly_why_were_getting_trolls_in_rvegan/c1xkzvi) 
-	-	Probably the fibre in there, not the sugars &amp; starches.
-	-	They also have anti-inflammatory properties and are associated with [lower risk of cardiovascular related mortality.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17556700)
-	-	A high carb diet  is the norm for most who would read this study, so the not-normal action is stated as the source of a change, rather than the normal one.
-	-	He mostly talks about them in reference to [AGEs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_glycation_end-product).
-	-	animals are made of plants. 
-	-	&gt;Problem with plant sourced protein is that the vegetarian-food industry has standardized on soy  No it hasn't.  &gt;which has its own problems thanks to its abundance of phytoestrogens.  [Debatable to say the least](http://jacknorrisrd.com/?p=1778)  &gt;Vegetarian cooking is a lot more work than making meat where you can just toss a pork chop into a pan.  Meat cooks faster than veggies? What kind of black magic are you working on your stove top? Also, open a can of beans? Grill some seitan and make a sandwich? Microwave some gardein or a burrito? Contrast this with meat where you can't just eat meat all day every day and will have to cook _some_ veggies. 
1	4	&gt;  This is important because high fat increases cancer risk (56) and plant protein seems to decrease whereas animal protein increases cancer mortality (57). Interestingly, colonic cancer-inducing damage caused by red meats may be avoided with high amylose, low CHO diets (58). These studies suggest that macronutrient sources and combinations are very important and that testing them through highly controlled studies, such as those achieved with mice, represents a powerful approach to this question.  Correct me if I'm wrong but this study cites another that states a low carb, high **plant** sourced protein diet is better than animal protein diets  http://www.annals.org/content/153/5/289.abstract?ijkey=b1f9fa9450c63ed84fc9c79ad8b83d41be745fd7&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha
-	-	I think Gary Taubes suggested in his book that carbohydrates might be the source of cancer as well as heart disease. This seems to strengthen the hypothesis that a high intake of carbohydrates have been the largest nutritional source of our life style diseases. There was also a study showing that cancer cells use fructose to proliferate. That was in vitro though.  EDIT: I just realized that Taubes obviously didn't suggest it was *the* source of cancer, as there are many sources/causes of cancer. But I meant that I remember him talking about carbohydrates as a factor, although I don't remember the details.
1	4	I "knew" that for a long time. Starting to avoid carbs some 12 years ago was so far (I'm 40) the best single decision of my life. The benefits are so many I wouldn't even know where to start.  A propos current topic, there's been research done (in the '80s I believe) showing that cancer cells in vitro thrive and grow like mad when fed with sugars but stop multiplying and start dying without it, like when fed with fats and proteins. I can't find the study online though.  Maybe someone here knows more about it?   
-	-	I'm not sure what the standards are for respected (published in a scientific journal?) Harriet A. Hall is a fairly well known skeptic and doctor who had a few issues with it: http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/385/ Now I know that's just one person and not a whole study for rebuttal.   My biggest problem with the China Study isn't it's findings, I don't eat a whole lot of meat, but the fact that of all the people involved only one guy and his son took the results of the study and made it into a book. Many of the other people involved in the study didn't feel comfortable drawing the same conclusions that the author did based on the data they had collected.  This is completely anecdotal and full of confirmation bias on my part, but the biggest reason I was so skeptical of it from the get go was that all the people telling me about it, swearing by it, and urging me to read it were the same people I knew who were into new age medicine, crystal healing, and all manner of other woo. I did not finish the book, but it is definitely written to appeal to that crowd.
1	6	Why does a vegetarian diet have to be low protein?
-	-	ALL natural fat is good for you. Eating a diet of high protein/vegetables/fruits is what humans are meant for (and what our ancestors ate for ages before agriculture/farming was invented). We have not evolved out of this phase so far and probably wont for another million + years (if ever). 
-	-	Why would they? Some of the healthiest fats (think peanuts, olives, avocado) come from vegetables.
-		To a person that trains for a marathon, taking protein supplements isn't a big deal. Try doing it at the construction site. 
-	-	Have you noticed it's always low-fat (as if that's a good thing), and "diet" for low or no-carbs? They never say "low-carbs." I swear it's a conspiracy to keep up this fat is bad charade so people will keep eating their cheap to produce corn snacks. 
1	4	Loudmouths stand out more than voices of reason.  Don't get me wrong though, I detest the "froth-mouthed zealots" on the other end of the spectrum.  Just head over to /r/fitness and see the "hive mind" mentality of 'OMGZ, if I eat one carb I'll get the diabetes!' as well as the 'Yeah, you gotta eat over 9000 grams of carbs every day or you can't get strong' type.  Some people just like to stick their fingers in their ears and do the internet version of singing la la la. 
-	-	And how exactly do you know who is downvoting which post? I didn't notice a red font on your name. Are you a reddit administrator?
-	-	&gt;Eating whole **instead of refined grains** substantially lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad) cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin levels   So, maybe it's the replacement of refined grains, not necessarily the whole grains themselves. This is a flaw I've found in many studies - they replace refined grains with whole grains, find a benefit, then recommend people eat more whole grains. How about studying high whole grain intake vs none at all?   &gt;The data on cancer are mixed, with some studies showing a protective effect and others showing none   You can't conclude that it decreases cancer risk with "mixed" results.   &gt;An intriguing report from the Iowa Women's Health Study linked whole-grain consumption with fewer deaths **from noncardiac, noncancer causes**   Cancer and cardiovascular disease are the two most common causes of death. If whole grain intake can't even slightly decrease the risk of these, I find the idea that they are so beneficial to be highly suspect.   Seems to me like whole-grain intake is associated with a healthier lifestyle in general. That's why they find that people who eat more are healthier. Someone eating bran flakes for breakfast every morning isn't usually likely to eat fast food for lunch every day, for example.
0	2	Basically everything is bad for you if you have enough of it and everything is good for you if you have it in small enough quantities. These whole extreme diets jumping from "carbs are brilliant eat tons of them" to "carbs are the devil, don't even look at them" is just stupid. You can tell how little science goes behind a lot of these diets because of the fact that they come and go in fashion; never heard of gravity going out of fashion. Why not eat a balanced diet and your body will tell you if it doesn't like something.
-	-	Southern Ontario.  It's all soy protein here, either in tofu form or TVP form.  No seitan, no qorn, no BOCA in any of the major grocery chains.
-	-	It's not vegan, as it requires egg white as a binder.  Combine that with the fact that it's a mycoprotein grown in vats in a lab, and it's not really the best substitute, as if you're a vegetarian who's OK with eating eggs, you might as well eat eggs, and if you're a vegan, this product isn't suitable.
0	2	Dogs don't have molars, and are not known for chewing their food, which is necessary to digest carbohydrates.  So, of course, they don't do well with carbohydrates.  Your comparison is totally invalid, I'm afraid.
0	5	uh what are you trying to say.      Clearly vegans are the cause of America's obesity and laziness.  
-	-	These two aren't mutually exclusive when it comes to cancer prevention. There is no such thing as a single valid diet.
0	1	Hybrid cars are fuking bullshit!  They slow, but don't stop, energy usage!  Her's a fucking idea, stop using energy entirely, and have are cars fly through the air completely for free!  Everything else is stupid!  Anyway, not eating meat doesn't lower the chance of cancer rates, bone disease is a negligible cause of death in western countries amongst the elderly, especially when we're talking about cancers (leukemia is a young-people disease), and your assertion that milk consumption leads to weaker bones is the exact opposite of what the data shows.  Osteoporosis may have some correlation with meat consumption (though it has only been demonstrated with isolated protein, and there is some evidence to suggest otherwise with whole meat), but the countries with the highest rates of osteoporosis also have the highest life expectancies overall.  Anyway, if you want to troll, try [/r/keto](/r/keto) you'll probably find them to be better targets overall for these rants of yours.
0	1	&gt;fuking bullshit. the reason the person got cancer in the first place is due to bad diet. a high protein diet slows(but doesn't stop it now does it?) see how fuking insane this title is. slow, but dont stop the tumor growth. here's a fuking idea, how about we stop and cure the tumor.  the "person" is one of several mice. and they all got their tumours the same way.  it helps to read the  first paragraph of the abstract before attempting to "debunk" a scientific study.
-	-	Indirectly linked still leaves you with the same conclusion.
-	-	If fat was linked to fat, how was the original fat created?
0	2	Yes, and outside of the militant vegan/veg circles it's widely considered to be a load of disingenuous horse shit.
-	-	Vegetables don't actually contain that much carbs in general, and there's plenty of protein there.  This study specifically used plant proteins and avoided animal proteins because those cause cancer.
-	-	&gt;Cancer or French Fries?  Tough decision but I think I'd go with the fries
-	-	[The Protein Debate](http://www.dsolve.com/additional-resources/downloads/doc_download/17-the-protein-debate), a short point-counter point between the author of the China Study and a proponent of eating like our cavemen ancestors.  For what it's worth, I find the China Study more persuasive.
1	4	Very interesting study, and against the current high protein fad. 
-	-	This tested against a Western diet.  A Western diet is very far away than a vegetarian low protein diet.  That could have been even better, but we don't know because it wasn't tested.  I don't think anyone thinks the Western diet is healthy.
-	-	Since the topic is a low carb diet, most beans are out.
-	-	Well, i eat mostly a vegetarian diet but vegetarian diets can be pretty high in protein.  It sounds like the best course of action is reduce carbs increase protein... doesn't necessarily mean we should all rush out and buy bacon..
-	-	There's a difference between joggingfor cardiovascular health and being a competitive bodybuilder. The first shouldn't need (much) more protein than normal, the second needs obscene amounts.
1	4	Personally, I have no idea, but you could probably get an answer if you posted a topic in r/Fitness, r/AdvancedFitness, or r/AskScience. I'd be interested in the answer, too.
1	4	&gt;The max protein/meal is still under debate.  After a little googling, I can see that.
1	7	Thanks for that. It would be tempting to say, "Well, then, my recommendation stands!" but that would be uncalled for and unkind, wouldn't it?
-	-	You are going to be absolutely *thrilled* when someone shows you this newfangled contraption called a "freezer". 
0	2	The study used plant-based proteins and found that animal proteins increased cancer, so you've got nothing to worry about. Post title is potentially misleading. 
-	-	Many boca burgers ARE mostly soy, except for their veggie patties, which don't have much protein.  If you're trying to find soy protein alternatives, check out rice/pea protein powders. Trueprotein.com offers a pretty solid deal.
-	-	I would also like to point people's attention to the article below about cancer and protein: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/07/AR2006120700845.html
0	1	shut your mouth,  you dont know jack shit about natural healing.  asshole.  
-	-	By clarifying my position i was trying to add the caveat that it's Campbells interpretation of the china study that is widely considered to be a load of disingenuous horse-shit. Which is pretty much true outside of vegan/veg circles and it certainly isn't a clear cut one sided argument in favor of Campbell in the scientific community.  But either way this is getting nowhere. Let's just agree to disagree, getting worked up and arguing with strangers on the internet is always a ridiculous waste of time. We both think the other person is completely wrong and a nut-job so lets cut our losses and get on with our lives.
-	-	&gt; Nuts instead of cheese.  Get out. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; 
0	2	It is in fact a widely considered as the definitive rebuttal to Campbell by a large number of 'respected' people. Yes it is ad hominem to disregard the substance of an argument on the basis that someone isn't qualified enough. I've got a degree in biochemistry, I'm 3 years into a molecular biology focused phd, if I reproduce the rebuttal is the argument then legitimate? How qualified does someone have to be for the argument to be accepted, does someone have to published in order to be able to produce an intelligent argument? Can someones argument only be right if they are judged qualified and respected enough by you?

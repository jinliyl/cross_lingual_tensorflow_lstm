-	-	I drive a Ford Fiesta. I get well over 30MPG combined, not highway like all those misleading car ads. Since I drive 35 miles per day it makes sense to have a good small car. Now my wife drives 1 mile per day and has a Ford Edge. We use this vehicle when we go out as a family. I purchased the Fiesta because gas got up $4 per gallon this year and I felt like I couldn't justify spending $200 per month on gas to get work in my cross over vehicle. I think people who drive more than 10 miles per day, need to give up their pick up trucks and or cross overs and get a car that really gets good mileage like a Prius, Fiesta, Fit or some other small car. 
0	1	In the article is says the US get's 9.8 million barrels a day domestically but uses 19 million a day, which is why we are in the mess we are now with the middle east.  Realistically, what would a day in a life be here in the US on 9.8 million barrels of oil a day?  Assume that we would have to cut it immediately for this scenario (so no answers of us building 5000 wind farms or solar panels covering Arizona).

Do like the Chinese 20 years ago...prohibit heating of buildings below the Mason Dixon line.  Mandate a wood stove in every home.  Electric cars and cars that get more than 35 miles per gallon are only allowed on roadways,   long distance freight is to travel bty rail whenever possible.   Cut in half the number of airline flights..Make the airlines fly larger planes .  Get the military out of the conflicts that we are embroiled in. Reduce the size of the military.  Make kids walk up to a mile to get to school.
1	7	Convert all long-haul trucking to rail. That would reduce fuel consumption for freight from 59 miles per ton per gallon to 436 miles per ton per gallon. That's an 85% reduction. Then, all trucking becomes short-haul, where trucks excel. That alone would probably reduce our usage by 2 million bpd.  Then, convert all long-haul passenger travel to trains, providing good rail links between all cities and within cities. That reduces by probably another 1 million bpd.  That alone is a third of your proposed reductions. Of course, rail is pass√©, so good luck with that.
-	-	Upvote for the Fiesta.
-	-	Get a TDI! or some other small diesel. I get over 45 miles to the gallon combined city and highway in my 98 Jetta TDI. And, that's a car from 1998. My brother's passat from 1996 got a record of 57 miles to the gallon after a few modifications.

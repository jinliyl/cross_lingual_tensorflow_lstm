-	-	well, there's a quote, attributed (apocryphally?) to winston churchill, which states   &gt;"i don't need to eat the whole pot to know what the soup tastes like."  you were brave to read so much ... or just very, very bored.  :-)
0	2	They are disjoint sets, science investigates the physical while religion investigates the metaphysical. Certain theologies try to cross that line and certain sciences try to cross that line , but that is the fallacy of the individuals responsible.  
-	-	Regardless if everything he said was wrong, your approach is embarrassing to people who know he is wrong. Don't ruin my ability to explain truth to people before I even have a chance to talk to them.
0	2	That's a good quote; very applicable. I didn't need to read all of his points to know that they were mostly garbage.      I wasn't bored or brave, I just have a strong commitment to give honest consideration to views that I don't agree with. It takes a large quantity of will power, but it needs to be done. Otherwise, I don't *know* that I'm right; and naturally I am always right ;).
-	-	1) I feel your frustration, but you're not helping.   2) Science and religion are not mutually exclusive, even though science and creationism are.
0	2	About halfway thorough I couldn't take it, so I hurried through it. My eyes crossed over every word, yes. I am all about researching both sides, but there's just some arguments so self-evidently ignorant that they aren't worth consideration. 
-	-	&gt;Science and religion are not mutually exclusive  Maybe a person can have religion and still believe in science, but it requires some mental gymnastics...
0	1	I didn't say that they were mutually exclusive. I said that the only way you can accept both religion and science is if you believe in theistic evolution.   Frustration? I'm not frustrated, I'm just pointing out how everything he said is completely wrong. 
-	-	&gt;They are disjoint sets, science investigates the physical while religion investigates the metaphysical.  Not true at all. Many religious claims are clearly physical. I would even argue that very few religious claims could be considered to be under metaphysics.  &gt;Certain theologies try to cross that line  All of them do.
1	6	What sciences try to cross that line?
0	2	guess that means michael behe can go suck it.
-	-	tldr; A billion years is a long time.
-	-	So is Lamb saying that the eye vertibrates have evolved after the hagfish 'split off'? If that is what he is saying, that is not a solid conclusion.  To me, regression makes more sense. That is the hagfish at one time had the same eye that the other eel and vertibrates have and lost it.
1	4	Clear vision. Nice.
-	-	Kitzmiller vs Dover put the nail in the coffin of intelligent design long ago. Hell common skeptical inquiry and research quickly reveals the many flaws with intelligent design.
0	1	They still cannot clear a fucking eye floaters!
1	4	I liked it though the terminology used to describe the eye is pretty unfamiliar to me.
-	-	My thoughts exactly. I planned on reading the whole thing until I scrolled down and noticed it was 5+ pages
-	-	In evolutionary theory: All you need a single photon receptor, and all the rest of the eye will develop from it.  In fact it will also develop the brain.  You're not looking at a complex eye being formed all at once.  You're more looking to how a photon receptor could be made.  I do know God is real, Jesus is LORD. Evolutionism and Creationism are not mutually exclusive: http://www.goodnewsjim.com/FSS/articles/jim-longday.html  
0	1	Did you even read 'Darwin's black box'? It was remarkable!*      *remarkably ignorant; I could barely force myself to read it.  
-	-	He's had an invitation for quite a while.
0	1	Everything you've written is absolute bullshit. A global flood is not corroborated by any evidence, there's overwhelming evidence that man has existed for more than 6000 years, and there's nothing in the slighest to suggest that man was created in his current form, everything points to common descent for every living thing on Earth. You can't just pick and choose what scientific evidence you want to follow based on ideas that you want to arbitrarily pick and choose from your religion.   The only way science and religion can exist is if you believe in some kind of theistic evolution. 
-	-	FTA  &gt;The hagfish eye must therefore have degenerated from that more advanced form.
0	2	&gt;I know God exists for a fact. I know Jesus is Lord.      You have to understand: every other religious group *knows* they are right too.    You have to ask yourself **"How do *I* know"**    For three months, take away the existence of God as an axiom. Assume God doesn't exist, and then give an honest look at the evidence. On the one hand, doing this will strengthen your faith and solidify your arguments for believe it. On the other hand, you may discover that you were wrong; but in that case you would be better for knowing.        Also, picking out the hardest part of a theory and noting that is hasn't been proven is not an argument against it. It is quite possible that we will create a photon receptor in a lab setting some time in the future. It's kinda like saying "the Earth isn't round, no one has seen all of it!" Well, eventually we got to the moon.
0	1	&gt; The world needs Christianity. Everyone needs Christianity  Why?
1	7	Oh, for the love of Science!

0	2	did you finish it?
-	-	yeah, back to 5 hours of call of duty though, right?
-	-	~~Astrology~~ [Cosmology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#Metaphysical_cosmology), for example.      ~~Before you cry out "THAT'S NOT A SCIENCE", realize that I understand that.~~   **The point is that theologies which make physical claims are equally perverting their field.**    "Sciences" that make metaphysical claims are as misinformed as "theologies" that make physical claims. In truth, neither should be called "science" or "religion" respectively.      edit: Correction and clarification. 
-	-	You're being too stringent. Open your mind.      Individual religions make physical claims, but the concept of religion itself is to understand that which is not experienced physically. The fact that people pervert this concept is a modern fallacy in the history of religion, and is the fault of everyone who commits it; *Just as it is the fault of scientists that try to make metaphysical claims and not science itself.*      I am not arguing that people should have religion, only the notion that you can't have both.      &gt;All of them do        No, they don't.
0	2	You claimed that science made metaphysical claims and gave the example of astrology. That deserves condescension and derision. Also, the example of cosmology is not a good one, the wikipedia entry itself makes a distinction between the two. Physical cosmology is science, metaphysical cosmology is not. 
0	1	Don't condescend me because you don't agree with what I am saying.      Upon further examination, astrology was a bad example. Cosmology would be a better example. [Some cosmologists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#Metaphysical_cosmology) certainly try to make metaphysical claims; that's not bullshit, and it is not my fault that you didn't take a moment to consider my points.
0	2	You've still failed to give an example of a science that makes metaphysical claims. It's also become evident that you're a bullshit spewing whackjob.

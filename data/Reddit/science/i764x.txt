1	4	Does NASA do live web chats often? This seems really cool. I'll be there.
1	6	Does it create anti-matter as recently shown on your website?
0	1	Holy Crap!
1	4	Awesome!  I love [lightning](http://nickulivieriphotography.zenfolio.com/p37130860).  Especially photographing it, as you can see in the link.  I hope I can tune it.
-	-	They do, sometimes more than others. Here's a page that lists the upcoming ones: http://www.nasa.gov/connect/chat/ Some aren't listed yet, but I know of these that will be done:  July 3: Help NASA Measure an Asteroid.  Aug. 12-13: Watch the Perseid Meteor Shower -- an "up all night" chat)  Oct. 8: Draconids Fireball Outburst  Nov. 18-19: Watch the Leonids Meteor Shower -- an "up all night" chat)  Then in December, there will be chats for the Geminids meteor shower and POSSIBLY the total lunar eclipse. Details still being worked on those -- and of course, these are just Marshall-led chats. There will be many others led by various NASA Centers.
-	-	I'm going to have to leave that question to Richard or Monte, the live chat experts. :)

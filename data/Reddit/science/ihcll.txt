-	-	&gt; I stated very clearly that a virus isn't the issue, not that fatigue isn't an issue.  You're not very consistent:  &gt; If you are "chronically fatigued", how about getting off your lazy fat ass and doing some exercise?  You whine about chronic fatigue sufferers and then try to make it sound as though your concerns are more specific by referring to a virus. There is no conclusive evidence linking chronic fatigue with a specific virus, making it a red herring.  Some active people suffer from chronic fatigue and exercise with an appropriate diet doesn't help. We don't know the cause; it might be a virus and it might not, but regardless, your sage advice doesn't help them.
-	-	&gt; Yes, I will state that **nearly all** cases where someone is tired all the time  By your own quote you admit that chronic fatigue syndrome is a possibility.  We aren't talking about "nearly all", we are talking about the *other* people.
1	8	How would you know that any ideas and advice doesn't help?  Now you are grasping at straws trying to find flaws. I would very much like to know how the people who suffer from fatigue live. Quite likely it is small changes, but several, and they will see marked improvements in their lives.   And yes, you can actually be fat without being huge and bulky, and yes, you can still be fat while having reasonably good fitness. and yes, you can still be fat while eating fairly healthy.  So again. Getting up off your ass and working out, and adjusting your diet will help in most (if not all) cases.  It's not rocket science. Combine it with several of the suggestions I have mentioned and I can all but guarantee you'll feel much better, and less tired.  oh, how about offering something constructive, instead of harping at what I have to say?  At least I attempt to offer, if not help, something, anything for the people who feel tired.
0	2	&gt; How would you know that any ideas and advice doesn't help?  This is bizarre. I already said I was referring specifically to people who have tried or continue regular exercise and healthy, personalised diets but for whom it has little benefit.  It's not that hard to understand.  &gt; oh, how about offering something constructive, instead of harping at what I have to say? At least I attempt to offer, if not help, something, anything for the people who feel tired.  I doubt you're helping as much as you seem to think you are.
-	-	Oh, I do reply. However, I wouldn't consider myself medieval per se, although I could perhaps be considered "old fashioned" by not taking "quick fix explanations" at face value.  
-	-	That is partly what I am trying to say, it's not an illness but symptoms.  These symptoms, however, does not equal "it's a virus". Particularly since no such virus has ever been detected... and not because of lack of effort. 
-	-	&gt; Sometimes I am seriously puzzled over the lack of very basic understanding of your own body and its functions.  Ironic.  Your problem is that you made a sweeping generalisation. Someone's always tired? Oh, they must be fat or inactive. The body (especially the brain) is just a little bit more complicated than that. Every generation bring with it tens of genetic mutations, making individuals radically different. Science has recognised that chronic fatigue is a very real and debilitating condition. It's not as if it just appeared overnight; what has happened it that humans have advanced out of the dark ages and recognised that not everyone is the same.  Yes, the modern lifestyle is conducive to myriad medical conditions, but just because all X are Y doesn't mean all Y are X.  tl;dr: 'Old-fashioned' is a euphemism for 'backwards'.
1	4	Very good bash, almost eloquent, but it's a swing and a miss. I stated very clearly that a virus isn't the issue, not that fatigue isn't an issue.  Yes, I will state that nearly all cases where someone is tired all the time, is fat and inactive. You see, it's a circle. The more tired you are the less active you become and/or vice versa. The point remains the same though. Get off your ass and be active (correctly active I should add), identify the right food to consume (takes some doing but is very possible) for YOU.  I bet a few yoga sessions for anyone who thinks they suffer from "a fatigue virus" making them tired would do wonders for their energy levels. So would some fresh countryside air.  Throw out your old bed linens/pillows. Remove the mold found in almost every home these days (diluted bleach woks best but wear protection).  There are so many things compounded that causes you to be tired and it isn't "a fatigue virus".
-	-	Can you really blame them after HIV/AIDS?  Not to say anything about people currently suffering from it, but after Factor VIII and issues with people having acquired HIV from transfusions, I don't think you can fault them for being overly cautious.
0	2	This article should should have checked the more recent research findings. XMRV **doesn't** cause chronic fatigue syndrome. How can we know for sure? It *didn't exist* before the ~~21st century, probably only about 5 years ago~~ [Edit: sorry, 1990s].  Where it came from:  * XMRV is a retrovirus. This is a family that includes HIV and likes to incorporate itself into the host genome. Many of these (not HIV) can get into the germline and be passed through generations.   * In animals (including humans) a large proportion of the genome (say ~8%) is actually 'fossilised' virus from past infections. In some animals the viruses can come back to 'life' (doesn't happen in humans, does in mice). These are called endogenous retroviruses.   * The "X" stands for xenotrophic. This means that while it is a mouse virus (M = murine = mouse) it doesn't replicate in mouse cells, only humans. We could tell it was very similar to a group of mouse viruses but not where it came from. This is very strange.  * A recent [paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6038/97.full) showed that the genome of XMRV perfectly matches two mouse endogenous retroviruses that have been recombined to create a new virus. It appeared when human prostate cancer cells were repeatedly "passaged" through laboratory mice for research purposes. This is also where it gained its affinity for human cells. *XMRV is an artefact that was accidentally produced in a lab*.   * The studies that claimed to show XMRV in the blood of CFS patients probably picked up traces of XMRV in the lab. It doesn't exist in the wild. More recent studies ([link1](http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/JVI.00693-11v1), [link2](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6038/94.short)) have failed to show XMRV in the blood of humans.  * There have now been calls for the 2009 paper to be retracted.

1	4	Fine, be that way. I wasn't really feeling up to it anyway.
-	-	There are some studies that say a virus is a possible cause so until we know for sure it might be a smart move.  You should play safe when it comes to possibly transmitting disease.
-	-	&gt; But does a virus really cause the disease?  But do you want to find out the hard way?
0	2	If you're easily exhausted, you should not be giving blood. Period.  Unless you have a deathwish.
0	1	Sounds like the ARC we all know and love.  I mean, banning all men who have had sex with men from giving blood?  Yeah, that's pretty fucked up too.
0	3	They banned me from giving blood for possibly having hep C. Scared the shit out of me, so imagine my relief when I tested just fine twice by the clinic and my doctor. I'm not mad at TRC, but I really wanted to hit the gallon mark before having to stop.  In my opinion, better safe than sorry. To all those that donate, thanks for what you do, I really wish I could keep helping. :( To those that don't, consider it if you can, but I'm not judging you if you don't!
0	1	Full disclosure: I am a fat-ass but I am building up my stamina and strength through exercise and a more active life. I'm tired most of the time and my body aches all the damn time, but it sure as hell isn't "a virus" or "chronic fatigue syndrome". It is attributed to years of being a lazy fat ass with atrophying muscles and shocking my body into movement.  If you are "chronically fatigued", how about getting off your lazy fat ass and doing some exercise? How about putting down that corn syrup laden ready meal and corn syrup full fizzy drink? How about eating a balanced diet of carbs, protein, fat etc? How about leading a balanced life sans all the "OMG THIS IS GOOD FOR YOU. IT'S A MIRACLE!" crap spewed out left and right?  If you have never used your body before in an active manner, guess what, you'll feel tired, have muscle aches and generally feel like shit. That is until you develop some basic muscle mass and build up basic endurance. It will take some time depending on what kind of fat ass you are.  Strangely enough people seems to think that the lifestyles they lead today is fine for a body developed over millions of years to suit a totally different lifestyle. Sometimes I am seriously puzzled over the lack of very basic understanding of your own body and its functions.  A bit on topic, the Red Cross has been bit in the ass before. Like it ever has been the red cross' fault for trying to help people.
1	6	XMRV causes autism!
-	-	I thought donated blood was tested for infectious diseases before being cleared for use.
1	4	Fascinating. Thank you for sharing. Do you do immunology research? 
-	-	No it isn't.  Giving blood isn't about the donor, it is about the recipient.  There is no way in hell that they should risk the safety and trust in the blood supply to get a couple of extra pints.
-	-	Let's do it the easy way: Human experimentation. Have some skeptics volunteer. 
-	-	No I'm just an interested medical student. I came across the story through [virology.ws](http://www.virology.ws) blog and podcasts as linked above, they followed the story closely. I would strongly recommend them for anyone with an interest in microbiology/infectious disease.
0	2	You seem to have failed to take into account the fact that a number of sufferers of CFS both eat healthily and exercise often.  We can agree on one point. People who choose to eat junk food and end up obese are not chronically fatigued. Excluding those with diagnosed medical conditions, these people are lazy and ignorant of their own health if they try and blame their laziness on the supposed CFS they suffer from.  However, you seem to be ignorant of something you possess not a single clue about. As someone who is active, the right weight, healthy, and pretty much chronically fatigued all the time, it irks me to see people disregard the fact that CFS is a genuine cataloged illness.  I'll answer your question with a question: Given I am chronically fatigued, how can I get off my "lazy" "fat" ass and do some exercise, when I do that already?    
-	-	This is how medieval people like FLT seem to steer conversations neurological or psychological conditions:  "Get off your fat ass and exercise." "I do." "Oh, okay... ;_;"  Don't expect a reply from him.
-	-	Now it is.  Not the case 30 years ago.
-	-	I did consider people who work out, are within a certain weight range etc. Being slim/appear fit (eg. within a weight range) and/or working out doesn't necessarily mean you are less of a fat ass. Shocking, I know. But look it up.  You are perhaps not eating right. Maybe you are allergic to some certain foods, additives (look for the "E" moniker in all packaged food) or other unexpected issues? Anemia causes fatigue, particularly in women. A lack of Vitamin "D" (rampant in certain parts of the world) makes you lethargic. Thyroid problems (notoriously hard to detect in near limit range individuals). Testosterone issues, in both men AND women are common during certain parts in life (eg. menopause in women, growing up during teen years, getting older etc).  Perhaps your exercise regiment is setup wrong, not allowing you full recovery between sessions, or you refuel incorrectly before and after work outs.  Talk to your local buff gym rat and he/she will perhaps open your eyes a bit.  There are a multitude of things that causes you to be tired, but extremely rarely is it something "unexplained", or anything that can't be "identified". You are just looking in the wrong direction and perhaps hoping there is an easy explanation and cause (eg. "OMG a virus).  Let me finally suggest you to change your mattress. Or better yet, try sleeping on the floor/other hard surface for a week and see if that makes you feel any better. It could be as simple as sleep apnea caused by snoring. Generally it gets worse sleeping on a soft surface. If you sleep next to someone (eg. married), make temporary arrangements to sleep in separate beds for a week (weird? maybe. does it work? most of the time).  Also, eliminate ALL light sources (alarm clock, night light, phone and even that annoying little led light from whatever electronic item you have in your bedroom). 
-	-	&gt; that CFS is a genuine cataloged illness.  In no way am I disagreeing with you, but CFS is not really an illness in the normal sense, it's more a constellation of symptoms. It's CFS if they can't figure out if anything else is wrong with you, not because they actually find anything specific that "roves" CFS. It is a diagnosis by excluding other possibilities, until all that is left is that constellation which doctors started calling CFS.

0	5	Sorry, the law specifically states that the mother has to prove that it wasn't aborted.  That's different than saying "miscarraige is illegal".  It may eventually pass that that is true, but even republicans aren't that stupid.  They aren't against miscarraiges, they are against abortions.    This just seems like a way to scare people, blackmail them, not accuse random women of abortion.  Abortions are illegal in the state, the nutcases already got that state. 
-	-	Isn't that backwards of how the law is supposed to work? Shouldn't the burden of proof fall on the state to prove that it was aborted?
-	-	The original comment was that miscarrying will make you liable to be investigated for homicide, because they are apparently *that* obsessed with the issue. Also, burden of proof that a crime was committed lies on the state. One should never have to prove that one didn't commit a crime.
1	8	I look at it like it is a womans body's way of being very picky and hopefully meaning a healthier baby...    
0	5	Yeah, but, if they miscarry in some US states now they are liable to be investigated for homicide. (sigh) Any of you other countries need citizens? I am ready to bail on the US now.
0	1	That's bullshit because a D&amp;C can cause permanent damage to uterine lining. 
1	8	Or they might go to jail for murder If they live in Mississippi apparently.
0	2	Having a child is an unbelievably selfish act and yet our culture bestows on them accolades as if it was noble and something to be proud of. Name 1 good reason to reproduce other than to have someone who will wipe your ass for free when you can't.
0	2	This isn't entirely true. There are some conditions like cervical incompetence and anti-phospholipid syndrome where women will continue to have miscarriages and have a much higher rate of miscarriage. These conditions can be treated but then woman's odds of getting pregnant are lower than average.
0	1	proof?  this sounds like bullshit.
0	1	&gt;if they miscarry in some US states now they are liable to be investigated for homicide.  unbe-fucking-lievable!  My mother had 8 miscarriages before I was finally born, fuck knows what they would do her!
-	-	Yea, hard to say the inclusion criteria of the cited study. One would assume that a routine workup for repeated miscarriage would have been carried out after the second and at worst the third failed pregnancy. It seems like this study is referring to those pts who have been ruled out for the normal culprits such as anatomical abnormality, coagulopathy, chromosomal abnormality, and hormonal imbalance. 
-	-	I thought this but didn't want to type it ;/  
0	1	Well it's like saying war is a selfish act.  Sure it is when you are attacking, but not defending.  Having a child in America is DEFENSE against the stupidity of the fundies.  That is a war that is raging. 
0	2	Someone has to fight off the haters.
0	1	Nothing because he's full of shit.
0	1	Well, continuation of the human race, that'd be nice, but I would assume that you're a [VHEMT](http://www.vhemt.org/) member and probably think the human race should die off, which is kinda silly.    
-	-	[Mormons](http://www.amplifyyourvoice.org/u/AFY_Will/2010/2/24/In-Utah-Miscarriage--Criminal-Homicide), what'aya gon'na do.
0	1	This guardian article talks about a few cases: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/24/america-pregnant-women-murder-charges  In most of them it seems like the women allegedly used drugs while pregnant, which may have caused the miscarriage. Doesn't make it any less fucked up though.
0	5	Sheesh, he's not suggesting that reproducing should stop entirely, he just says that it shouldn't be a huge thing that everyone in the entire world hopes to do.  If everyone has multiple babies, we're gonna die off more than likely faster than if we didn't reproduce at all.
-	-	I don't think the human race should die off, but I do think that not reproducing won't cause us to die off any time soon. Best to adopt.
0	1	Like I said...[bullshit](http://le.utah.gov/~2010/htmdoc/hbillhtm/HB0012.htm)
-	-	Sarcasm mode was on is all. You just can't tell because we can't see his face.

0	5	&gt;  her vision of Scientific American as a modern, fast, nimble and experimental media organization,   Too bad it's no longer a great magazine about science by scientists, like it used to be. It's been suffering from various sorts of exotic "vision" for more than a decade.   
-	-	What we really need is a social networking community for science fans and experts where people can collaborate, peer review, public review, and share news.  A place that is run by a respected educational organization.  (Reddit is cool and all, but really kind of the opposite of respected. :-)  Blogs are ok, but something like Facebook would do wonders for public science education.
0	1	I've heard the call for a "Facebook for Science" from all parts of the scientific spectrum (academia, government, media, etc.), but the problem is that all of the parts of that spectrum have different audiences without much functional overlap. Something like [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/) does some of the things you describe, but is of little use to non-scientists. Likewise, the direct benefits of interacting with the public is not obvious to the average researcher.   Until there's more common ground between the academic content business and the public content business, people will keep to their side of the aisle. Informaticians like Johan Bollen are working on some of the technical hurdles that have stymied such a merger in the past (check out [MESUR](http://www.mesur.org/MESUR.html), for example), but it's also not clear that the public is willing/able to participate at a level that would make such ventures meaningful. 
-	-	Like the internets? 
-	-	Perhaps like the original intention of the internet.  But not so much like it is these days.
1	4	Could you elaborate? I'm a science PhD student and rather enjoy the occasional SciAm buy, but I'd be eager to hear what has gone so amiss.
-	-	Until about the time of the first dot.com media bubble, articles in SciAm were very long and generally written by the research scientists themselves (and edited by SciAm staff.) About 10 years ago the magazine changed ownership (more than once iirc) and it fell into the hands of media studies grads who apparently had no understanding of its heritage. Since then it has devolved into a US version of New Scientist: you don't see long articles written by research scientists any more, instead you get synthesised guff written up from  university press releases, much the same as everywhere else.  I commend to you every issue of SciAm before about 10 years ago, right back until the 19th Century. The 1970s and 1980s were especially good. Most American libraries will have a complete set. Just grab a bunch and browse. 
1	4	It used to have more in-depth articles, and some great columns (Amateur Scientist, Connections).  Now it's watered-down and full of ridiculous ads.  Or at least it was a few years back when I canceled my sub. American Scientist (americanscientist.org) comes closest to what Sci Am used to be, imho.
-	-	Come now, fap jokes to science are just around the corner...

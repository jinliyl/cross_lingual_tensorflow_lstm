-	-	Why? Was the chicken in your microwave talking on a cellphone? And I don't think the sun is a cellphone either. (You can try talking on it, but it might burn your face a little)
-	-	You guys should totes get married
-	-	I got this one. Ionizing radiation are highly energetic particles or, as is usually the case, electromagnetic waves, that they can strip electrons from atoms and molecules, thus destroying bonds and creating free radicals that can incorrectly bond with other atoms/molecules in the area. This can be disastrous for organic compounds. Non-ionizing radiation has too little energy to do such things, so it bumps off particles harmlessly or, in the case of photons, either passes right through or get absorbed. 
-	-	The chicken in the microwave is exposed to hundreds of watts worth of microwave radiation, which makes anything come out a cell phone laughably tiny. The nastyness from the sun is caused by UV light, which is a whole different matter than anything coming out of a cell phone to start with as it's at a much shorter wavelength.
1	6	What is that even supposed to mean? Are you comparing the radiation from a microwave or the sun to a cell phone?
0	1	One thing's for sure - that won't stop people from claiming that it does!
-	-	Non-ionizing radiation *cannot* give you cancer.  I promise.
-	-	I haven't been more than 6 feet away from my phone in 3 years.... PHEW  (I work for a cell phone company :S)
-	-	Solar light is more cancer inducing than any cellphone radiation.  But like my gf would say the first is natural and the second is "chemical or something".  Try to explain reality to a bunch of retarded cocksuckers.  
-	-	Did they just re-analyze the Interphone study? I'd like to understand what the methodology faults were...
0	2	I didn't have time to read this I was talking on my droid phone and using the internet on my iphone
0	2	Good luck putting the shit back in that horse.  This story will get maybe 1/1000th the publicity of the recent "UN says cell phones cause cancer" story.
-	-	I thought cell-phone cancer was all but disproven *ages* ago...
-	-	"Smoking poses no risk to human health." -I rest my case.
1	6	There's a very interesting experiment similar to this, showing a possible way to eliminate any danger to cells from microwave radiation. http://www.iovs.org/content/49/5/2009.full  Adding white noise to the signal may prevent changes to DNA expression due to resonances.  Maybe the solution is to universally adopt the right kind of spread spectrum transmission.  Oh, someone has already filed a patent on electromagnetic resonance effects on chain molecules http://www.patents.com/us-6060293.html
-	-	The blood brain barrier permeability effects are interesting, though. There might be some other carcinogenic exposure, and the cell phone radiation is just slightly increasing the dose that hits the cells for a short time. It might explain why there's only a small increase in risk in the few studies that do actually find an increase, since the cancer in question is rare to begin with.
1	4	Welcome to the 21st century, my friend! We have a wealth of knowledge for you to peruse. Please, take your time and catch up on the abundance of information we already possess!
0	1	Did you just call your girlfriend a cocksucker?
-	-	People see radiation and think cancer/death/diarrhea without realizing that their remote uses radiation to flip channels. 
-	-	Do you know the difference between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation?
-	-	I would think anything with "UN says" in the title would immediately be viewed as invalid by anyone with sense.
0	1	Yes indeed, but she doesn't understand English, other than a few words, and she doesn't know that online I am an unrepentant degenerate misogynist.  BTW she is very Catholic like her insane family and it took a long time to make her a cocksucker and lots of Pinot Grigio.    
-	-	That has never been a scientific consensus. Since the earliest research, 80 years ago, all medical establishments have held that it's a direct cause of emphysema and lung cancer. The idea that doctors used to support it came from disinformation in 1950s-1960s marketing campaigns and from undereducated GPs in the tobacco-loving American south. Your quote is imaginary, and would be fallacious even if it were true. It's the equivalent of "Criminal X walked free even though he was later found to be guilty, therefore Not Guilty can never be a valid verdict again."
-	-	tell this to chicken in my microwave, or better tell that to sun and skin cancer...
1	7	No, please elucidate me with your infinite wisdom.
